Colorado now also has the largest annual production of beer of any state. The state's diverse geography and majestic mountains attract millions of tourists every year, including 85.2 million in 2018. Many counties and cities charge their own rates, in addition to the base state rate. Much of the state is sunny, and could produce solar power. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for ethanol production. It is integral to the US economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado.
