What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
In the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, aided by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority and, in the early 1940s, the city of Oak Ridge. Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Poultry, soybeans, and cattle are the state's primary agricultural products, and major manufacturing exports include chemicals, transportation equipment, and electrical equipment. In recent years, Tennessee has received an influx of people relocating from California, Florida, New York, New Jersey and the New England States for the low cost of living, and the booming healthcare and automobile industries. Major outputs for the state include textiles, cotton, cattle, and electrical power. Soybeans are also heavily planted in West Tennessee, focusing on the northwest corner of the state. Tennessee is also a major hub for the automotive industry. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%, the second-highest in the nation, along with Mississippi, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Indiana. While sales tax remains the main source of state government funding, property taxes are the primary source of revenue for local governments. Tourism contributes billions of dollars every year to the state's economy, and Tennessee is ranked among the Top 10 destinations in the nation. In 2014 a record 100 million people visited the state resulting in $17.7 billion in tourism related spending within the state, an increase of 6.3% over 2013; tax revenue from tourism equaled $1.5 billion. Tourism-generated jobs for the state reached 152,900, a 2.8% increase. Tennessee has very little petroleum and natural gas reserves, but is home to one oil refinery, in Memphis. Tennessee was also a top producer of phosphate until the early 1990s.

Mines in the basin supplied about 90% of the copper used by the Confederacy during the Civil War, and also marketed chemical byproducts of the mining, including sulfuric acid.
