What about this state's arts and culture attracts you the most?

Input:
In prehistoric times, the area was home to Ancestral Puebloans, Mogollon, and the modern extant Comanche and Utes inhabited the state. These indigenous, Hispanic, Mexican, Latin, and American frontier roots are reflected in the eponymous New Mexican cuisine and the New Mexico music genre. The indigenous cultures of New Mexico, however, proved to be unrelated to the Mexicas, and they were not wealthy, but the name persisted. Visitors also frequent the surviving native pueblos of New Mexico. The first known inhabitants of New Mexico were members of the Clovis culture of Paleo-Indians. Later inhabitants include American Indians of the Mogollon and Ancestral Pueblo peoples cultures. New Mexico played a role in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. European-American settlers in the state had an uneasy relationship with the large Native American tribes, most of whose members lived on reservations at the beginning of the 20th century. The pre-Columbian trade with Mesoamerican cultures included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper. As early as 1878, the ATSF promoted tourism in the region with emphasis on Native American imagery. With a Native American population of 134,000 in 1990, New Mexico ranks as an important center of Native American culture. The prehistorically agricultural Pueblo Indians live in pueblos scattered throughout the state. They settled in the state's northern portion. It uses numerous Native American words for local features and includes anglicized words that express American concepts and modern inventions. The earliest New Mexico artists whose work survives today are the Mimbres Indians, whose black and white pottery could be mistaken for modern art, except for the fact that it was produced before 1130 CE. Colonies for artists and writers thrive, and the small city teems with art galleries. In addition to other general interest theaters, Albuquerque also has the African American Performing Arts Center and Exhibit Hall which showcases achievements by people of African descent and the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center which highlights the cultural heritage of the First Nations people of New Mexico.

With a Native American population of 134,000 in 1990, New Mexico ranks as an important center of Native American culture. With 16 million acres (6,500,000 ha), mostly in neighboring Arizona, the reservation of the Navajo Nation ranks as the largest in the United States. Almost half of New Mexicans claim Hispanic origin Because of the historical isolation of New Mexico from other speakers of the Spanish language, some of the vocabulary of New Mexican Spanish is unknown to other Spanish speakers. Albuquerque has the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the National Hispanic Cultural Center, and the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, as well as hosts the famed annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta every fall. The earliest New Mexico artists whose work survives today are the Mimbres Indians, whose black and white pottery could be mistaken for modern art, except for the fact that it was produced before 1130 CE.
