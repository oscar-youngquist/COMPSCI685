It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States. Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to other US colonies. Meanwhile, Upstate South Carolina, west of the Fall Line, was settled by small farmers and traders, who displaced Native American tribes westward. In the Antebellum period (before the Civil War) the state's economy and population grew. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century; and created tourism industries. During the early part of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs, opportunities and relative freedom in US cities outside the former Confederate states. There are also numerous historic sites and museums scattered throughout the state paying homage to many events and periods in the state's history from Native American inhabitation to the present day. There are also countless local festivals throughout the state highlighting many cultural traditions, historical events, and folklore. Major agricultural outputs of the state are tobacco, poultry, cotton, cattle, dairy products, soybeans, hay, rice, and swine.
