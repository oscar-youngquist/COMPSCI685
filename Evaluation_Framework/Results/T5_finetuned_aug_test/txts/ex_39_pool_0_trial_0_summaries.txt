What are some of the most interesting things about this state?

Input:
New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by area and the 10th least populous US state. In the 1950s and 1960s, defense contractors moved into many of the former mills, such as Sanders Associates in Nashua; the population of southern New Hampshire surged beginning in the 1980s as major highways connected the region to Greater Boston and established several bedroom communities in the state. It is the state with the highest percentage of timberland area in the country. Much of the state, in particular the White Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. It contains less than 5% of the state's population, suffers relatively high poverty, and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline. Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state, and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. The center of population has moved south 12 miles (19 km) since 1950, a reflection of the fact the state's fastest growth has been along its southern border, which is within commuting range of Boston and other Massachusetts cities. The four counties covering these two areas account for 72% of the state population, and one (Hillsborough) has nearly 30% of the state population, as well as the two most populous communities, Manchester and Nashua. The trends over the past several decades have been for the population to shift southward, as many northern communities lack the economic base to maintain their populations, while southern communities have been absorbed by the Greater Boston metropolis. New Hampshire has the highest percentage (22.9%) of residents with French/French-Canadian/Acadian ancestry of any US state. They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the Southern United States. The state's largest economic sectors in 2018, based on contribution to GDP, are: 15% real estate and rental and leasing; 13% professional business services; 12% manufacturing; 10% government and government services; and 9% health care and social services. Efforts to diversify the state's general economy have been ongoing. New Hampshire's lack of a broad-based tax system has resulted in the state's local communities having some of the nation's highest property taxes. Even so, the legislature strongly favors local control, particularly with regard to land use regulations. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are the two largest parties in the state. In the 116th United States Congress, it is one of only eight states with an entirely Democratic delegation, five of which are in New England (the others are Delaware, Hawaii, and New Mexico).

New Hampshire () is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. In January 1776, it became the first of the British North American colonies to establish a government independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain's authority; it was the first to establish its own state constitution. Six months later, it became one of the original 13 colonies that signed the United States Declaration of Independence, and in June 1788 it was the ninth state to ratify the United States Constitution, bringing that document into effect. Historically, New Hampshire was a major center for textile manufacturing, shoemaking, and papermaking, with Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in Manchester at one time being the largest cotton textile plant in the world. New Hampshire is part of the six-state New England region. Various Algonquian-speaking Abenaki tribes, largely divided between the Androscoggin and Pennacook nations, inhabited the area before European settlement. The only battle fought in New Hampshire was the raid on Fort William and Mary, December 14, 1774, in Portsmouth Harbor, which netted the rebellion sizable quantities of gunpowder, small arms and cannon. The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of New Hampshire was 1,359,711 on July 1, 2019, a 3.28% increase since the 2010 United States Census. The racial makeup of New Hampshire as of the 2010 Census was: The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that New Hampshire's total state product in 2018 was $86 billion, ranking 40th in the United States. Historically, the base was composed of traditional New England textiles, shoe making, and small machine shops, drawing upon low-wage labor from nearby small farms and from parts of Quebec. According to the Energy Information Administration, New Hampshire's energy consumption and per capita energy consumption are among the lowest in the country. New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns. This primary, as the nation's first contest that uses the same procedure as the general election, draws more attention than those in other states, and it has been decisive in shaping the national contest. In the past, New Hampshire has often voted Republican. The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senatorte, a first for any legislative body in the United States.
