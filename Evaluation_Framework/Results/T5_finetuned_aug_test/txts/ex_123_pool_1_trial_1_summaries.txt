What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
The economy of New Mexico is dependent on oil drilling, mineral extraction, dryland farming, cattle ranching, acequia and landrace agriculture, lumber milling, retail trade, scientific research laboratories, technological development, as well as the arts, especially textiles and visual arts. Because of this, its film industry has grown and contributed $1.23 billion to its overall economy. Tourists visiting these sites bring significant money to the state. It included most of the present-day states of Arizona and New Mexico, and part of Colorado. In the 21st century, employment growth areas in New Mexico include electronic circuitry, scientific research, call centers, and Indian casinos. The state also has a large Native American population, second in percentage behind that of Alaska. Oil and gas production, tourism, and federal government spending are important drivers of the state economy. State government has an elaborate system of tax credits and technical assistance to promote job growth and business investment, especially in new technologies. In 2010, New Mexico's gross domestic product was $80 billion, and an estimated $85 billion for 2013. New Mexico is the third-largest crude oil and ninth-largest natural gas producer in the United States. In 2000 the value of oil and gas produced was $8.2 billion, and in 2006, New Mexico accounted for 3.4% of the crude oil, 8.5% of the dry natural gas, and 10.2% of the natural gas liquids produced in the United States. However, the boom in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling beginning in the mid-2010s led to a large increase in the production of crude oil from the Permian Basin and other US sources; these developments allowed the United States to again become the world's largest producer of crude oil in 2018. Federal government spending is a major driver of the New Mexico economy. A May 2005 estimate by New Mexico State University is that 11.65% of the state's total employment arises directly or indirectly from military spending. The state provides financial incentives for film production. With 16 million acres (6,500,000 ha), mostly in neighboring Arizona, the reservation of the Navajo Nation ranks as the largest in the United States.

New Mexico provides a number of economic incentives to businesses operating in the state, including various types of tax credits and tax exemptions. Most of the incentives are based on job creation. New Mexico law allows governments to provide land, buildings, and infrastructure to businesses to promote job creation. Several municipalities have imposed an Economic Development Gross Receipts Tax (a form of Municipal Infrastructure GRT) that is used to pay for these infrastructure improvements and for marketing their areas. The state provides financial incentives for film production. The New Mexico Film Office estimated at the end of 2007 that the incentive program had brought more than 85 film projects to the state since 2003 and had added $1.2 billion to the economy. New Mexico is one of the largest tax havens in the US, offering numerous economic incentives and tax breaks on personal and corporate income.
