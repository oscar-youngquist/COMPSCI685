What are some of the most interesting things about this state?

Input:
It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who comprise a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory. South Dakota is the seventeenth largest by area, but the 5th least populous, and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. The state is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as "East River" and "West River". Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome. Humans have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. South Dakota is in the north-central United States, and is considered a part of the Midwest by the US Census Bureau; it is also part of the Great Plains region. The culture, economy, and geography of western South Dakota have more in common with the West than the Midwest. Humans have lived in what is today South Dakota for several thousand years. In 1762 the entire region became part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802. Ethnically, 2.7% of South Dakota's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). As of 2000, the five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are German (40.7%), Norwegian (15.3%), Irish (10.4%), Native American (8.3%), and English (7.1%). German Americans are the largest ancestry group in most parts of the state, especially in East River (east of the Missouri River), although there are also large Scandinavian-descended populations in some counties. American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux), are predominant in several counties and constitute 20 per cent of the population in West River. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska and New Mexico. During that time, nine counties had a population loss of greater than 10%, with Harding County, in the northwest corner of the state, losing nearly 19% of its population. South Dakota's culture reflects the state's American Indian, rural, Western, and European roots. The next eight largest cities in the state, in order of descending 2010 population, are Aberdeen (26,091), Brookings (22,056), Watertown (21,482), Mitchell (15,254), Yankton (14,454), Pierre (13,646), Huron (12,592), and Vermillion (10,571).
\Predicted Summary:
is the 17th largest by area, but the 5th least populous, and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 . South Dakota is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing the state into two halves . the state is a state in the midwestern region of the united states .

South Dakota ( (listen)) is a US state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who comprise a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory. South Dakota is the seventeenth largest by area, but the 5th least populous, and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts.Mammals in this area include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, and prairie dogs. South Dakota has a continental climate with four distinct seasons, ranging from cold, dry winters to warm and semi-humid summers. The state's eastern part is often considered part of Tornado Alley, and South Dakota experiences an average of 30 tornadoes each year. Severe blizzards and ice storms often occur during winter. Humans have lived in what is today South Dakota for several thousand years. The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC. By 1500, the Arikara (or Ree) had settled in much of the Missouri River valley. European contact with the area began in 1743, when the LaVÃ©rendrye brothers explored the region. In 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory, an area that included most of South Dakota, from Napoleon Bonaparte, and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly referred to as the "Lewis and Clark Expedition" to explore the region. The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of South Dakota was 884,659 on July 1, 2019, an 8.66% increase since the 2010 United States Census, only North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming have fewer residents. Ethnically, 2.7% of South Dakota's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). As of 2000, the five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are German (40.7%), Norwegian (15.3%), Irish (10.4%), Native American (8.3%), and English (7.1%). In 1995 the legislature passed a law to make English the "common language" of the state. Since 2019, "the language of the Great Sioux Nation, comprised of three dialects, Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota" is an official language. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Roman Catholic Church with 148,883 members; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) with 112,649 members; and the United Methodist Church (UMC) with 36,020 members. The current-dollar gross state product of South Dakota was $39.8 billion as of 2010, the fifth-smallest total state output in the US
