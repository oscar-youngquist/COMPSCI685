Although one of the smallest states in the US, it features a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of America in Miniature. In a similar vein, Maryland's geography, culture, and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the country. Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, mostly by the Algonquin, and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux. The state's central role in US history is reflected by its hosting of some of the highest numbers of historic landmarks per capita. Maryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname America in Miniature. (The Commonwealth of Virginia gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of Alexandria, Virginia, however, Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). All lakes in the state today were constructed, mostly via dams. The state harbors a considerable number of white-tailed deer, especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state, and overpopulation can become a problem. Maryland joined with neighboring states during the end of the 20th century to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Compared to some other states, blacks were better established both before and after the civil war. Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Maryland's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States. The two westernmost counties of Maryland, Allegany and Garrett, are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia and Appalachia more than they do the rest of the state. Hispanic immigrants of the later 20th century have settled in Aspen Hill, Hyattsville/Langley Park, Glenmont/Wheaton, Bladensburg, Riverdale Park, Gaithersburg, as well as Highlandtown and Greektown in East Baltimore. Numerous Indian Americans live across the state, especially in central Maryland. Mining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist. Tourism is popular in Maryland.

Among its occasional nicknames are Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the US capital of Washington, D.C. The Appalachian Mountains of western Maryland are home to Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. There is a population of rare wild (feral) horses found on Assateague Island. Officially, the new "Maryland Colony" was named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I of England. The border dispute with Pennsylvania led to Cresap's War in the 1730s. During the colonial era, families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and African men. Near the end of the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783), on February 2, 1781, Maryland became the last and 13th state to approve the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, first proposed in 1776 and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in 1778, which brought into being the United States as a united, sovereign and national state. Abolitionist Harriet Tubman was born a slave during this time in Dorchester County, Maryland. During this bombardment the song "Star Spangled Banner" was written by Francis Scott Key; it was later adopted as the national anthem. Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks suspended the state legislature, and to help ensure the election of a new pro-union governor and legislature, President Abraham Lincoln had a number of its pro-slavery politicians arrested, including the Mayor of Baltimore, George William Brown; suspended several civil liberties, including habeas corpus; and ordered artillery placed on Federal Hill overlooking Baltimore. Of the 115,000 men from Maryland who joined the military during the Civil War, 85,000, or 77%, joined the Union army, while the remainder joined the Confederate Army. A new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a "Free State" in that context. The Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. Baltimore was a major war production center during World War II. Spanish (including Spanish Creole) is the second most spoken language in Maryland, after English. Maryland is a major center for life sciences research and development. Institutions and government agencies with an interest in research and development located in Maryland include the Johns Hopkins University, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, more than one campus of the University System of Maryland, Goddard Space Flight Center, the United States Census Bureau, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Celera Genomics company, the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), and AstraZeneca (formerly MedImmune). Attractions in Baltimore include the Harborplace, the Baltimore Aquarium, Fort McHenry, as well as the Camden Yards baseball stadium.Ocean City on the Atlantic Coast has been a popular beach destination in summer, particularly since the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built in 1952 connecting the Eastern Shore to the more populated Maryland cities. Maryland has several historic and renowned private colleges and universities, the most prominent of which is Johns Hopkins University, founded in 1876 with a grant from Baltimore entrepreneur Johns Hopkins.
