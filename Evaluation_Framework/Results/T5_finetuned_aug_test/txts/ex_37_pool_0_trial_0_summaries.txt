Native American peoples lived in what is now North Dakota for thousands of years before the coming of Europeans. They both assembled in villages on tributaries of the Missouri River in what would become west-central North Dakota. The Shoshone Indians in present-day Wyoming and Montana may have carried out attacks on Indian enemies as far east as the Missouri. Due to attacks by Crees, Assiniboines and Chippewas armed with fire weapons, they left the area around 1780 and crossed Missouri some time after. They soon followed the Cheyennes across Missouri and lived among them south of Cannonball River. Congress passed an omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington, titled the Enabling Act of 1889, on February 22, 1889 during the administration of President Grover Cleveland.
