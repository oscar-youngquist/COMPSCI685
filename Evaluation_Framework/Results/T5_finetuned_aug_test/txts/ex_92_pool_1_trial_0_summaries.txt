Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. Interstate 25 (I-25) is the primary north–south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. I-70 is the primary east–west corridor. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado, and is the busiest US hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States. Extensive public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city—including the Denver metro area's extensive RTD services. Amtrak operates two passenger rail lines in Colorado, the California Zephyr and Southwest Chief. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.
