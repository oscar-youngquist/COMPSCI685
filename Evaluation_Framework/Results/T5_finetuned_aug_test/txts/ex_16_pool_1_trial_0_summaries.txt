What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
The economy of New Mexico is dependent on oil drilling, mineral extraction, dryland farming, cattle ranching, acequia and landrace agriculture, lumber milling, retail trade, scientific research laboratories, technological development, as well as the arts, especially textiles and visual arts. In the 21st century, employment growth areas in New Mexico include electronic circuitry, scientific research, call centers, and Indian casinos. The state also has a large Native American population, second in percentage behind that of Alaska. Oil and gas production, tourism, and federal government spending are important drivers of the state economy. In 2010, New Mexico's gross domestic product was $80 billion, and an estimated $85 billion for 2013. New Mexico is the third-largest crude oil and ninth-largest natural gas producer in the United States. However, the boom in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling beginning in the mid-2010s led to a large increase in the production of crude oil from the Permian Basin and other US sources; these developments allowed the United States to again become the world's largest producer of crude oil in 2018. A May 2005 estimate by New Mexico State University is that 11.65% of the state's total employment arises directly or indirectly from military spending.
