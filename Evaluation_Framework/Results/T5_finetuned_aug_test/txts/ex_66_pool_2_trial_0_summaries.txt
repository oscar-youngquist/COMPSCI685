A steady stream of governors appointed by the president quit the position, often citing the traditions of their supposed territorial government. Like most of the western and southwestern states, the federal government owns much of the land in Utah. Utah government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The governor is elected for a four-year term. The Utah State Legislature consists of a Senatorte and a House of Representatives. State senators serve four-year terms and representatives two-year terms. The Utah Legislature meets each year in January for an annual 45-day session. It consists of five justices, who are appointed by the governor, and then subject to retention election. All justices and judges, like those on the Utah Supreme Court, are subject to retention election after appointment. Utah is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties.
