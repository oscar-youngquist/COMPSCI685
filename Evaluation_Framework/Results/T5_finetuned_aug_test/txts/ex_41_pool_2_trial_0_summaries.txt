Input:
Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Maryland was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, mostly by the Algonquin, and to a lesser degree by the Iroquois and Sioux. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the settlement of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. In 1790, the state ceded land for the establishment of the US capital of Washington, D.C. This land was ceded to the United States Federal Government in 1790 to form the District of Columbia. (The Commonwealth of Virginia gave land south of the Potomac, including the town of Alexandria, Virginia, however, Virginia retroceded its portion in 1846). Many of the free black families migrated to Delaware, where land was cheaper. Near the end of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), on February 2, 1781, Maryland became the last and 13th state to approve the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, first proposed in 1776 and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in 1778, which brought into being the United States as a united, sovereign and national state. The land was provided along the north shore of the Potomac River from Montgomery and Prince George's counties, as well as from Fairfax County and Alexandria on the south shore of the Potomac in Virginia; however, the land donated by the Commonwealth of Virginia was later returned to that state by the District of Columbia retrocession in 1846. The state remained with the Union during the Civil War, due in significant part to demographics and Federal intervention. Compared to some other states, blacks were better established both before and after the civil war. Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state.

Maryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Although then a slave state, Maryland remained in the Union during the American Civil War, its strategic location giving it a significant role in the conflict. George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore (1579–1632), sought a charter from King Charles I for the territory between Massachusetts to the north and Virginia to the immediate south.After the first Lord Baltimore died in April 1632, the charter was granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), on June 20, 1632. The original capital of Maryland was St. Mary's City, on the north shore of the Potomac River, and the county surrounding it, the first erected/created in the province, was first called Augusta Carolina, after the King, and later named St. Mary's County. The border dispute with Pennsylvania led to Cresap's War in the 1730s. Negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. Maryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. Influenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the Revolutionary War. The state remained with the Union during the Civil War, due in significant part to demographics and Federal intervention. A new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a "Free State" in that context. The Progressive Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms. Maryland experienced population growth following World War II.
