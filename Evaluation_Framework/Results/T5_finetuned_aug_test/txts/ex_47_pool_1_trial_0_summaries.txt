How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Until 2010, the governor was the only statewide elected executive official in the state and appointed numerous government officials. Formerly, an acting governor was even more powerful as he simultaneously served as president of the New Jersey State Senatorte, thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature, consisting of an upper house Senatorte of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Tax Court judges are appointed by the governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships. Depending on the county, the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government. In 16 counties, members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments. The governor's appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party; for instance, the attorney general is a Democrat.

The position of Governor of New Jersey has been considered one of the most powerful in the nation. Until 2010, the governor was the only statewide elected executive official in the state and appointed numerous government officials. Phil Murphy (D) is the governor. Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a lieutenant governor. Republican Kim Guadagno was elected the first lieutenant governor of New Jersey and took office on January 19, 2010. The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 1947. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature, consisting of an upper house Senatorte of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years. The New Jersey Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and six associate justices. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county. The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division, which functions as the state's intermediate appellate court. There is also a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. The Faulkner Act, originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: Mayor-Council, Council-Manager, Small Municipality, and Mayor-Council-Administrator.
