It is also part of the Western and the Mountain states. It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Arizona shares the Four Corners region with Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico; its other neighboring states are Nevada and California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest. The boom and bust economy of mining also left hundreds of ghost towns across the territory, but copper mining continued to prosper with the territory producing more copper than any other state by 1907, which earned Arizona the nickname "the Copper State" at the time of statehood. The state continues to produce half of the nation's newly mined copper. Arizona is the sixth largest state by area, ranked after New Mexico and before Nevada. The remaining area is public forest and park land, state trust land and Native American reservations. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the Colorado Plateau (see Arizona Mountains forests). Like other states of the Southwest United States, Arizona has an abundance of mountains and plateaus. (The large Navajo Nation in the state's northeastern region does.) Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. With 212,635 residents, this cluster of towns is the state's third largest metropolitan area. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors. The state's per capita income is $40,828, ranking 39th in the US The state had a median household income of $50,448, making it 22nd in the country and just below the US national mean. Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see Copper mining in Arizona), cotton, cattle, citrus, and climate (tourism).
