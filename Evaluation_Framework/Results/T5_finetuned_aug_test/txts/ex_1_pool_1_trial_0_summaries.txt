I-84 is the main highway linking the southeast and southwest portions of the state, along with I-86 and I-15. Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland, and Spokane to the west, and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east.
