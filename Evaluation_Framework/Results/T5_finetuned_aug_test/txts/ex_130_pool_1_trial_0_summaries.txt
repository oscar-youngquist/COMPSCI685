Input:
Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 19th-least populous, but the 9th-least densely populated of the US states. About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the US federal government, both civilian and military. Much of the northern part of the state is within the Great Basin, a mild desert that experiences hot temperatures in the summer and cold temperatures in the winter. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Nevada is the most mountainous state in the contiguous United States. Nevada is the driest state in the United States. The vegetation of Nevada is diverse and differs by state area. Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the US percentage-wise. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation. Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the top 20 fastest-growing US cities with populations over 100,000. The state's per capita personal income in 2018 was $43,820, ranking 35th in the nation. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. With the advent of air conditioning for summertime use and Southern Nevada's mild winters, the fortunes of the state began to turn around, as it did for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growing in the Union. Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. The more rural counties of the north are among the most conservative regions of the country. The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations.
