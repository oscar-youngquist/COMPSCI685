The first European to reach the area was the French-Canadian trader Pierre Gaultier, sieur de La VÃ©rendrye, who led an exploration and trading party to the Mandan villages in 1738. guided by Assiniboine Indians. Congress passed an omnibus bill for statehood for North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington, titled the Enabling Act of 1889, on February 22, 1889 during the administration of President Grover Cleveland. His successor, Benjamin Harrison, signed the proclamations formally admitting North Dakota and South Dakota to the Union on November 2, 1889.
