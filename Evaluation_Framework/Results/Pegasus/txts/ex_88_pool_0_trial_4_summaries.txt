The first European to see Vermont is thought to have been French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1535. Following France's loss in the French and Indian War, through the 1763 Treaty of Paris, it ceded control of land east of the Mississippi River to the British. On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of Vermont. On June 2, 1777, a second convention of 72 delegates met and adopted the name "Vermont." He was advising them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States of America as the 14th state. On July 4, they completed the drafting of the Constitution of Vermont at the Windsor Tavern, and adopted it on July 8. The Battle of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont and the United States. The battles of Bennington and Saratoga together are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army. Congress acted on February 18, 1791, to admit Vermont to the Union as the 14th state as of March 4, 1791. Vermont became the first to enter the Union after the original 13 states. The northernmost land action of the war was the St. Albans Raidâ€”the robbery of three St. Albans banks, perpetrated in October 1864 by 21 Confederate agents. In 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law. A major flood occurred in 1973, causing the deaths of two people and millions of dollars in property damage. On January 22, 2018, Vermont became the first of the United States to legalize cannabis for recreational use by legislative action, and the ninth state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medical purposes.
