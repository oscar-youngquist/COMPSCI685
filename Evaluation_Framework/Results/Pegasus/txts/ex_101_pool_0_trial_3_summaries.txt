Hawaii ( (listen) hə-WY-ee; Hawaiian: Hawaiʻi [həˈvɐjʔi] or [həˈwɐjʔi]) is a US state located in the Pacific Ocean. It is the only state outside North America, the only island state, and the only state in the tropics. A common Hawaiian explanation of the name of Hawaiʻi is that it was named for Hawaiʻiloa, a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth. There are eight main Hawaiian islands, seven of which are permanently inhabited. The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the Hawaiʻi hotspot. Hawaiʻi has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other US state. On a single island, the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimeters annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes, environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters per year), through a temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold, dry climate. Hawaiʻi is one of two states that were widely recognized independent nations prior to joining the United States. The Kingdom of Hawaiʻi was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident American and European capitalists and landholders. Hawaiʻi was an independent republic from 1894 until August 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the United States. Coincidentally, the Wiki knowledge revolution that transformed the Internet took its name from a Hawaiian word. The average projected lifespan of people born in Hawaii in 2000 is 79.8 years; 77.1 years if male, 82.5 if female—longer than the average lifespan of any other US state. As of 2011 the US military reported it had 42,371 personnel on the islands. According to the 2010 United States Census, Hawaii had a population of 1,360,301. The state's population identified as 38.6% Asian; 24.7% White (22.7% non-Hispanic White alone); 23.6% from two or more races; 10.0% Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders; 8.9% Hispanics and Latinos of any race; 1.6% Black or African American; 1.2% from some other race; and 0.3% Native American and Alaska Native. English and Hawaiian are listed as Hawaii's official languages in the state's 1978 constitution, in Article XV, Section 4. Hawaiʻi Creole English, locally referred to as "Pidgin", is the native language of many native residents and is a second language for many others. Some residents of Hawaii speak Hawaiʻi Creole English (HCE), endonymically called pidgin or pidgin English. Christianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii, mainly represented by various Protestants groups, Roman Catholics and Mormons. Hawaii has had a long history of LGBT identities.
