During his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor Sam Brownback called for a complete "phase out of Kansas's income tax". He made cuts to education and some state services to offset lost revenue. Education in Kansas is governed at the primary and secondary school level by the Kansas State Board of Education. The state's public colleges and universities are supervised by the Kansas Board of Regents. Twice since 1999 the Board of Education has approved changes in the state science curriculum standards that encouraged the teaching of intelligent design. Both times, the standards were reversed after changes in the composition of the board in the next election.
