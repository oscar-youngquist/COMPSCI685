What are some of the most interesting things about this state?
\Predicted Summary:
Colorado is a state in the western United States encompassing most of the southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains.

GT:
Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, which includes alpine mountains, high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons. The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 true peaks with a total of 58 that are 14,000 feet (4,267 m) or higher in elevation above sea level, known as fourteeners. These mountains are largely covered with trees such as conifers and aspens up to the tree line, at an elevation of about 12,000 feet (3,658 m) in southern Colorado to about 10,500 feet (3,200 m) in northern Colorado. Above this tree line only alpine vegetation grows. The Colorado plains are mostly prairies but also include deciduous forests, buttes, and canyons. Eastern Colorado is presently mainly farmland and rangeland, along with small farming villages and towns. Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of Tornado Alley; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the 2008 Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town. The Plains are also susceptible to occasional floods and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Much of Colorado is very dry, with the state averaging only 17 inches (430 millimeters) of precipitation per year statewide. Spanish is the second-most spoken language in Colorado, after English. According to several studies, Coloradans have the lowest rates of obesity of any state in the US. According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, residents of Colorado had a 2014 life expectancy of 80.21 years, the longest of any US state. There are also a number of established film festivals in Colorado, including Aspen Shortsfest, Boulder International Film Festival, Castle Rock Film Festival, Denver Film Festival, Festivus Film Festival (ended in 2013), Mile High Horror Film Festival, Moondance International Film Festival, Mountainfilm in Telluride, Rocky Mountain Women's Film Festival, and Telluride Film Festival. Colorado is known for its Southwest and Rocky Mountain cuisine. Mexican restaurants are prominent throughout the state. Colorado wines include award-winning varietals that have attracted favorable notice from outside the state. Colorado is open to cannabis (marijuana) tourism. As of December 2018, the state's unemployment rate was 4.2%. Colorado is considered a swing state or (more recently) a blue state in both state and federal elections.
