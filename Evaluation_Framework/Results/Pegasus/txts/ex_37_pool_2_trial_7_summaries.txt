California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States. With over 39.3 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous US state and the third-largest by area, as well as the world's thirty-fourth-most-populous subnational entity. California is also the most populated subnational entity in North America, and has its state capital in Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second-most-populous, after New York City. California's economy, with a gross state product of $3.2 trillion as of 2019, is the largest sub-national economy in the world. If it were a country, California would be the fifth-largest economy in the world, and the 37th-most populous as of 2020. California is considered a global trendsetter in popular culture, communication, information, innovation, environmentalism, economics, politics, and entertainment. The Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula of Baja California and to Alta California, the region that became the present-day state of California. The name likely derived from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of Queen Calafia, as recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandián by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo. California's mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side, creating extensive deserts. California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. The population is projected to reach forty million by 2020 and fifty million by 2060. The state has 482 incorporated cities and towns, of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns. The culture of California is a Western culture and most clearly has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences. Hollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the US film industry's "Big Five" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) being based in or around the area. California has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual Rose Bowl, among others. California is the only US state to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
