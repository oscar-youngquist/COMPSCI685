Archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution. The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda. When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, American authorities insisted the agreement also included Texas. The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against Mexican rule, and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president. On December 29, 1845, Congress admitted Texas to the US as a constituent state of the Union. In return, for US$18,250,000, Mexico gave the US undisputed control of Texas, ceded the Mexican Cession in 1848, most of which today is called the American Southwest, and Texas's borders were established at the Rio Grande. Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4, 1861 ratifying the permanent C.S. Constitution on March 23. In 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in US history during the Galveston hurricane. The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt a double blow to the state's economy, which had significantly improved since the Civil War. World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; the colleges took on new roles; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture. On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.
