How is the weather of the state?
\Predicted Summary:
North Dakota is celebrating its 125th anniversary as a state.

GT:
Most of the state is covered in grassland This diverse terrain supports nearly 2,000 species of plants. North Dakota has a continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. The temperature differences are significant because of its far inland position and being in the center of the Northern Hemisphere, with roughly equal distances to the North Pole and the Equator. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions. A unique feature of the North Dakota Interstate Highway system is virtually all of it is paved in concrete, not blacktop, because of the extreme weather conditions it must endure.
