From 2009 to 2019, over 200 private schools in Michigan closed, partly due to competition from charter schools. The University of Michigan is the oldest higher-educational institution in the state, and among the oldest research universities in the nation. It was founded in 1817, 20 years before Michigan Territory achieved statehood. Michigan State University has the eighth largest campus population of any US school as of fall, 2016. With an enrollment of 21,210 students, Baker College is Michigan's largest private post-secondary institution. The Carnegie Foundation classifies ten of the state's institutions (University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Eastern Michigan University, Central Michigan University, Western Michigan University, Michigan Technological University, Oakland University, Andrews University, and Baker College) as research universities.
