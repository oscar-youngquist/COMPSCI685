The first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León, who called it la Florida ([la floˈɾiða] "the land of flowers") upon landing there. Today, Florida is distinctive for its large Cuban expatriate community and high population growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues. Florida is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; African, European, indigenous, Latino, and Asian heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. In 1565, the settlement of St. Augustine (San Agustín) was established under the leadership of admiral and governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, creating what would become one of the oldest, continuously-occupied European settlements in the continental US and establishing the first generation of Floridanos and the Government of Florida. In 1830, the US Congress passed the Indian Removal Act and as settlement increased, pressure grew on the US government to remove the Indians from Florida. At 345 feet (105 m) above mean sea level, Britton Hill is the highest point in Florida and the lowest highpoint of any US state. Central Florida is known as the lightning capital of the United States, as it experiences more lightning strikes than anywhere else in the country. Florida leads the United States in tornadoes per area (when including waterspouts), but they do not typically reach the intensity of those in the Midwest and Great Plains. Hurricanes pose a severe threat each year from June 1 to November 30, particularly from August to October. The Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States. All potable water resources have been controlled by the state government through five regional water authorities since 1972. The Florida peninsula is a porous plateau of karst limestone sitting atop bedrock known as the Florida Platform. The largest deposits of potash in the United States are found in Florida. The largest deposits of rock phosphate in the country are found in Florida. Extended systems of underwater caves, sinkholes and springs are found throughout the state and supply most of the water used by residents. Florida's economy ranks among the largest in the world. In 2017, Florida became the United States' eighth largest exporter of trade goods. In 2017, Florida's per capita personal income was $47,684, ranking 26th in the nation. In the early 20th century, land speculators discovered Florida, and businessmen such as Henry Plant and Henry Flagler developed railroad systems, which led people to move in, drawn by the weather and local economies.
