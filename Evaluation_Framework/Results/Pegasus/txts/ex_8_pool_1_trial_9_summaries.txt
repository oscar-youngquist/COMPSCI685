The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León. In May 1539, Conquistador Hernando de Soto skirted the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. In 1564-65 there was a French settlement at Fort Caroline, in present Duval County, which was destroyed by the Spanish. In 1565, the settlement of St. Augustine (San Agustín) was established under the leadership of admiral and governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, creating what would become one of the oldest, continuously-occupied European settlements in the continental US and establishing the first generation of Floridanos and the Government of Florida. In 1738, the Spanish governor of Florida Manuel de Montiano established Fort Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose near St. Augustine, a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom Montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the Florida militia, and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in North America. In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years' War. The British divided and consolidated the Florida provinces (Las Floridas) into East Florida and West Florida, a division the Spanish government kept after the brief British period. Spain regained both East and West Florida after Britain's defeat in the Revolutionary War and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles in 1783, and continued the provincial divisions until 1821. In 1810, parts of West Florida were annexed by proclamation of President James Madison, who claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase. By the early 1800s, Indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern US and also in Florida. In 1830, the US Congress passed the Indian Removal Act and as settlement increased, pressure grew on the US government to remove the Indians from Florida. Some Seminoles remained, and the US Army arrived in Florida, leading to the Second Seminole War (1835–1842). On March 3, 1845, only one day before the end of President John Tyler's term in office, Florida became the 27th state, admitted as a slave state and no longer a sanctuary for runaway slaves. On January 10, 1861, nearly all delegates in the Florida Legislature approved an ordinance of secession, declaring Florida to be "a sovereign and independent nation"—an apparent reassertion to the preamble in Florida's Constitution of 1838, in which Florida agreed with Congress to be a "Free and Independent State." Following the American Civil War, Florida's congressional representation was restored on June 25, 1868, albeit forcefully after Radical Reconstruction and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders. In the pre-automobile era, railroads played a key role in the state's development, particularly in coastal areas. Until the mid-20th century, Florida was the least populous state in the southern United States. Economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida and related development of hotels and resort communities. Subsequently, the growing availability of air conditioning, the climate, and a low cost of living made the state a haven. The population of Florida has boomed in recent years with the state being the recipient of the largest number of out-of-state movers in the country as of 2019.
