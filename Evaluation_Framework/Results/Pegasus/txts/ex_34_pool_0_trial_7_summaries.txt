GT:
Hawaii encompasses nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, composed of 137 volcanic islands spanning 1,500 miles (2,400 km), which are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. Two-thirds of the population lives on the island of O'ahu, home to the state's capital and largest city, Honolulu. Hawaii is among the most diverse states in the country, owing to its central location in the Pacific and over two centuries of migration; it has the nation's only Asian American majority, largest Buddhist community, and largest proportion of multiracial people. Settled by Polynesians some time between 124 and 1120, Hawaii was home to numerous independent chiefdoms. Hawaii became a unified, internationally recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until Western businessmen overthrew the monarchy in 1893; this led to annexation by the US in 1898. As a strategically valuable US territory, Hawaii was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global and historical significance, and contributed to America's decisive entry into World War II. Hawaii became the most recent state to join the union on August 21, 1959. Historically dominated by a plantation economy, Hawaii remains a major agricultural exporter due to its fertile soil and uniquely tropical climate in the US Its economy has gradually diversified since the mid 20th century, with tourism and military defense becoming the two largest sectors. The state attracts tourists, surfers, and scientists from around the world with its diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big Island. Hawaii hosts the US Pacific Fleet, the largest naval command in the world, as well as 75,000 employees of the Defense Department. It is the only US state that is not geographically located in North America, the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago, and the only state in which coffee is commercially cultivable. The process is continuing to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. The Kīlauea erupted in May 2018, opening 22 fissure vents on its East Rift Zone. Hawaiʻi has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other US state. The average projected lifespan of people born in Hawaii in 2000 is 79.8 years; 77.1 years if male, 82.5 if female—longer than the average lifespan of any other US state. Hawaiʻi Creole English, locally referred to as "Pidgin", is the native language of many native residents and is a second language for many others. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey. Hawaii residents pay the most per person in state taxes in the United States. Hawaii's musical contributions to the music of the United States are out of proportion to the state's small size. While Hawaii is internationally recognized as a state of the United States while also being broadly accepted as such in mainstream understanding, the legality of this status has been questioned in US District Court, the U.N., and other international forums.
