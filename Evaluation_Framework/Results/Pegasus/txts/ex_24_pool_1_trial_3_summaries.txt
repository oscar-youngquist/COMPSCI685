Mississippi ( (listen)) is a state in the Deep South region of the Southern United States, bordered to the north by Tennessee; to the east by Alabama; to the south by the Gulf of Mexico; to the southwest by Louisiana; and to the northwest by Arkansas. Mississippi is the 32nd largest and 34th-most populous of the 50 US states. On December 10, 1817, Mississippi became the 20th state admitted to the Union. The state's name is derived from the Mississippi River, which flows along and defines its western boundary. European-American settlers named it after the Ojibwe word misi-ziibi (English: Great river). Mississippi is bordered to the north by Tennessee, to the east by Alabama, to the south by Louisiana and a narrow coast on the Gulf of Mexico; and to the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and Arkansas. Mississippi has a humid subtropical climate with long, hot and humid summers, and short, mild winters. Temperatures average about 81 째F (27 째C) in July and about 42 째F (6 째C) in January. Mississippi is heavily forested, with over half of the state's area covered by wild or cultivated trees. Due to seasonal flooding, possible from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta. In the Mississippi Delta, Native American settlements and agricultural fields were developed on the natural levees, higher ground in the proximity of rivers. The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, Hernando de Soto, who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Mississippi was 2,976,149 on July 1, 2019, a 0.30% increase since the 2010 census. Ethnically, 2.7% of the total population, among all racial groups, was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race). In 2000, 96.4% of Mississippi residents five years old and older spoke only English in the home, a decrease from 97.2% in 1990. Under French and Spanish rule beginning in the 17th century, European colonists were mostly Roman Catholics. Of those same-sex couples roughly 33% contained at least one child, giving Mississippi the distinction of leading the nation in the percentage of same-sex couples raising children. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Mississippi's total state product in 2010 was $98 billion.
