Iowa ( (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern United States, bordered by the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west. It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north. Iowa derives its name from the Ioway people, one of the many Native American nations whose territory comprised the future state at the time of European colonization. Iowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. Several natural lakes exist, most notably Spirit Lake, West Okoboji Lake, and East Okoboji Lake in northwest Iowa (see Iowa Great Lakes). Iowa's natural vegetation is tallgrass prairie and savanna in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas. Iowa has a humid continental climate throughout the state (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with extremes of both heat and cold. The average annual temperature at Des Moines is 50 °F (10 °C); for some locations in the north, such as Mason City, the figure is about 45 °F (7 °C), while Keokuk, on the Mississippi River, averages 52 °F (11 °C). When American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. The first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indigenous villages on the Iowa side. Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Iowa was 3,155,070 on July 1, 2019, a 3.57% increase since the 2010 Census. Of the residents of Iowa, 70.8% were born in Iowa, 23.6% were born in a different US state, 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, US Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5% were foreign born. Iowa's population is more urban than rural, with 61 percent living in urban areas in 2000, a trend that began in the early 20th century. A 2014 survey by Pew Research Center found 60% of Iowans are Protestant, while 18% are Catholic, and 1% are of non-Christian religions. English is the most common language in Iowa, used by 94% of the population. After English, Spanish is the second-most-common language spoken in Iowa, with 120,000 people in Iowa of Hispanic or Latino origin and 47,000 people born in Latin America. If the economy is measured by gross domestic product, in 2005 Iowa's GDP was about $124 billion. This made Iowa the third state in the US and first in the Midwest to permit same-sex marriage.
