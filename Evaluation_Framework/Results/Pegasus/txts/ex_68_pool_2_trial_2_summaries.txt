The region has been inhabited by Native Americans for more than 13,000 years, with the Lindenmeier Site containing artifacts dating from approximately 9200 BCE to 1000 BCE; the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1, 1876, US President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state. The Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to US involvement in the region. The US acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. In 1806, Zebulon Pike led a US Army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the US with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo at the conclusion of the war in 1848. On April 9, 1851, Mexican American settlers from the area of Taos settled the village of San Luis, then in the New Mexico Territory, later to become Colorado's first permanent Euro-American settlement. The discovery of a major silver lode near Leadville in 1878 triggered the Colorado Silver Boom. Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant universal suffrage and the first one by a popular vote (of Colorado men). Poor labor conditions and discontent among miners resulted in several major clashes between strikers and the Colorado National Guard, including the 1903-1904 Western Federation of Miners Strike and Colorado Coalfield War, the latter of which included the Ludlow massacre that killed a dozen women and children. Both the 1913-1914 Coalfield War and the Denver streetcar strike of 1920 resulted in federal troops intervening to end the violence. In 1927, the Columbine Mine massacre resulted in six dead strikers following a confrontation with Colorado Rangers. On September 11, 1957, a plutonium fire occurred at the Rocky Flats Plant, which resulted in the significant plutonium contamination of surrounding populated areas.
