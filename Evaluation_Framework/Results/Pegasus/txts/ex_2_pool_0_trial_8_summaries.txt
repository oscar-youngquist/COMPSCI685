It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who comprise a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory. Native American peoples lived in what is now North Dakota for thousands of years before the coming of Europeans. The first European to reach the area was the French-Canadian trader Pierre Gaultier, sieur de La VÃ©rendrye, who led an exploration and trading party to the Mandan villages in 1738. guided by Assiniboine Indians. Harrison directed Secretary of State James G. Blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first. The actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first. North Dakota is one of the top resettlement locations for refugees proportionally.
