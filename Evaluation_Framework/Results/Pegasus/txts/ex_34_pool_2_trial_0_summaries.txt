\Predicted Summary:
California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States.

GT:
With over 39.3 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous US state and the third-largest by area, as well as the world's thirty-fourth-most-populous subnational entity. California's economy, with a gross state product of $3.2 trillion as of 2019, is the largest sub-national economy in the world. California is considered a global trendsetter in popular culture, communication, information, innovation, environmentalism, economics, politics, and entertainment. It is considered the origin of the hippie counterculture, beach and car culture, the Internet, and the personal computer, among others. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexicanâ€“American War. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom. Settled by successive waves of arrivals during at least the last 13,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. These huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. In later decades, the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias, which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them. As a result of these efforts, California is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology, engineering, and the aerospace industry, and as the United States center of agricultural production. The range embraces Yosemite Valley, famous for its glacially carved domes, and Sequoia National Park, home to the giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the state by volume. As part of the Ring of Fire, California is subject to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds, wildfires, landslides on steep terrain, and has several volcanoes. California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. According to estimates from 2011, California has the largest minority population in the United States by numbers, making up 60% of the state population. Hollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the US film industry's "Big Five" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) being based in or around the area. The San Francisco Bay Area is home to several prominent internet media and social media companies, including three of the "Big Five" technology companies (Apple, Facebook, and Google) as well as other services such as Netflix, Pandora Radio, Twitter, Yahoo!, and YouTube. California has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. However because of its high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States. California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion.
