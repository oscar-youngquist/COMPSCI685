Ohio (listen) is a state in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States. Of the fifty states, it is the 34th-largest by area, and with a population of nearly 11.7 million, is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated. Ohio is historically known as the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as "Buckeyes". The state takes its name from the Ohio River, whose name in turn originated from the Senatorca word ohiːyo', meaning "good river", "great river", or "large creek". Ohio's geographic location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. The climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb) throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's Bluegrass region section, which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and Upland South region of the United States. The highest recorded temperature was 113 °F (45 °C), near Gallipolis on July 21, 1934. The lowest recorded temperature was −39 °F (−39 °C), at Milligan on February 10, 1899, during the Great Blizzard of 1899. Archeological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 BC. Between 1,000 and 800 BC, the sedentary Adena culture emerged. Around 100 BC, the Adena evolved into the Hopewell people who were also mound builders. During the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region. On February 19, 1803, US president Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. From just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio's population grew faster than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the 1970 census, which recorded just over 10.65 million Ohioans. The largest groups were: Mexico (54,166), India (50,256), China (34,901), Germany (19,219), Philippines (16,410), United Kingdom (15,917), Canada (14,223), Russia (11,763), South Korea (11,307), and Ukraine (10,681). About 6.7% of the population age 5 years and older reported speaking a language other than English, with 2.2% of the population speaking Spanish, 2.6% speaking other Indo-European languages, 1.1% speaking Asian and Austronesian languages, and 0.8% speaking other languages. According to a Pew Forum poll, as of 2008, 76% of Ohioans identified as Christian. According to the US Census Bureau, the total number for employment in 2016 was 4,790,178. As of 2016, Ohio's gross domestic product (GDP) was $626 billion.
