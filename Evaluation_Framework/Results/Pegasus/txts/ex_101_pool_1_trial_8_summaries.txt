Washington ( (listen)), officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Washington was named after President George Washington by an act of the United States Congress during the creation of Washington Territory in 1853. A Mediterranean climate predominates in western Washington, and a much drier semi-arid climate prevails east of the Cascade Range. Forests cover about half the state's land area, mostly west of the North Cascades. The skeletal remains of Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most complete human remains found in North America, were discovered in Washington. Before the Europeans arrived, the region had many established tribes of aboriginal Americans, notable for their totem poles and their ornately carved canoes and masks. The smallpox epidemic of the 1770s devastated the Native American population. The first recorded European landing on the Washington coast was by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775, on board the Santiago, part of a two-ship flotilla with the Sonora. The British-Spanish Nootka Convention of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. A Washington State constitution was drafted and ratified in 1878, but it was never officially adopted. Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11, 1889. Early prominent industries in the state included agriculture and lumber. In eastern Washington, the Yakima River Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using dry farming techniques became particularly productive. The United States Census Bureau estimates Washington's population was 7,614,893 on July 1, 2019, a 13.24 percent increase since the 2010 Census. The five largest ancestry groups were: German (17.8%),Irish (10.8%), English (10.4%), Norwegian (5.4%), and American (4.6%). Additionally, Washington has a large Ethiopian community, with many Eritrean residents as well. In 2010, 82.51% (5,060,313) of Washington residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.79% (477,566) spoke Spanish, 1.19% (72,552) Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 0.94% (57,895) Vietnamese, 0.84% (51,301) Tagalog, 0.83% (50,757) Korean, 0.80% (49,282) Russian, and German, 0.55% (33,744). Washington has a relatively strong economy, with a total gross state product of $569.449 billion in 2018, placing it 10th in the nation and growing by 5.7 percent per yearâ€”the fastest rate in the United States. As of December 2018, the state's unemployment rate is 4.3 percent. The state of Washington is one of seven states that do not levy a personal income tax.
