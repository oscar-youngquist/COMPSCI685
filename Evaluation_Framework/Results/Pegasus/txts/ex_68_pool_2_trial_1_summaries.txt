The territory of modern Utah has been inhabited by various indigenous groups for thousands of years, including the ancient Puebloans, the Navajo and the Ute. The Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive in the mid-16th century, though the region's difficult geography and climate made it a peripheral part of New Spain and later Mexico. Young and the first band of Mormon pioneers reached the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. Beginning in 1865, Utah's Black Hawk War developed into the deadliest conflict in the territory's history. On May 10, 1869, the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed at Promontory Summit, north of the Great Salt Lake. Statehood was officially granted on January 4, 1896. Utah granted full voting rights to women in 1870, 26 years before becoming a state.
