GT:
Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in the world, being bordered by four of the five Great Lakes, plus Lake Saint Clair. Although Michigan developed a diverse economy, it is widely known as the center of the US automotive industry, which developed as a major economic force in the early 20th century. When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous tribes were Algonquian peoples, which include the Anishinaabe groups of Ojibwe (referred to as "Chippewa" in the United States), Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa), and the Boodewaadamii/Bod√©wadmi (Potawatomi). From 1660 until the end of French rule, Michigan was part of the Royal Province of New France. Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the American Revolution. Michigan received the western part of the Upper Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union as a free state on January 26, 1837. Railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward, with Detroit the chief hub. With the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United States, including both blacks and whites from the rural South. By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the US. Michigan converted much of its manufacturing to satisfy defense needs during World War II; it manufactured 10.9 percent of the United States military armaments produced during the war, ranking second (behind New York) among the 48 states. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Michigan saw the state suffer one of the largest death tolls in the United States with the metro Detroit area particularly hard hit. Michigan was the home of Gerald Ford, the 38th president of the United States. In 1846, Michigan became the first state in the Union, as well as the first government in the world, to abolish the death penalty. With 78 state parks, 19 state recreation areas, and six state forests, Michigan has the largest state park and state forest system of any state. Michigan is a leading grower of fruit in the US, including blueberries, tart cherries, apples, grapes, and peaches. Michigan music is known for three music trends: early punk rock, Motown/soul music and techno music. Michigan musicians include Bill Haley & His Comets, The Supremes, The Marvelettes, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye "The Prince of Soul", Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Aretha Franklin, Mary Wells, Tommy James and the Shondells, ? and the Mysterians, Al Green, The Spinners, Grand Funk Railroad, The Stooges, the MC5, The Knack, Madonna "The Queen of Pop", Bob Seger, Ray Parker Jr., Aaliyah, Eminem, Kid Rock, Jack White and Meg White (The White Stripes), Big Sean, Alice Cooper, and Del Shannon. Twenty-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams was born in Saginaw. Michigan is traditionally known as "The Wolverine State", and the University of Michigan takes the wolverine as its mascot.
