Between 8500 and 7000 BCE, at the time of the Champlain Sea, Native Americans inhabited and hunted in present-day Vermont. The first European to see Vermont is thought to have been French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1535. On July 30, 1609, French explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed this territory as part of New France. In 1666, French settlers erected Fort Sainte Anne on Isle La Motte, the first European settlement in Vermont. From 1731 to 1734, the French constructed Fort St. Frédéric, which gave them control of the New France–Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley. With the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, the North American front of the Seven Years' War between the French and British, the French began construction in 1755 of Fort Carillon at present-day Ticonderoga, New York. Following France's loss in the French and Indian War, through the 1763 Treaty of Paris, it ceded control of land east of the Mississippi River to the British. In 1775, after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the Green Mountain Boys assisted a force from Connecticut, led by Benedict Arnold, in capturing the British fort at Ticonderoga. On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of Vermont. On July 4, they completed the drafting of the Constitution of Vermont at the Windsor Tavern, and adopted it on July 8. The Battle of Hubbardton (July 7, 1777) was the only Revolutionary battle within the present boundaries of Vermont. Congress acted on February 18, 1791, to admit Vermont to the Union as the 14th state as of March 4, 1791. The revised constitution of 1786, which established a greater separation of powers, continued in effect until 1793, two years after Vermont's admission to the Union. From the mid-1850s on, some Vermonters became activists opposing slavery, which they had previously worked to contain in the South. In 1860 it voted for Abraham Lincoln, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state. From 1925 to 1928 the Eugenics Survey of Vermont conducted research and recorded the histories of families it determined were degenerate or dependent. In 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law. Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited suffrage. In 1964, the US Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. Sims required "one man, one vote" redistricting in all states. In 2009, Vermont became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage, unforced by court challenge or ruling.
