The first Europeans to explore the California coast were the members of a Spanish sailing expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo; they entered San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542, and reached at least as far north as San Miguel Island. Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco. In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico (including California) independence from Spain. As a result of Marsh's actions, they abandoned the fight, Micheltorena was defeated, and California-born Pio Pico was returned to the governorship. This paved the way to California's ultimate acquisition by the United States. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and 1928 St. Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in UShistory.
