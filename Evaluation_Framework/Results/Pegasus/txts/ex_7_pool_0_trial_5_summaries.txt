It is the fourth-largest state by area, the eighth-least populous state, and the third-least densely populated state. Montana has no official nickname but several unofficial ones, most notably "Big Sky Country", "The Treasure State", "Land of the Shining Mountains", and "The Last Best Place". The name Montana comes from the Spanish word monta√±a, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, meaning "mountain" or more broadly "mountainous country". Montana is one of few geographic areas in the world whose rivers form parts of three major watersheds (i.e. where two continental divides intersect). On January 3, 2012, the Census and Economic Information Center (CEIC) at the Montana Department of Commerce estimated Montana had hit the one million population mark sometime between November and December 2011.
