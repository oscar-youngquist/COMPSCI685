GT:
It is also known informally by its nickname, "The Sooner State", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which increased European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory. The name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw language phrase okla humma, literally meaning red people. Equivalent to the English word Indian, okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language that described Native American people as a whole. In the Chickasaw language, the state is known as Oklahomma', in Arapaho as bo'oobe' (literally meaning red earth), Pawnee: Uukuhuúwa, and Cayuga: Gahnawiyoˀgeh. Due to Oklahoma's location at the confluence of many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have a high rate of biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses.
