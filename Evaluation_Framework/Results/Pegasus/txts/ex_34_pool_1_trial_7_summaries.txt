GT:
Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth. When it was officially opened to settlement by the US government in 1854 with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as Bleeding Kansas. Before European colonization, Kansas was occupied by the Caddoan Wichita and later the Siouan Kaw people. Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into Spanish Louisiana. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the Republic of Texas until the conclusion of the Mexican–American War in 1848, when these lands were ceded to the United States. The Santa Fe Trail traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from Missouri and silver and furs from Santa Fe, New Mexico. In response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first US state to adopt a constitutional amendment prohibiting all alcoholic beverages, which was repealed in 1948. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually. Many African Americans in Kansas are descended from the Exodusters, newly freed blacks who fled the South for land in Kansas following the Civil War. Known as rural flight, the last few decades have been marked by a migratory pattern out of the countryside into cities. In Kansas alone, there are more than 6,000 ghost towns and dwindling communities, according to one Kansas historian, Daniel C. Fitzgerald. North of the city, Fort Leavenworth is the oldest active Army post west of the Mississippi River. Nearly 90% of Kansas's land is devoted to agriculture. The state's agricultural outputs are cattle, sheep, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, hogs, corn, and salt. By far, the most significant agricultural crop in the state is wheat. The industrial outputs are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, apparel, petroleum, and mining. Since the mid-20th century, Kansas has remained one of the most socially conservative states in the nation. Kansas has not elected a Democrat to the US Senatorte since the 1932 election, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won his first term as president in the wake of the Great Depression. The state anthem is the American classic Home on the Range, written by Kansan Brewster Higley.
