Most Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the 9-1-1 system. There are also counties in northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Indiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway. Indiana annually ships more than 70 million tons of cargo by water each year, which ranks 14th among all US states.
