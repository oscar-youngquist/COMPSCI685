How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
It is known as the "Constitution State", the "Nutmeg State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits". State law authorizes municipalities to tax property, including real estate, vehicles and other personal property, with state statute providing varying exemptions, credits and abatements. This plan combined the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senatortors ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's constitutional history. The governor heads the executive branch. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. The legislature is the General Assembly. Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. Locally elected representatives also develop Local ordinances to govern cities and towns. In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the state marshal system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines. The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions. The state is also divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns. Each region has an administrative body made up chief executive officers of the member towns.

Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The governor heads the executive branch. There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. The legislature is the General Assembly. The General Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of an upper body, the State Senatorte (36 senators); and a lower body, the House of Representatives (151 representatives). Bills must pass each house in order to become law. Locally elected representatives also develop Local ordinances to govern cities and towns. The highest court of Connecticut's judicial branch is the Connecticut Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. The Appellate Court is a lesser statewide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states. Connecticut does not have county government, unlike all other states except Rhode Island. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines. The eight counties are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as weather reports and census reporting. Connecticut shares with the rest of New England a governmental institution called the New England town. The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions. There are also 21 cities, most of which simply follow the boundaries of their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: the City of Groton, which is a subsection of the Town of Groton, and the City of Winsted in the Town of Winchester. There are also nine incorporated boroughs which may provide additional services to a section of town.
