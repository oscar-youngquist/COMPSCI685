Intent:
How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
It is known as the "Constitution State", the "Nutmeg State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits". This plan combined the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senatortors ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's constitutional history. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The governor heads the executive branch. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. The legislature is the General Assembly. Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senatortors and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines. The state is also divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns.

A constitution similar to the modern US Constitution was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. The governor heads the executive branch. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. The legislature is the General Assembly. The General Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of an upper body, the State Senatorte (36 senators); and a lower body, the House of Representatives (151 representatives). Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senatortors and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senatorte, except when absent from the chamber, when the President pro tempore presides. The Speaker of the House presides over the House. Connecticut has five representatives in the US House, all of whom are Democrats. Locally elected representatives also develop Local ordinances to govern cities and towns. The highest court of Connecticut's judicial branch is the Connecticut Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Connecticut does not have county government, unlike all other states except Rhode Island. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines. The state is also divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns.
