Those of English and Irish ancestry are present in large numbers in all the urban/suburban areas across the state. Like whites in most other states of the southern US, they descend mainly from English and Scots-Irish settlers, as well as some other British American settlers. Conversely, large numbers of northern whites moved to the state. Some sections of the state feature architectural styles including Spanish revival, Florida vernacular, and Mediterranean Revival.
