Input:
Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 19th-least populous, but the 9th-least densely populated of the US states. About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the US federal government, both civilian and military. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Nevada is the most mountainous state in the contiguous United States. The vegetation of Nevada is diverse and differs by state area. Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the US percentage-wise. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. Historically, northern Nevada has been very Republican. The more rural counties of the north are among the most conservative regions of the country. The Nevada state parks comprise protected areas managed by the state of Nevada, including state parks, state historic sites, and state recreation areas. The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations.
