Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee. It has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns. With a total area (land and water) of 36,418 square miles (94,320 km2), Indiana ranks as the 38th largest state in size. The state has a maximum dimension north to south of 250 miles (400 km) and a maximum east to west dimension of 145 miles (233 km). Located in the Midwestern United States, Indiana is one of eight states that make up the Great Lakes Region. The resulting elevation span, 937 feet (286 m), is the narrowest of any non-coastal US state. The state includes two natural regions of the United States: the Central Lowlands and the Interior Low Plateaus. Northern Indiana is similar, except for the presence of higher and hillier terminal moraines and hundreds of kettle lakes. These are along the Lake Michigan shoreline and also inland to the Kankakee Outwash Plain. Southern Indiana is characterized by valleys and rugged, hilly terrain, contrasting from much of the state. According to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, there were 65 rivers, streams, and creeks of environmental interest or scenic beauty, which included only a portion of an estimated 24,000 total river miles within the state. There are about 900 lakes listed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. As of 2010, the state includes 16 metropolitan and 25 micropolitan statistical areas, 117 incorporated cities, 450 towns, and several other smaller divisions and statistical areas. Since 2000, Fishers has seen the largest population rise amongst the state's twenty largest cities with an increase of 100 percent. Its proximity to large urban centers, such as Indianapolis and Chicago, assure dairying, egg production, and specialty horticulture occur.Other crops include melons, tomatoes, grapes, mint, popping corn, and tobacco in the southern counties. Many parcels of woodland remain and support a furniture-making sector in the southern portion of the state. Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Lawrence Seaway (via Lake Michigan) and the Inland Waterway System (via the Ohio River).

Located in the Midwestern United States, Indiana is one of eight states that make up the Great Lakes Region. Indiana is bordered on the north by Michigan, on the east by Ohio, and on the west by Illinois, partially separated by the Wabash River. Lake Michigan borders Indiana on the northwest and the Ohio River separates Indiana from Kentucky on the south. The state includes two natural regions of the United States: the Central Lowlands and the Interior Low Plateaus. The till plains make up the northern and central regions of Indiana. Much of its appearance is a result of elements left behind by glaciers. Central Indiana is mainly flat with some low rolling hills (except where rivers cut deep valleys through the plain, like at the Wabash River and Sugar Creek) and soil composed of glacial sands, gravel and clay, which results in exceptional farmland. Northern Indiana is similar, except for the presence of higher and hillier terminal moraines and hundreds of kettle lakes. In northwest Indiana there are various sand ridges and dunes, some reaching nearly 200 feet in height. These are along the Lake Michigan shoreline and also inland to the Kankakee Outwash Plain. Southern Indiana is characterized by valleys and rugged, hilly terrain, contrasting from much of the state. Here, bedrock is exposed at the surface and isn't buried in glacial till like further north. Because of the prevalent Indiana limestone, the area has many caves, caverns, and quarries. There are about 900 lakes listed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. To the northwest, Indiana borders Lake Michigan, one of five lakes comprising the Great Lakes, the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. Hispanic or Latino of any race made up 7.3% of the population. The Hispanic population is Indiana's fastest-growing ethnic minority. The study found 16 percent of Indiana is affiliated with no religion.
