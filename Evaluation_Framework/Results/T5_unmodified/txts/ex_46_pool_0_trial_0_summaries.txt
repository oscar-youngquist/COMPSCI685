Input:

The state continues to produce half of the nation's newly mined copper. Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors.
