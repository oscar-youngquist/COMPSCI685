What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy made the transition to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology, and green energy production. CNBC's list of "Top States for Business in 2010" has recognized Iowa as the sixth best state in the nation. If measured by gross state product, for 2005 it was $113.5 billion. Manufacturing is the largest sector of Iowa's economy, with $20.8 billion (21%) of Iowa's 2003 gross state product. Major manufacturing sectors include food processing, heavy machinery, and agricultural chemicals. Though industrial-scale, commodity agriculture predominates in much of the state, Iowa has seen growth in the organic farming sector. As of 2007, the direct production and sale of conventional agricultural commodities contributed only about 3.5% of Iowa's gross state product. In 2008, the 92,600 farms in Iowa produced 19% of the nation's corn, 17% of the soybeans, 30% of the hogs, and 14% of the eggs.
