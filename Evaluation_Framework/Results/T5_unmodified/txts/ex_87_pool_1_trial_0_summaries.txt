What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the US federal government, both civilian and military. The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer, with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world. Mining shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see Silver mining in Nevada). Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the US percentage-wise. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent. The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching. Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high, and output is very sensitive to world commodity prices. Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada.

Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment. The economy of Nevada has long been tied to vice industries. "[Nevada was] founded on mining and refounded on sin â€“ beginning with prizefighting and easy divorce a century ago and later extending to gaming and prostitution", said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. By value, gold is by far the most important mineral mined. In 2004, 6,800,000 ounces (190,000,000 g) of gold worth $2.84 billion were mined in Nevada, and the state accounted for 8.7% of world gold production (see Gold mining in Nevada). Silver is a distant second, with 10,300,000 ounces (290,000,000 g) worth $69 million mined in 2004 (see Silver mining in Nevada). Other minerals mined in Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite and lithium. Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada. Nevada's agricultural outputs are cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions, and potatoes.
