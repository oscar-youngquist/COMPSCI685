Input:
It borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. The state's north, the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle, is closely linked with Eastern Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zoneâ€”the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone. Industries significant for the state economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism. The official state nickname is the "Gem State", which references Idaho's natural beauty. The states of Washington and Oregon are to the west, Nevada and Utah are to the south, and Montana and Wyoming are to the east. The state has snow-capped mountain ranges, rapids, vast lakes and steep canyons. The new territory included present-day Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming. In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries. Other metropolitan areas in order of size are Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Falls, Pocatello and Lewiston. All three varieties of wheat, dark northern spring, hard red, and soft white are grown in the state. In keeping with this, while there are no large wineries or breweries in Idaho, there are numerous and growing numbers of award-winning boutique wineries and microbreweries in the northern part of the state. A number of Fortune 500 companies started in or trace their roots to Idaho, including Safeway in American Falls, Albertsons in Boise, JR Simplot across southern Idaho, and Potlatch Corp. in Lewiston. In 2014, Idaho emerged as the second most small business friendly state, ranking behind Utah, based on a study drawing upon data from more than 12,000 small business owners.
