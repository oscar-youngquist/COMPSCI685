Input:
The state's close proximity to the ocean influences many aspects of Florida culture and daily life. This is the third-most diverse state in the union, behind California and Texas, both larger states. Most of this is in Bone Valley. Many of these were of English or Scotch-Irish descent; however, their families have lived in the state for so long they choose to identify as having "American" ancestry or do not know their ancestry. Those of English and Irish ancestry are present in large numbers in all the urban/suburban areas across the state. Like whites in most other states of the southern US, they descend mainly from English and Scots-Irish settlers, as well as some other British American settlers. Conversely, large numbers of northern whites moved to the state. Some sections of the state feature architectural styles including Spanish revival, Florida vernacular, and Mediterranean Revival.
