Jackson is both the state's capital and largest city. The state's name is derived from the Mississippi River, which flows along and defines its western boundary. Mississippi is bordered to the north by Tennessee, to the east by Alabama, to the south by Louisiana and a narrow coast on the Gulf of Mexico; and to the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and Arkansas. (See: Lists of cities, towns and villages, census-designated places, metropolitan areas, micropolitan areas, and counties in Mississippi) Two bands of historical prairie, the Jackson Prairie and the Black Belt, run northwest to southeast in the middle and northeastern part of the state. Plantations were developed primarily along the major rivers, where the waterfront provided access to the major transportation routes. They also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors. Mississippi has six airports with commercial passenger service, the busiest in Jackson (Jackson-Evers International Airport) and one in Gulfport (Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport) Mississippi is served by nine interstate highways: Routes: as well as a system of State Highways. Amtrak provides scheduled passenger service along two routes, the Crescent and City of New Orleans.
