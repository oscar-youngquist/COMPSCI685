It still has a substantial presence in the state. The state's attractiveness as a corporate haven is largely because of its business-friendly corporation law. This was a successor to the Del-Mar-Va Express and Cavalier, which had run from Philadelphia through the state's interior, to the end of the Delmarva Peninsula until the mid-1950s. Gambling provides significant revenue to the state.
