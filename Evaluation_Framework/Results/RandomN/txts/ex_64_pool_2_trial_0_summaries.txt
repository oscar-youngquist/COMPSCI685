What are the major historical events in this state?
\Predicted Summary:
The explosion in the number of high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural water contamination and a decline in air quality. Primarily, they were families from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia who settled along the western banks of the Mississippi River, founding the modern day cities of Dubuque and Bellevue. Senatortors: On July 2, 2009, Standard & Poor's rated the state of Iowa's credit as AAA (the highest of its credit ratings, held by only 11 US state governments). Former WWE Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins is from Davenport. RAGBRAI, the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa, attracts thousands of bicyclists and support personnel. Notable writers, artists, and news personalities from Iowa include Bill Bryson, George Gallup, Susan Glaspell, Mauricio Lasansky, Tomas Lasansky, Harry Reasoner, and Grant Wood. While Iowa is often viewed as a farming state, agriculture is a relatively small portion of the state's diversified economy, with manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services contributing substantially to Iowa's economy. Beginning with the first industries developed in the 1830s, which were mainly for processing materials grown in the area, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations. Iowa is among the few jurisdictions where municipalities install speed cameras on interstate highways providing a substantial revenue source from out of state drivers. King represented the old fifth congressional district. Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in State of Iowa v. Katz that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when Edna Griffin was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore.

The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763. In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte took control of Louisiana from Spain in a treaty. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two partsâ€”the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter. The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833. On July 4, 1838, the US Congress established the Territory of Iowa. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln, though there was an antiwar "Copperhead" movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The farm crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression.
