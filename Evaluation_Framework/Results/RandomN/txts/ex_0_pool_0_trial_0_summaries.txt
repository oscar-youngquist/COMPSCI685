What is the state's policy regarding education?
\Predicted Summary:
Since 1946, statewide elected constitutional officers have been elected to four-year terms. Tax is collected by the Idaho State Tax Commission. Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in North Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon. Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well into the 20th century repeated as fact Willing's account the name "Idaho" derived from the Shoshone term "ee-da-how". To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia. Science and technology have become the largest single economic center (over 25% of the state's total revenue) within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined. Walt Minnick's 2008 win in the First Congressional District was the state's first Democratic Congressional victory in 16 years. The Boise metropolitan area (officially known as the Boise City-Nampa, ID Metropolitan Statistical Area) is Idaho's largest metropolitan area.
