What is the state's policy regarding education?
\Predicted Summary:
It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and it shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur). However, using the official measure the poverty rate was only 13.3% as of 2017. In 2008, California exported $144 billion worth of goods, up from $134 billion in 2007 and $127 billion in 2006.Computers and electronic products are California's top export, accounting for 42 percent of all the state's exports in 2008. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. So it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban. After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh became involved in a military battle between the much-hated Mexican general, Manuel Micheltorena and the California governor he had replaced, Juan Bautista Alvarado. The Colorado River forms the state's southeast border with Arizona. In 2008, those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population.

GT:
The state government also adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education. Public secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K–12 and community colleges that grow with the economy and student enrollment figures. In 2016, California's K–12 public school per-pupil spending was ranked 22nd in the nation ($11,500 per student vs. $11,800 for the US average). California's public postsecondary education offers three separate systems: The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards. About 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California's public education. California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts.
