What are some of the most interesting things about this state?
\Predicted Summary:
With its rapid growth in industry, it was an important center of industry-wide union organizing, such as the rise of the United Auto Workers. In a few locations, municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the establishment of district courts. France offered free land to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765, and was the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans. Michigan remained fairly reliably Republican at the presidential level for much of the 20th century. It is home to the country's three major automobile companies (whose headquarters are all in Metro Detroit). Occasionally U.P. Michigan is home to the largest mosque in North America, the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847, respectively. The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Michigan was 9,986,857 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 1.04% from 9,883,635 recorded at the 2010 United States Census. In 2011, the state repealed its business tax and replaced it with a 6% corporate income tax which substantially reduced taxes on business. Michigan sugar brand names are Pioneer Sugar and the newly incorporated Big Chief Sugar. The Detroit Tigers played at Tiger Stadium (formerly known as Navin Field and Briggs Stadium) from 1912 to 1999. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers. District courts are trial courts of limited jurisdiction, handling most traffic violations, small claims, misdemeanors, and civil suits where the amount contended is below $25,000. The new route attracted a large influx of settlers to the Michigan territory. Michigan has about 150 lighthouses, the most of any US state.

Michigan ( (listen)) is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. Michigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas. When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous tribes were Algonquian peoples, which include the Anishinaabe groups of Ojibwe (referred to as "Chippewa" in the United States), Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa), and the Boodewaadamii/Bod√©wadmi (Potawatomi). Michigan's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. With the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United States, including both blacks and whites from the rural South. By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the US. Since 1838, the city has been noted for its furniture industry. In 1927 a school bombing took place in Clinton County. Michigan is the leading auto-producing state in the US, with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States; Ontario, Canada; and the Southern United States. With almost ten million residents, Michigan is a large and influential state, ranking tenth in population among the fifty states. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Michigan saw the state suffer one of the largest death tolls in the United States with the metro Detroit area particularly hard hit. Michigan is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: the executive branch consisting of the Governor of Michigan and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the House of Representatives and Senatorte; and the judicial branch. Michigan remained fairly reliably Republican at the presidential level for much of the 20th century. In 1846, Michigan became the first state in the Union, as well as the first government in the world, to abolish the death penalty. Home rule cities can generally do anything not prohibited by law. The Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. The state has numerous large islands, the principal ones being the North Manitou and South Manitou, Beaver, and Fox groups in Lake Michigan; Isle Royale and Grande Isle in Lake Superior; Marquette, Bois Blanc, and Mackinac islands in Lake Huron; and Neebish, Sugar, and Drummond islands in St. Mary's River. Michigan has about 150 lighthouses, the most of any US state.
