North Dakota expanded Medicaid in 2014, and its health insurance exchange is the federal site, HealthCare.gov. Municipal courts serve the cities, and most cases start in the district courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. Williston is near the confluence of the Missouri River and the Yellowstone River near Montana. Western North Dakota saw a boom in oil exploration in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as rising petroleum prices made development profitable. The primary historic tribal nations in or around North Dakota, are the Lakota and the Dakota ("The Great Sioux Nation" or "Oceti Sakowin", meaning the seven council fires), the Blackfoot, the Cheyenne, the Chippewa (known as Ojibwe in Canada), and the Mandan. Many of the state's merchants also rely on agriculture. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions. Minot is a city in northern North Dakota and is home of the North Dakota State Fair and Norsk HÃ¸stfest.

But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions.
