What are some of the most interesting things about this state?
\Predicted Summary:
While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, progress has been very slow, mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416 lost their lives and over 50,000 more were wounded. Indiana is within the US Corn Belt and Grain Belt. The three other independent state universities are Vincennes University (Founded in 1801 by the Indiana Territory), Ball State University (1918) and University of Southern Indiana (1965 as ISU – Evansville). The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana, such as the decline of urbanization. The Woodland period began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties). Professional basketball player Larry Bird was born in West Baden Springs and was raised in French Lick. The Ports of Indiana manages three major ports which include Burns Harbor, Jeffersonville, and Mount Vernon. He remains the only President from Indiana. It also can oversee the activities of the executive branch of the state government, has restricted power to regulate the county governments within the state, and has exclusive power to initiate the method to alter the Indiana Constitution. Evansville has been a US Customs Port of Entry for more than 125 years. On several occasions, he declared martial law to put an end to worker strikes. Northern Indiana is similar, except for the presence of higher and hillier terminal moraines and hundreds of kettle lakes. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking Evansville to Martinsville) now complete. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of Union Literary Institute and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves. Indiana was formerly home to two major military installations; Grissom Air Force Base near Peru (realigned to an Air Force Reserve installation in 1994) and Fort Benjamin Harrison near Indianapolis, now closed, though the Department of Defense continues to operate a large finance center there (Defense Finance and Accounting Service). Clark's army won significant battles and took over Vincennes and Fort Sackville on February 25, 1779. Not until 1988 did another presidential election involve a native of Indiana, when Senatortor Dan Quayle was elected vice president and served one term with George H W Bush. In midwinter, average high/low temperatures range from around 30 °F/15 °F (−1 °C/−10 °C) in the far north to 41 °F/24 °F (5 °C/−4 °C) in the far south.

The first inhabitants in what is now Indiana were the Paleo-Indians, who arrived about 8000 BCE after the melting of the glaciers at the end of the Ice Age. Divided into small groups, the Paleo-Indians were nomads who hunted large game such as mastodons. They created stone tools made out of chert by chipping, knapping and flaking. Indiana is one of 13 US states that are divided into more than one time zone. Indiana's time zones have fluctuated over the past century. At present most of the state observes Eastern Time Debate continues on the matter. From 1880 to 1924, a resident of Indiana was included in all but one presidential election. Indiana Representative William Hayden English was nominated for vice president and ran with Winfield Scott Hancock in the 1880 election. Indiana has an extensive history with auto racing. Indianapolis hosts the Indianapolis 500 mile race over Memorial Day weekend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway every May. The name of the race is usually shortened to "Indy 500" and also goes by the nickname "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing". As of 2013 Indiana has produced more National Basketball Association (NBA) players per capita than any other state. Muncie has produced the most per capita of any American city, with two other Indiana cities in the top ten. In 2016, Indiana was home to seven Fortune 500 companies with a combined $142.5 billion in revenue. Columbus-based Cummins, Inc. and Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Company and Simon Property Group were recognized in Fortune publication's "2017 World's Most Admired Companies List", ranking in each of their respective industries. Indiana's 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state-funded public school system. It also allotted one township for a public university. However, the plan turned out to be far too idealistic for a pioneer society, as tax money was not accessible for its organization.
