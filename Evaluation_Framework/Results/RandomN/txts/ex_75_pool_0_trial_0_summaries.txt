What are some of the most interesting things about this state?
\Predicted Summary:
The border between the lowcountry and the upcountry is defined by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line, which marks the limit of navigable rivers. Cotton became an important crop after the invention of the cotton gin. Other South Carolinians, like Senator Strom Thurmond, on the other hand, were among the nation's most radical and effective opponents of social equality and integration. This tranquil transition from a Jim Crow society occurred because the state's white and black leaders were willing to accept slow change rather than being utterly unwilling to accept change at all. There is evidence of human activity in the area dating to about 40,000 years ago. South Carolina was one of the first states to stop paying for 'early elective' deliveries of babies, under either Medicaid and private insurance. As of 2010, South Carolina is the American state with the highest per capita proportion of citizens who follow the Baháʼí Faith, with 17,559 adherents, making Baháʼí the second-largest religion in the state. While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state, the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer, while inland, the spring and autumn transitions tend to be the wettest periods and winter the driest season, with November being the driest month. Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the Wars of Religion. College teams represent their particular South Carolina institutions, and are the primary options for football, basketball and baseball attendance in the state. The fall line was an important early source of water power. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century; and created tourism industries. The Atlantic Coastal Plain consists of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present. In the summer, South Carolina is hot and humid, with daytime temperatures averaging between 86–93 °F (30–34 °C) in most of the state and overnight lows averaging 70–75 °F (21–24 °C) on the coast and from 66–73 °F (19–23 °C) inland. The Greenville–Anderson–Mauldin metropolitan area is the largest in the state, with a 2018 population estimate of 906,626. South Carolina has banned sanctuary cities. South Carolina averages around 50 days of thunderstorm activity a year. The Crescent route serves the Upstate cities, the Silver Star serves the Midlands cities, and the Palmetto and Silver Meteor routes serve the lowcountry cities.

South Carolina ( (listen)) is a state in the Deep South region of the Southern United States. South Carolina is the 40th most extensive and 23rd most populous US state. South Carolina was named in honor of King Charles I of England, who first formed the English colony, with Carolus being Latin for "Charles". The state can be divided into three natural geographic areas which then can be subdivided into five distinct cultural regions. South Carolina has several major lakes covering over 683 square miles (1,770 km2). South Carolina averages 10–15 earthquakes a year below magnitude 3 (FEMA). South Carolina has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), although high-elevation areas in the Upstate area have fewer subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline. South Carolina is also prone to tropical cyclones and tornadoes. The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October, during the Cape Verde hurricane season. The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of South Carolina was 5,148,714 on July 1, 2019, an 11.31 percentage increase since the 2010 census. As of the 2017 census estimate, the racial make up of the state is 68.5% White (63.8% non-Hispanic white), 27.3% Black or African American, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.7% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 1.9% from two or more races. There is evidence of human activity in the area dating to about 40,000 years ago. At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end of the Pre-Columbian era around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba, with the total population being up to 20,000. The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States. By the second half of the 1700s, South Carolina was one of the richest of the Thirteen Colonies. In February, 1778, South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, the initial governing document of the United States, and in May 1788, South Carolina ratified the United States Constitution, becoming the eighth state to enter the union. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA), in 2010, the largest religion is Christianity, of which the largest denominations were the Southern Baptist Convention with 913,763 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 274,111 adherents, and the Roman Catholic Church with 181,743 adherents. In 2019, South Carolina's GDP was $249.9 billion, making the state the 26th largest by GDP in the United States.
