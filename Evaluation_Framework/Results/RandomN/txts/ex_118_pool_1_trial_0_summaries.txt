What are some of the most interesting things about this state?
\Predicted Summary:
Increasing from 2010 and 2014's census information, Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 5.1% of Louisiana's population in 2018. Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in state-owned waters. The most populous city is New Orleans. The 1868 constitution, passed during the Reconstruction era before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and Diocese of Baton Rouge are the largest Catholic jurisdictions in the state, located within the Greater New Orleans and Greater Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical areas. Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. Tulane is also highly regarded for its academics nationwide, consistently ranked in the top 50 on US News & World Report's list of best national universities. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a covenant marriage. By 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state. In 2018, it was estimated that four percent of Louisianans are immigrants, while another four percent were native-born US citizens with at least one immigrant parent. The current Louisiana governor is Democrat John Bel Edwards.

Louisiana is the only US state with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are equivalent to counties. The state's capital is Baton Rouge, and its largest city is New Orleans. Much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural, multilingual heritage, being so strongly influenced by a mixture of 18th-century French, Italian, Haitian, Spanish, French Canadian, Native American, and African cultures that they are considered to be exceptional in the US Before the American purchase of the territory in 1803, the present-day State of Louisiana had been both a French colony and for a brief period a Spanish one. The state may properly be divided into two parts, the uplands of the north, and the alluvial along the coast. The state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately 3-mile (4.8 km)-wide portion of subsea land of the inner continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Through a peculiarity of the political geography of the United States, this is substantially less than the 9-mile (14 km)-wide jurisdiction of nearby states Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have extensive Gulf coastlines. Louisiana contains 308 incorporated municipalities, consisting of four consolidated city-parishes, and 304 cities, towns, and villages. Christians make up 84% of the total state population, making Louisiana one of the most Christian-dominated states in the United States. The Port of South Louisiana, located on the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, was the largest volume shipping port in the Western Hemisphere and 4th largest in the world, as well as the largest bulk cargo port in the US in 2004. Louisiana is rich in petroleum and natural gas. Louisiana is home to many, especially notable are the distinct culture of the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of color, descendants of free mixed-race families of the colonial and early statehood periods.
