Except for areas near the New York Harbor and the Upper Delaware River, New York has a mostly land border with two Mid-Atlantic states, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It divides the state into ten economic regions, which approximately correspond to terminology used by residents: New York has many state parks and two major forest preserves. The state operates numerous campgrounds, and there are over 300 miles (480 km) of multi-use trails in the Park. The southern Finger Lakes hillsides, the Hudson Valley, the North Fork of Long Island, and the southern shore of Lake Erie are the primary grape- and wine-growing regions in New York, with many vineyards. Downstate regions (Hudson Valley, New York City, and Long Island) consumed 66% of that amount. Upstate regions produced 50% of that amount.
