It provides for three branches of government: the legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The legislative branch consists of two bodies: the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. The House of Representatives has 163 members apportioned based on the last decennial census. The Senatorte consists of 34 members from districts of approximately equal populations.
