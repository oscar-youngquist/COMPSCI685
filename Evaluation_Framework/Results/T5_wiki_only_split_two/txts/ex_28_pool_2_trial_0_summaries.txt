Of the fifty states, it is the 34th-largest by area, and with a population of nearly 11.7 million, is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated. Ohio's geographic location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly all of the river itself belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia. The rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the northern Atlantic Ocean via Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence River, and the rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio River and then the Mississippi. However, other Ohio cities function as economic and cultural centers of metropolitan areas. It encompassed what became Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota. The industry of Ohio made the state one of the most important states in the Union during the Civil war. This ranks Ohio's economy as the seventh-largest of all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Ohio has the third largest manufacturing workforce behind California and Texas. Ohio has the largest bioscience sector in the Midwest, and is a national leader in the "green" economy. Ohio is the largest producer in the country of plastics, rubber, fabricated metals, electrical equipment, and appliances. Ohio's manufacturing sector is the third-largest of all fifty United States states in terms of gross domestic product. Additionally, Ohio is considered a bellwether. Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found in other states. Ohio schools consistently ranking in the top 50 nationally of the US News & World Report of liberal arts colleges are Kenyon College, Oberlin College, and Denison University. Ohio is home to some of the nation's highest-ranked public libraries. For 2008, 31 of Ohio's library systems were all ranked in the top ten for American cities of their population category.

For instance, some trees with more southern ranges, such as the blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), Crape Myrtle, and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's common wall lizard, one of the few examples of permanent "subtropical" fauna in Ohio. As of 2016, Ohio's gross domestic product (GDP) was $626 billion. This ranks Ohio's economy as the seventh-largest of all fifty states and the District of Columbia.

OPLIN also provides Ohioans with free home access to high-quality, subscription research databases. Ohio also offers the OhioLINK program, allowing Ohio's libraries (particularly those from colleges and universities) access to materials for the other libraries.
