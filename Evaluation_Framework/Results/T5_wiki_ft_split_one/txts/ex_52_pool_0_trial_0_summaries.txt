Input:
American Indians of the Paiute, Shoshone, and Washoe tribes inhabited what is now Nevada. Before that, it was a part of Arizona Territory. Mining booms drew many Greek and Eastern European immigrants to Nevada. People in these rural counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state. Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada. The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. Resort areas like Las Vegas, Reno, Lake Tahoe, and Laughlin attract visitors from around the nation and world.
