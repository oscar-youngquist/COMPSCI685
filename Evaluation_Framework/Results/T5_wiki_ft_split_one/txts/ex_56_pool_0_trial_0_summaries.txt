Vermont is the second-least-populated US state and the sixth-smallest by area of the 50 US states. The geography of the state is marked by the Green Mountains, which run north–south up the middle of the state, separating Lake Champlain and other valley terrain on the west from the Connecticut River valley that defines much of its eastern border. A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. It is the only landlocked state in New England, and it is the easternmost and the smallest in area of all landlocked states. Its metropolitan area is also the most populous in the state, with an estimate of 218,395 as of 2017. There are five distinct physiographic regions of Vermont. Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern Highlands, the Green Mountains, the Taconic Mountains, the Champlain Lowlands, and the Vermont Piedmont. The state contains 41 species of reptiles and amphibians, 89 species of fish, of which 12 are non native; 193 species of breeding birds, 58 species of mammals, more than 15,000 insect species, and 2,000 higher plant species, plus fungi, algae, and 75 different types of natural communities. Vermont is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. Much of the state, in particular the Green Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% in the 1880s, when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing. Most of these are towns. Twelve of the state's 14 counties stood in the top 20%. Vermont is one of four states that were once independent nations (Texas, California, and Hawaii are the others).
\Predicted Summary:

GT:
The Green Mountains in Vermont form a north–south spine running most of the length of the state, slightly west of its center. In the southwest portion of the state are located the Taconic Mountains. In the northwest, near Lake Champlain, is the fertile Champlain Valley. In the south of the valley is Lake Bomoseen. Several mountains have timberlines with delicate year-round alpine ecosystems, including Mount Mansfield, the highest mountain in the state; Killington Peak, the second-highest; Camel's Hump, the state's third-highest; and Mount Abraham, the fifth-highest peak. Areas in Vermont administered by the National Park Service include the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park (in Woodstock) and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Much of the state, in particular the Green Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The western border with New York and the area around Lake Champlain lies within the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests. The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak. In the 21st century, Protestants (30%) and Catholics (22%) make up the majority of those reporting a religious preference, with 37% reporting no religion, the highest rate of irreligion of all states. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological succession. The state and non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% in the 1880s, when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing. For lack of demand, Vermont's forests are growing twice as fast as they are being cut. As of October 2019, the unemployment rate was 2.2%. Historically, Vermont was considered one of the most reliably Republican states in the country in terms of national elections. In 2010, Vermont was the sixth highest ranked state for Well-Being in a study by Gallup and Healthways. In 2010, Vermont was ranked the highest in the country for health outcomes. In 2008, Vermont was ranked number one in the nation as the healthiest place to live for the seventh time in eight years. In 2009, Vermont was ranked second in the nation for safety.
