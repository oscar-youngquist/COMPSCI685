Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California. In 2010, Site Selection Magazine ranked Texas as the most business-friendly state in the nation, in part because of the state's three-billion-dollar Texas Enterprise Fund.

Causes of the state's poor rankings include politics, a high poverty rate, and the highest rate of illegal immigration in the nation. Texas's population density is 90.5 people per square mile (34.9/km2) which is slightly higher than the average population density of the US as a whole, at 80.6 people per square mile (31.1/km2). Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio consistently lean Democratic in both local and statewide elections. Early Texas settler David B. Edwards described his fellow Texans as being "banished from the pleasures of life". Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. Native Americans made up 0.5 percent of Texas's population and number over 118,000 individuals as of 2015. In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested power back in the state legislature from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction.
