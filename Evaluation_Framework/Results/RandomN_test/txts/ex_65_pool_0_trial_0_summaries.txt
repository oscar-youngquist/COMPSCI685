Input:
In the 21st century, its economy is based on service industries, aircraft, poultry, steel, and tourism, along with important commodity crops of cotton, soybeans and rice. Plantation agriculture set the state and region behind the nation for decades. Once a state with a cashless society in the uplands and plantation agriculture in the lowlands, Arkansas's economy has evolved and diversified. Six Fortune 500 companies are based in Arkansas, including the world's #1 retailer, Walmart; Tyson Foods, J.B. Hunt, Dillard's, Murphy USA, and Windstream are also headquartered in the state. The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. According to CNBC, Arkansas ranks as the 20th best state for business, with the 2nd-lowest cost of doing business, 5th-lowest cost of living, 11th best workforce, 20th-best economic climate, 28th-best educated workforce, 31st-best infrastructure and the 32nd-friendliest regulatory environment. Today only about three percent of the population are employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking 13th in the nation in the value of products sold. Arkansas is the nation's largest producer of rice, broilers, and turkeys, and ranks in the top three for cotton, pullets, and aquaculture (catfish). Automobile parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. Freight railroads are concentrated in southeast Arkansas to serve the industries in the region.
\Predicted Summary:
They were seeking better conditions of payment and accounting from white landowners of the area cotton plantations. The starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from natives, immediately started butchering the hogs and later, commanded by former aide-de-camp Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. Black sharecroppers began to try to organize a farmers' union after World War I. The governor of Arkansas is Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, who was inaugurated on January 13, 2015. The Arkansas is fed by the Mulberry and Fourche LaFave Rivers in the Arkansas River Valley, which is also home to Lake Dardanelle. In 1881, the state legislature defined the official pronunciation of Arkansas as having the final "s" be silent (as it would be in French). European Americans have a strong presence in the northwestern Ozarks and the central part of the state. The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the Illinois tribe's name for the Quapaw people, who lived downriver from them. Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the National Park System. The capital was relocated from Arkansas Post to Little Rock in 1821, during the territorial period.
