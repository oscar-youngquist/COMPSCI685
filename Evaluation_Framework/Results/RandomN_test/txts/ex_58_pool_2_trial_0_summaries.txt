With over 39.3 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous US state and the third-largest by area, as well as the world's thirty-fourth-most-populous subnational entity. California is also the most populated subnational entity in North America, and has its state capital in Sacramento. California's economy, with a gross state product of $3.2 trillion as of 2019, is the largest sub-national economy in the world. Although it accounts for only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any US state. The state's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center. California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. The Agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce. Many coastal cities include some of the wealthiest per-capita areas in the United States. Because it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. However because of its high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities.
\Predicted Summary:
Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco. The brown haze known as "smog" has been substantially abated after the passage of federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust. The California Gold Rush of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California's economic style, which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts. In 1849, a state Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists. Eleven butterflies are also endangered and two that are threatened are on the federal list. It is considered the origin of the hippie counterculture, beach and car culture, the Internet, and the personal computer, among others. In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the jackrabbit, kangaroo rat, squirrel, and opossum. Most small cities have a council–manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850–1851). The Tehachapi area is also where the Tehachapi Energy Storage Project is located. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769. This variety, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from varieties of AmericanEnglish used in other regions of the United States. The Port of Oakland, fourth largest in the nation, also handles trade entering from the Pacific Rim to the rest of the country.

California is a state in the Pacific Region of the United States. With over 39.3 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous US state and the third-largest by area, as well as the world's thirty-fourth-most-populous subnational entity. California is also the most populated subnational entity in North America, and has its state capital in Sacramento. The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second- and fifth-most-populous urban regions, with more than 18.7 million and 9.6 million residents respectively. California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas. The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast. California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the Nearctic realm and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions. The culture of California is a Western culture and most clearly has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences. Hollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the US film industry's "Big Five" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) being based in or around the area. The four major American television broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC) all have production facilities and offices in the state. California has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. The San Francisco Bay Area has six major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, while the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises. San Diego and Sacramento each have one major league team. California's economy ranks among the largest in the world.
