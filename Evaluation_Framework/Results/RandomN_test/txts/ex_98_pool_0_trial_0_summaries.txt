What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
The Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing. Other important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. Rhode Island's 2000 total gross state production was $46.18 billion (adjusted to inflation), placing it 45th in the nation. Additionally, Rhode Island is rated as the 5th most energy efficient state in the country. Health services are Rhode Island's largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism-related sales at $4.56 billion (adjusted to inflation) in the year 2000. The third-largest industry is manufacturing. Its industrial outputs are submarine construction, shipbuilding, costume jewelry, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, machinery, and boatbuilding. Rhode Island's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs.
\Predicted Summary:
The official state drink of Rhode Island is coffee milk, a beverage created by mixing milk with coffee syrup. The United States Naval Academy moved to Rhode Island temporarily during the war. The now-defunct professional football team the Providence Steam Roller won the 1928 NFL title. Private ferry services also link several Rhode Island communities with ports in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. Bousquet has also collaborated with humorist and Providence Journal columnist Mark Patinkin on two books: The Rhode Island Dictionary and The Rhode Island Handbook. The exceptions were East Greenwich, West Greenwich, and Scituate. Former Governor Donald Carcieri claimed that the higher tax rate had an inhibitory effect on business growth in the state and called for reductions to increase the competitiveness of the state's business environment. The team won the Calder Cup in 1938, 1940, 1949, and 1956. Rhode Islanders sometimes refer to drinking fountains as "bubblers", milkshakes as "cabinets", and overstuffed foot-long sandwiches (of whatever kind) as "grinders". Some Rhode Islanders speak with the distinctive, non-rhotic, traditional Rhode Island accent that many compare to a cross between the New York City and Boston accents (e.g., "water" sounds like "watuh" [ˈwɔəɾə]). This has since reduced to 10.5% in September 2020 and is projected to further decrease to 7% in October 2020.

GT:
The Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in textiles. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power that it once had. Other important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial history is the number of abandoned factories, many of them now being used for condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. Per the 2013 American Communities Survey, Rhode Island has the highest paid elementary school teachers in the country, with an average salary of $75,028 (adjusted to inflation). The headquarters of Citizens Financial Group is located in Providence, the 14th largest bank in the United States. The Fortune 500 companies CVS Caremark and Textron are based in Woonsocket and Providence, respectively.
