West Virginia is the 41st-largest state by area and ranks 38th in population, with around 1.791 million residents. The unique position of West Virginia means it is often included in several US geographical regions, including the Mid-Atlantic, the Upland South, and the Southeastern United States. The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant logging and coal mining industries, and its political and labor history. Located in the Appalachian Mountain range, West Virginia covers an area of 24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km2), with 24,077.73 square miles (62,361.0 km2) of land and 152.03 square miles (393.8 km2) of water, making it the 41st-largest state in the United States. West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi ("Mountaineers are always free"). About 75% of the state is within the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions. Most of West Virginia lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion, while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. The native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak, chestnut, maple, beech, and white pine, with willow and American sycamore along the state's waterways. It is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state. The state's Northern Panhandle, and North-Central region feel an affinity for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Finally, the towns and farms along the mid-Ohio River, which forms most of the state's western border, have an appearance and culture somewhat resembling the Midwest. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 2014 West Virginia's economy grew twice as fast as the next fastest growing state east of the Mississippi River, ranking third alongside Wyoming and just behind North Dakota and Texas among the fastest growing states in the United States. In addition to such outdoor recreation opportunities, the state offers a number of historic and cultural attractions. One of the major resources in West Virginia's economy is coal. According to the Energy Information Administration, West Virginia is a top coal-producer in the United States, second only to Wyoming. West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the Nation in net interstate electricity exports. Farming is also practiced in West Virginia, but on a limited basis because of the mountainous terrain over much of the state. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. This is expected to also help bring economic growth to the southern half of the state.
\Predicted Summary:
Former West Virginia governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land "as a farmer knows a field". Wisconsin Population Health Institute annual "Health Rankings" for 2012 showed West Virginia spends $9,671 per capita on health care annually. The interstates are supplemented by roads constructed under the Appalachian Corridor system. Hyman, was originally opened to the public on May 7, 1928, and hosts a variety of performing arts and music attractions. The governor, elected every four years on the same day as the US presidential election, is sworn in during the following January. The composition of the General Assembly was changed. The largest private employers in West Virginia, as of March 2019, were: Almost immediately after that vote, a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861. People of English ancestry are present throughout the entire state. The primary beneficiaries of the property tax are county boards of education. West Virginia ranked 49th in the 2014 State New Economy Index, and has ranked in the bottom three states since 1999. The 80-year-old Fort Steuben Bridge (Weirton-Steubenville Bridge) was permanently closed on January 8, 2009. It extended the vote to all white males 21 years or older. This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years a specific portion of the C & O Railroad carried limestone rock to Clifton Forge, Virginia as an industrial flux. All but Charleston and Huntington are subsidized by the federal Department of Transportation's Essential Air Service program. However, in the second half of the 19th century, there was an even greater treasure not yet developed: bituminous coal. Many old tracks have been converted to rail trails for recreational use, although the coal producing areas still have railroads running at near capacity. Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, this would mean the collapse of Shattara-Moneton culture. Many ancient man-made earthen mounds from various prehistoric mound builder cultures survive, especially in the areas of present-day Moundsville, South Charleston, and Romney. Located at the approximate midpoint of the Appalachian Trail, Harpers Ferry is the base of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.
