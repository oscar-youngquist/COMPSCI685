\Predicted Summary:
Utah collects personal income tax This micro climate of enhanced snowfall from the Great Salt Lake spans the entire proximity of the lake. Utah has the potential to generate 31.6 TWh/year from 13.1 GW of wind power, and 10,290 TWh/year from solar power using 4,048 GW of photovoltaic (PV), including 5.6 GW of rooftop photovoltaic, and 1,638 GW of concentrated solar power. Senatortors, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, are Republican. The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Utah government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Western Utah is mostly arid desert with a basin and range topography. Settlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847. I-15 traverses the state north-to-south, entering from Arizona near St. George, paralleling the Wasatch Front, and crossing into Idaho near Portage. The city of Provo, Utah was named for one, Ã‰tienne Provost, who visited the area in 1825. Although wagons and supplies were burned, eventually the troops arrived in 1858, and Young surrendered official control to Cumming, although most subsequent commentators claim that Young retained true power in the territory. Self-identified Latter-day Saints are more likely to vote for the Republican ticket than non-Mormons.
