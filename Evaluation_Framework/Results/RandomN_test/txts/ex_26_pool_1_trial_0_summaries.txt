Intent:
How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Executive authority in the state rests with the governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republican). Unlike the federal government, but like many other US States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor. Legislative authority resides in the General Assembly, composed of the Senatorte and House of Representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senatorte, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker. State judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which have statewide authority. Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected to four-year terms by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction. Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Several counties have a sole Commissioner form of government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person.
\Predicted Summary:
As of 2010, 87.35% (7,666,663) of Georgia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.42% (651,583) spoke Spanish, 0.51% (44,702) Korean, 0.44% (38,244) Vietnamese, 0.42% (36,679) French, 0.38% (33,009) Chinese (which includes Mandarin), and German, which was spoken as a main language by 0.29% (23,351) of the population over the age of 5. Popular novels related to this include Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, Olive Ann Burns' Cold Sassy Tree, and Alice Walker's The Color Purple. For every election between that year and 2020, Georgia voted heavily Republican, in line with many of its neighbors in the Deep South. State judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which have statewide authority. Due to anthropogenic Climate change the climate of Georgia is warming. Its 2019 estimated population was 10,617,423, according to the US Census Bureau. From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state. WSB was only the second such operation founded in the Southern US, trailing only WTVR in Richmond, Virginia. In addition to Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson, there are eight other airports serving major commercial traffic in Georgia. In 1964, it was one of only a handful of states to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater over Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson.

GT:
As with all other US states and the federal government, Georgia's government is based on the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial power. Both the Governor of Georgia and lieutenant governor are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other US States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor. Legislative authority resides in the General Assembly, composed of the Senatorte and House of Representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senatorte, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker. The Georgia Constitution mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives. The term of office for senators and representatives is two years. The laws enacted by the General Assembly are codified in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. State judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which have statewide authority. Georgia recognizes all local units of government as cities, so every incorporated town is legally a city. Georgia does not provide for townships or independent cities, though there have been bills proposed in the Legislature to provide for townships; it does allow consolidated city-county governments by local referendum.
