What about this state's arts and culture attracts you the most?

Input:
West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi ("Mountaineers are always free"). In addition to such outdoor recreation opportunities, the state offers a number of historic and cultural attractions. West Virginia has numerous popular festivals throughout the year. West Virginia is an alcoholic beverage control state. West Virginia is home to college sports teams from two schools—West Virginia and Marshall—that play in NCAA Division I. West Virginia is also home to several professional minor league baseball, football, soccer, and other sports teams. West Virginia's folk heritage is a part of the Appalachian folk music tradition, and includes styles of fiddling, ballad singing, and other styles that draw on Scots-Irish music. The Capitol Complex in Charleston hosts The Vandalia Gathering, where traditional Appalachian musicians compete in contests and play in impromptu jam sessions and evening concerts over the weekend. The West Virginia Cultural Center in Charleston is home to the West Virginia Division of Culture and History, which helps underwrite and coordinate a large number of musical activities. The program also travels to other venues in the state such as the West Virginia University Creative Arts Center in Morgantown. The center hosts concerts sponsored by the Friends of Old Time Music and Dance, which brings an assortment of acoustic roots music to West Virginians. The center also hosts the West Virginia Dance Festival, which features classical and modern dance.
\Predicted Summary:
Located in the Appalachian Mountain range, West Virginia covers an area of 24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km2), with 24,077.73 square miles (62,361.0 km2) of land and 152.03 square miles (393.8 km2) of water, making it the 41st-largest state in the United States. The Manahoac were probably forced out in the 1680s, when the Iroquois began to invade Virginia. Sea level rose and fell many times during the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian eras, giving a variety of rock strata. The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western Virginia. Airports, railroads, and rivers complete the commercial transportation modes for West Virginia. In 2008, 58% favored troop withdrawal from Iraq while just 32% wanted troops to remain. The state is regarded as a "deep red" state at the federal level. Other projects under development are a four-lane upgrade of US 35 from Scott Depot to the Ohio River at Point Pleasant, which is about two-thirds complete; a four lane upgrade of WV 10 from Logan to Man and then of WV 80 from Man to Gilbert, which is about half completed; and four lane upgrades to US 52 from Bluefield to Williamson, known as the "King Coal Highway" and from Williamson to Huntington, known as the "Tolsia Highway" which are many years from completion. For the 1963 Centennial of the State, it hosted two high school graduate delegates from each of the 50 States at the National Youth Science Camp near Bartow, and has continued this tradition ever since. Harpers Ferry was the site of John Brown's 1859 raid on the US Armory and Arsenal. A 2010 analysis of a local stalagmite revealed that Native Americans were burning forests to clear land as early as 100 BCE. It was declared the official state fossil of West Virginia in 2008. The first steps toward this change had been taken, however, by the Republicans in 1870.
