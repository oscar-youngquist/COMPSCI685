Input:
The unique position of West Virginia means it is often included in several US geographical regions, including the Mid-Atlantic, the Upland South, and the Southeastern United States. Tribes that inhabited West Virginia as of 1600 were the Siouan Monongahela Culture to the north, the Fort Ancient culture along the Ohio River from the Monongahela to Kentucky and extending an unknown distance inland, and the Eastern Siouan Tutelo and Moneton tribes in the southeast. West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi ("Mountaineers are always free"). The state's Northern Panhandle, and North-Central region feel an affinity for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Also, those in the Eastern Panhandle feel a connection with the Washington, D.C. suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, and southern West Virginians often consider themselves Southerners. In addition to such outdoor recreation opportunities, the state offers a number of historic and cultural attractions. West Virginia has numerous popular festivals throughout the year. West Virginia is an alcoholic beverage control state. This was a legacy of West Virginia's very strong tradition of union membership. West Virginia is also home to several professional minor league baseball, football, soccer, and other sports teams. West Virginia's folk heritage is a part of the Appalachian folk music tradition, and includes styles of fiddling, ballad singing, and other styles that draw on Scots-Irish music. The West Virginia Cultural Center in Charleston is home to the West Virginia Division of Culture and History, which helps underwrite and coordinate a large number of musical activities. The program also travels to other venues in the state such as the West Virginia University Creative Arts Center in Morgantown. The center hosts concerts sponsored by the Friends of Old Time Music and Dance, which brings an assortment of acoustic roots music to West Virginians.
