What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer, with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world. Mining shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see Silver mining in Nevada). From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the US percentage-wise. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent. Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada. The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching. Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment. The economy of Nevada has long been tied to vice industries. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada. The largest employers in the state, as of the first fiscal quarter of 2011, are the following, according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation: Nevada has had a thriving solar energy sector. Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined.
\Predicted Summary:
There have been a number of proposals to re-introduce service to either Los Angeles or Southern California. The southern third of the state, where the Las Vegas area is situated, is within the Mojave Desert. Marijuana in all forms remains illegal under federal law. As of December 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.8%. This line begins in Lake Tahoe nearly 4 miles (6.4 km) offshore (in the direction of the boundary), and continues to the Colorado River where the Nevada, California, and Arizona boundaries merge 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the Laughlin Bridge. Statehood was rushed to the date of October 31 to help ensure Abraham Lincoln's reelection on November 8 and post-Civil War Republican dominance in Congress, as Nevada's mining-based economy tied it to the more industrialized Union. The minimum Nevada sales tax rate changed on July 1, 2009. Lake County, one of the original nine counties formed in 1861, was renamed Roop County in 1862. Nevadans pronounce the second syllable with the "a" as in "trap" () while some people from outside of the state can pronounce it with the "a" as in "palm" (). Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. In the 21st century, the Las Vegas area has become a significant regional center for college basketball conference tournaments. This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Las Vegas grew from a gulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 by 1950 to 100,000 by 1970, and was America's fastest-growing city and metropolitan area from 1960 to 2000. Nevada is officially known as the "Silver State" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. North Carolina is the only other team to accomplish that (2007–08, 2008–09). The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno.

The economy of Nevada has long been tied to vice industries. "[Nevada was] founded on mining and refounded on sin – beginning with prizefighting and easy divorce a century ago and later extending to gaming and prostitution", said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. By value, gold is by far the most important mineral mined. Other minerals mined in Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite and lithium. Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high, and output is very sensitive to world commodity prices. Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada. As of January 1, 2006, there were an estimated 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada. Over 90% of Nevada's 484,000 acres (196,000 ha) of cropland is used to grow hay, mostly alfalfa, for livestock feed.
