Essentially, many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities, in many cases donating land and/or labor to build such schools. In the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in Mississippi and establish Freedom Schools. By 1860, a majority—55 percent—of the population of Mississippi was enslaved. The state needed many more settlers for development. In 1960 they made up 42% of the state's population. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern Yazoo Delta, and the southwestern and the central parts of the state. As of 2010, Mississippi remained a stronghold of the denomination, which originally was brought by Scots immigrants. George Ohr, known as the "Mad Potter of Biloxi" and the father of abstract expressionism in pottery, lived and worked in Biloxi, MS.
