The Minnesota Vikings have played in the National Football League since their admission as an expansion franchise in 1961. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. The Northstar Line commuter rail service runs from Big Lake to the Target Field station in downtown Minneapolis. The rate of population change, and age and gender distributions, approximate the national average. The state's iron-mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in the Vermilion and Mesabi ranges in the 1880s, followed by the Cuyuna Range in the early 1900s. Each district has one senator and two representatives, each senatorial district being divided into A and B sections for members of the House.
