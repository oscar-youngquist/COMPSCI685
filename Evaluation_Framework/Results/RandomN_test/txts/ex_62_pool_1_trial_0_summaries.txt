The total state product in 2015 was $318.6 billion. The state's economy is diversified, and is notable for its concentration of scientific research and high-technology industries. Colorado now also has the largest annual production of beer of any state. The state's diverse geography and majestic mountains attract millions of tourists every year, including 85.2 million in 2018. Many counties and cities charge their own rates, in addition to the base state rate. Much of the state is sunny, and could produce solar power.
