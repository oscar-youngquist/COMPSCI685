How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time. It still has a substantial presence in the state. Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches. The Delaware General Assembly consists of a House of Representatives with 41 members and a Senatorte with 21 members. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senatorte confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor. The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts: The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The governor presents a "State of the State" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually. This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware including Senatorte and House. New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the legislature The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two statewide offices in 2014, State Auditor and State Treasurer. The state is also served by several weekly, monthly and online publications.
\Predicted Summary:
DE 9 is a north–south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the Delaware Bay. Delaware was the last US state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952. The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire (the sound [ä] often mutated in [æ]) also appear in old texts cited by Lucien Musset, where the word ga(i)ra means gore. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include DE 1, DE 9, and DE 404. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending 12 miles (19.3 km) from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of New Castle. The Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. Delaware has six different income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc. The table below lists the ten largest municipalities in the state based on the 2018 United States Census Estimate. An independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave Peter Spencer as the "Union Church of Africans". In addition local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. This was renamed as the African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection, more commonly known as the A.U.M.P. It was initially colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near the present town of Lewes, in 1631. As of 2011, 49.7% of Delaware's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two parents of non-Hispanic white ancestry). Significantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of Chancery in the nation, which has jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to mergers and acquisitions. The Atlantic Seaboard fall line approximately follows the Robert Kirkwood Highway between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road is the Atlantic Coastal Plain with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground. As of January 2012, none of the State's charter schools are members of a teachers union.

Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches. The Delaware General Assembly consists of a House of Representatives with 41 members and a Senatorte with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts: Minor non-constitutional courts include the Justice of the Peace Courts and Aldermen's Courts. Delaware was the last US state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952. The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The governor presents a "State of the State" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually. Delaware is subdivided into three counties; from north to south they are New Castle, Kent and Sussex. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions. The Democratic Party holds a plurality of registrations in Delaware. Each of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government. Tax is collected by the Delaware Division of Revenue. Delaware has six different income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.
