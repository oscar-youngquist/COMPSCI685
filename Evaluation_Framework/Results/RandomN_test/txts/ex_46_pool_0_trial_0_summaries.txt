What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the Union Pacific. This railroad also provides the tracks for Amtrak's California Zephyr passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways. Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado, and is the busiest US hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States. Extensive public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city—including the Denver metro area's extensive RTD services. The Regional Transportation District (RTD) operates the popular RTD Bus & Rail transit system in the Denver Metropolitan Area. Amtrak operates two passenger rail lines in Colorado, the California Zephyr and Southwest Chief. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado. Colorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage.
\Predicted Summary:
Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction. The Food & Wine Classic is held annually each June in Aspen, Colorado. The state generated tax, fee, and license revenue of $194 million in 2016 on legal marijuana sales. In 1864, Territorial Governor John Evans appointed the Reverend John Chivington as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colorado has significant hydrocarbon resources. Estes model rockets were launched in Penrose in 1958. East of the Rocky Mountains are the Colorado Eastern Plains of the High Plains, the section of the Great Plains within Nebraska at elevations ranging from roughly 3,350 to 7,500 feet (1,020 to 2,290 m). Higher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, Western Colorado University in Gunnison, Fort Lewis College in Durango, and Colorado Mountain College in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs. The state's fastest-growing counties are Douglas and Weld. As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation. The Denver Pacific Railway reached Denver in June the following year, and the Kansas Pacific arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent.
