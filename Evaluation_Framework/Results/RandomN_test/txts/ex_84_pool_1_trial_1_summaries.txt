\Predicted Summary:
Tennessee's only graded stakes horse race, the Iroquois Steeplechase, is also held in Nashville each May. Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics, but in the 1880s, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, Tennessee was largely held by Union forces. US troops forced them to march from "emigration depots" in Eastern Tennessee, such as Fort Cass, toward the more distant Indian Territory west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma. After its completion, Captain Raymond Demeré relinquished command on August 14, 1757, to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré. In 2018, Republican businessman Bill Lee was elected to succeed term-limited Haslam, and he became the 50th Governor of Tennessee. What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later part of the Southwest Territory. After the formal end of Reconstruction, the struggle over power in Southern society continued. Winfield Dunn and former US Senator Bill Brock wins in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among whites for the statewide victory. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, in 2011 Tennessee's real gross state product was $233.997 billion.In 2003, the per capita personal income was $28,641, 36th in the nation, and 91% of the national per capita personal income of $31,472. Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796.
