How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Each county runs on Commissioners' Court system consisting of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts in the county, roughly divided according to population) and a county judge elected at large from the entire county. County government runs similar to a "weak" mayor-council system; the county judge has no veto authority, but votes along with the other commissioners. Counties are not granted home rule status Municipalities are classified either "general law" cities or "home rule". County and state elections are partisan. Instead, the state collects revenue from property taxes (though these are collected at the county, city, and school district level; Texas has a state constitutional prohibition against a state property tax) and sales taxes. During his term, the state set aside three leagues of land in each county for equipping public schools. Like many states, it explicitly provides for a separation of powers. The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart, and has provisions unique to Texas. Texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the secretary of state, voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. The executive branch positions consist of the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller of public accounts, land commissioner, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the secretary of state. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment. The Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. What are called commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm. Most cities in the state, those over 5,000 in population, have home-rule governments.
\Predicted Summary:
The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east. Archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather. The Hispanics in Texas are more likely than in some other states (such as California) to identify as white; according to the 2010 US Census, Texas is home to 6,304,207 White Hispanics and 2,594,206 Hispanics of "some other race" (usually mestizo). Texas has 254 counties, which is more than any other state by 95 (Georgia). Migrants abandoned the worst-hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town. The Energy Information Administration states the state's large agriculture and forestry industries could give Texas an enormous amount biomass for use in biofuels. The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land. The Texas A&M Aggies left the Big 12 and joined the Southeastern Conference in 2012, which led the Big 12 to invite TCU to join; TCU was previously in the Mountain West Conference. Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns. The "Lone Star" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal. It served as the largest hub for the former Continental Airlines, which was based in Houston; it serves as the largest hub for United Airlines, the world's third-largest airline, by passenger-miles flown. These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle. The name Deep Ellum comes from local people pronouncing "Deep Elm" as "Deep Ellum". The state's conservative white voters began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. Since the campaign's inception in 1986, the phrase has become "an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger". Texas throughout the 21st century has been hammered by drought.

The current Texas Constitution was adopted in 1876. Like many states, it explicitly provides for a separation of powers. The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart, and has provisions unique to Texas. Texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the secretary of state, voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. The executive branch positions consist of the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller of public accounts, land commissioner, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the secretary of state. The bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives, with 150 members, and a Senatorte, with 31 members. The Speaker of the House leads the House, and the lieutenant governor, the Senatorte. The judiciary of Texas is one of the most complex in the United States, with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the Texas Supreme Court, for civil cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment. The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety is a law enforcement agency with statewide jurisdiction. The Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. What are called commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm. Most cities in the state, those over 5,000 in population, have home-rule governments. The vast majority of these have charters for council-manager forms of government, by which voters elect council members, who hire a professional city manager as an operating officer.
