\Predicted Summary:
Voters thus did not participate in presidential elections, other than through state-wide elections. In the 1670s, English planters from Barbados established themselves near what is now Charleston. These tribes were village-dwellers, relying on agriculture as their primary food source. The following table shows the major metropolitan areas of South Carolina. Several large venues can house major events, including Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, and North Charleston Coliseum. The environment here is that of the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests ecoregion. Many large corporations have moved their locations to South Carolina. The area surrounding the Blue Ridge Mountains is known as the Upstate. For example, a man was not eligible to sit in the State House of Representatives unless he possessed an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 Negroes, or at least 150 pounds sterling, diminishing the electorate. Also relevant are the state constitution, law enforcement agencies, federal representation, state finances, and state taxes. Industrial outputs include textile goods, chemical products, paper products, machinery, automobiles, automotive products and tourism.
