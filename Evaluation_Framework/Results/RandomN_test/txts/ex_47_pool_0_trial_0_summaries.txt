\Predicted Summary:
From statehood through the late 1940s, Arizona was primarily dominated by the Democratic Party. After Maricopa County did not allow them to register to vote, in 1948 veteran Frank Harrison and Harry Austin, of the Mojave-Apache Tribe at Fort McDowell Indian Reservation, brought a legal suit, Harrison and Austin v. Laveen, to challenge this exclusion. As of 2010, 72.9% (4,215,749) of Arizona residents age five and older spoke only English at home, while 20.8% (1,202,638) spoke Spanish, 1.5% (85,602) Navajo, 0.4% (22,592) German, 0.4% (22,426) Chinese (which includes Mandarin), 0.3% (19,015) Tagalog, 0.3% (17,603) Vietnamese, 0.3% (15,707) Other North American Indigenous Languages (especially indigenous languages of Arizona), and French was spoken as a main language by 0.3% (15,062) of the population over the age of five. Glen Campbell, a notable resident, popularized the song "By The Time I Get To Phoenix". Due to its numerous golf courses, Arizona is home to several stops on the PGA Tour, most notably the Phoenix Open, held at the TPC of Scottsdale, and the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Marana. Several major Hollywood films, such as Billy Jack, U Turn, Waiting to Exhale, Just One of the Guys, Can't Buy Me Love, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Scorpion King, The Banger Sisters, Used Cars, and Raising Arizona have been made there (as have many Westerns). In 2002, this was an area of the Rodeo–Chediski Fire, the worst fire in state history until 2011. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state's population and cast almost 80 percent of the state's vote. Its climate has exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five National League West titles, one National League Championship pennant, and the 2001 World Series.
