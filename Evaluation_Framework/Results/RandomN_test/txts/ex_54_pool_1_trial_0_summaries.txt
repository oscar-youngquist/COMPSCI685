The Vikings have advanced to the Super Bowl Super Bowl IV, Super Bowl VIII, Super Bowl IX, and Super Bowl XI, losing all four games to their AFC/AFL opponent Treaties between the US Government and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands and onto reservations. Minnesotans participate in high levels of physical activity, and many of these activities are outdoors. Minnesota experiences temperature extremes characteristic of its continental climate, with cold winters and hot summers. Today Minnesota has 72 state parks and recreation areas, 58 state forests covering about four million acres (16,000 km2), and numerous state wildlife preserves, all managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. The team plays at Allianz Field in St. Paul. Minnesota is the second northernmost US state (after Alaska) and northernmost contiguous state, as the isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states north of the 49th parallel. Its flat bed now is the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling.
