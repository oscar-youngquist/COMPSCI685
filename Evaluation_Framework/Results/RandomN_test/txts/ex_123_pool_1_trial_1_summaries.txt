Most of Massachusetts has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers.

On April 22, 2020, the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs of Massachusetts, Kathleen A. Theoharides, released a Determination of Statewide Emissions limits for 2050. To ensure that the Commonwealth experiences warming no more than 1.5°C of pre-industrialization levels, the state will work to achieve net-zero emissions and the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent by the year 2050.
