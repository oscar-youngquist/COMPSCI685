How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state is the 21st-most extensive in area. However, the elected legislative body was split between pro-Union and pro-Confederate. With the elected governor absent from the capital and the legislators largely dispersed, the state convention was reassembled with most of its members present, save twenty who fled south with Jackson's forces. It provides for three branches of government: the legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The legislative branch consists of two bodies: the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. The Senatorte consists of 34 members from districts of approximately equal populations. The judicial department comprises the Supreme Court of Missouri, which has seven judges, the Missouri Court of Appeals (an intermediate appellate court divided into three districts), sitting in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Springfield, and 45 Circuit Courts which function as local trial courts. The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Missouri and includes five other statewide elected offices. At the state level, both Democratic Senatortor Claire McCaskill and Democratic Governor Jay Nixon were re-elected. The Missouri State Board of Education has general authority over all public education in the state of Missouri. It is made up of eight citizens appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Missouri Senatorte. District territories are often complex in structure.
\Predicted Summary:
Missouri's culture blends elements from the Midwestern and Southern United States. From 1764 to 1803, European control of the area west of the Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri River basin, called Louisiana, was assumed by the Spanish as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, due to Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order to have Spain join with France in the war against England). Fishermen, hikers, campers, and others started lobbying to protect forest areas with a "wilderness character." Perry County is the county with the largest number of caves and the single longest cave. It was the oldest college rivalry west of the Mississippi River and the second-oldest in the nation. Hannibalâ€“LaGrange University in Hannibal, Missouri, was one of the first colleges west of the Mississippi (founded 1858 in LaGrange, Missouri, and moved to Hannibal in 1928). Exempt real estate includes property owned by governments and property used as nonprofit cemeteries, exclusively for religious worship, for schools and colleges, and purely charitable purposes. During the 1930s and 1940s Aldo Leopold, Arthur Carhart and Bob Marshall developed a "wilderness" policy for the Forest Service. Missouri is ranked 6th in the nation for the production of hogs and 7th for cattle. Females were approximately 51.4 percent of the population. A grand jury declined to indict the officer, and the US Department of Justice concluded, after careful investigation, that the police officer legitimately feared for his safety. Five percent was generated by natural gas.
