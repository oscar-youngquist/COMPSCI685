What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
Idaho is among the few states in the nation without a major freeway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north. US-95 links the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it is badly in need of repair and upgrade. I-84 is the main highway linking the southeast and southwest portions of the state, along with I-86 and I-15. Major airports include the Boise International Airport which serves the southwest region of Idaho and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) which serves northern Idaho. Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads. Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop being in Sandpoint. The Union Pacific Railroad also crosses southern Idaho traveling between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls, and Pocatello.
