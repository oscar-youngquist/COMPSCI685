What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), also known as "The T", operates public transportation in the form of subway, bus, and ferry systems in the Metro Boston area. Fifteen other regional transit authorities provide public transportation in the form of bus services in the rest of the state. Amtrak operates several inter-city rail lines connecting Massachusetts. Boston's South Station serves as the terminus for three lines, namely the high-speed Acela Express, which links to cities such as Providence, New Haven, New York City, and eventually Washington DC; the Northeast Regional, which follows the same route but includes many more stops, and also continues further south to Newport News in Virginia; and the Lake Shore Limited, which runs westward to Worcester, Springfield, and eventually Chicago. Outside of Boston, Amtrak connects several cities across Massachusetts, along the aforementioned Acela, Northeast Regional, Lake Shore Limited, and Downeaster lines, as well as other routes in central and western Massachusetts. Amtrak carries more passengers between Boston and New York than all airlines combined (about 54% of market share in 2012), but service between other cities is less frequent. This overlaps with the service areas of neighboring regional transportation authorities. Ferry services are operated throughout different regions of the states. Several regional and short line railroads also provide service and connect with other railroads. There are a total of 36,800 miles (59,200 km) of interstates and other highways in Massachusetts. Major non-interstate highways in Massachusetts include US Routes 1, 3, 6, and 20, and state routes 2, 3, 9, 24, and 128.

Although the documentation is incomplete, about 1,700 letters of marque, issued on a per-voyage basis, were granted during the American Revolution. Other counties have been reorganized, and a few still retain county councils. Far southeast coastal areas are the broad transition zone to Humid Subtropical climates. I-495 forms a wide loop around the outer edge of Greater Boston. Boston-Logan International Airport is the busiest airport in New England, serving 33.4 million total passengers in 2015, and witnessing rapid growth in international air traffic since 2010. The public University of Massachusetts (nicknamed UMass) features five campuses in the state, with its flagship campus in Amherst, which enrolls more than 25,000. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (a chief justice and six associates) are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the executive council, as are all other judges in the state. To the west lies the hilly, rural region of Central Massachusetts, and beyond that, the Connecticut River Valley. Massachusetts is the sixth-most popular tourist destination for foreign travelers.
