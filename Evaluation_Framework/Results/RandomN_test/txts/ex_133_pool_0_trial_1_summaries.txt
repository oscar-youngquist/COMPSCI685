Intent:
What about this state's arts and culture attracts you the most?

Input:
United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, parks, and wildlife refuges. Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the Alaska State Fair in Palmer the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. Alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of NCAA Division I. Some of Alaska's popular annual events are the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Blueberry Festival and Alaska Hummingbird Festival in Ketchikan, the Sitka Whale Fest, and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in Wrangell. The Alaska Native Heritage Center celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. The Alaska Native Arts Foundation promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra, though the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and Juneau Symphony are also notable. The Anchorage Opera is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.
\Predicted Summary:
A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 20 indigenous languages, known locally as "native languages". Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. Between 1774 and 1800, Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although by early 2014 North Dakota's Bakken Formation was producing over 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d). Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from "Outside", and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. The governor of Alaska serves four-year terms. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. Alaska Natives, while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the Native corporations. Its per capita personal income for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation. Most of the population lives along the coast.
