What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
It borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east. It then flows northeasterly across the state through Billings, Miles City, Glendive, and Sidney. In 1881, the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch line of the Union Pacific, completed a narrow-gauge line from northern Utah to Butte. A number of smaller spur lines operated in Montana from 1881 into the 20th century, including the Oregon Short Line, Montana Railroad, and Milwaukee Road. Other railroads followed suit. Railroads have been an important method of transportation in Montana since the 1880s. Historically, the state was traversed by the main lines of three east–west transcontinental routes: the Milwaukee Road, the Great Northern, and the Northern Pacific. Today, the BNSF Railway is the state's largest railroad, its main transcontinental route incorporating the former Great Northern main line across the state. Montana RailLink, a privately held Class II railroad, operates former Northern Pacific trackage in western Montana. In addition, Amtrak's Empire Builder train runs through the north of the state, stopping in Libby, Whitefish, West Glacier, Essex, East Glacier Park, Browning, Cut Bank, Shelby, Havre, Malta, Glasgow, and Wolf Point. Montana's other major airports include Missoula International Airport, Great Falls International Airport, Glacier Park International Airport, Helena Regional Airport, Bert Mooney Airport and Yellowstone Airport. Eight smaller communities have airports designated for commercial service under the Essential Air Service program. Historically, US Route 10 was the primary east–west highway route across Montana, connecting the major cities in the southern half of the state. Still the state's most important east–west travel corridor, the route is today served by Interstate 90 and Interstate 94 which roughly follow the same route as the Northern Pacific. Routes 2 and 12 and Montana Highway 200 also traverse the entire state from east to west. Other major north–south highways include US Routes 87, 89, 93 and 191.
\Predicted Summary:
Ecotaxes on resource extraction are numerous. Extreme hot weather is less common above 4,000 feet or 1,200 meters. Farther east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka contain some of the most scenic badlands regions in the state. Other significant economic resources include oil, gas, coal, mining, and lumber. Eight smaller communities have airports designated for commercial service under the Essential Air Service program. Many Native Americans were among those who served, including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became Code Talkers. After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would be owned by the settler. These dealings were not always peaceful, and though the fur trade brought some material gain for indigenous tribal groups, it also brought exposure to European diseases and altered their economic and cultural traditions. Other railroads followed suit. The first constitution was drafted by a constitutional convention in 1889, in preparation for statehood. Some estimates say more than 13 million bison were in Montana in 1870. Montaña del Norte was the name given by early Spanish explorers to the entire mountainous region of the west. The legislature in turn adopted this recommendation by a wide margin. Montana District Courts are the courts of general jurisdiction in Montana. Montana's House district is the largest congressional district in the United States by population, with just over 1,023,000 constituents. The Rocky Mountain Front is a significant feature in the state's north-central portion, and isolated island ranges that interrupt the prairie landscape common in the central and eastern parts of the state. Montana is the home of the Federation of Fly Fishers and hosts many of the organizations annual conclaves.

Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport is the busiest airport in the state of Montana, surpassing Billings Logan International Airport in the spring of 2013. Montana's other major airports include Missoula International Airport, Great Falls International Airport, Glacier Park International Airport, Helena Regional Airport, Bert Mooney Airport and Yellowstone Airport.

US Routes 2 and 12 and Montana Highway 200 also traverse the entire state from east to west. Montana's only north–south Interstate Highway is Interstate 15. Other major north–south highways include US Routes 87, 89, 93 and 191. Montana and South Dakota are the only states to share a land border which is not traversed by a paved road. Highway 212, the primary paved route between the two, passes through the northeast corner of Wyoming between Montana and South Dakota.
