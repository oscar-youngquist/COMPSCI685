What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
Jackson is both the state's capital and largest city. The state's name is derived from the Mississippi River, which flows along and defines its western boundary. Mississippi is bordered to the north by Tennessee, to the east by Alabama, to the south by Louisiana and a narrow coast on the Gulf of Mexico; and to the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and Arkansas. (See: Lists of cities, towns and villages, census-designated places, metropolitan areas, micropolitan areas, and counties in Mississippi) Two bands of historical prairie, the Jackson Prairie and the Black Belt, run northwest to southeast in the middle and northeastern part of the state. Plantations were developed primarily along the major rivers, where the waterfront provided access to the major transportation routes. They also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors. Mississippi has six airports with commercial passenger service, the busiest in Jackson (Jackson-Evers International Airport) and one in Gulfport (Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport) Mississippi is served by nine interstate highways: Routes: as well as a system of State Highways. Amtrak provides scheduled passenger service along two routes, the Crescent and City of New Orleans. All but two of the United States Class I railroads serve Mississippi (the exceptions are the Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific):
\Predicted Summary:
The Civil Rights Movement had many roots in religion, and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism. The state capital, Jackson, ranks tenth in the nation in concentration of African-American same-sex couples. In 1960 they made up 42% of the state's population. More than 100,000 people have left the region in search of work elsewhere. The coastline includes large bays at Bay St. Louis, Biloxi, and Pascagoula. This ranks the state second-highest nationally, and represents an increase from 1995, when Mississippi received $1.54 per dollar of taxes in federal spending and was 3rd highest nationally. In the migration of 1910â€“1940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. This is also where early towns developed, linked by the steamboats that carried commercial products and crops to markets. This opened up land for sale to European-American migrant settlement. The peoples had a trading network spanning the continent from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. In 2012, Mississippi had the sixth largest gambling revenue of any state, with $2.25 billion. This ballet competition attracts the most talented young dancers from around the world. In 1900, blacks made up more than half of the state's population. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.
