It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware is also a de facto onshore corporate haven, in which by virtue of its corporate laws, the state is the domicile of over 50% of all NYSE-listed business and 60% of the Fortune 500. Delaware is one of five states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census. It still has a substantial presence in the state. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Delaware had the ninth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.2 percent. The state's largest employers are: More than half of all US publicly traded companies, and 63% of the Fortune 500, are incorporated in Delaware. Franchise taxes on Delaware corporations supply about a fifth of the state's revenue. This is the fewest among all states. Wilmington is the state's most populous city (70,635) and its economic hub. In 2015, tourism in Delaware generated $3.1 billion, which makes up five percent of the state's GDP.
\Predicted Summary:
Following the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the Battle of Cooch's Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777, at Cooch's Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a minor Loyalist rebellion in 1778. In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at present-day New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch New Netherland. The surname de La Warr comes from Sussex and is of Anglo-Norman origin. So it was that New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and Kent County native John Dickinson became the "Penman of the Revolution." In 1814, Spencer called for the first annual gathering, known as the Big August Quarterly, which continues to draw members of this denomination and their descendants together in a religious and cultural festival. Delaware is represented in rugby by the Delaware Black Foxes, a 2015 expansion club. Before Delaware was settled by European colonists, the area was home to the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as the Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mostly along the coast, and the Nanticoke who occupied much of the southern Delmarva Peninsula. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington and the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware oversee the parishes within their denominations. The racial composition of the state was: Delaware is home to an Amish community which resides west of Dover in Kent County, consisting of nine church districts and about 1,650 people.

The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. Delaware provides government subsidy support for the clean-up of property "lightly contaminated" by hazardous waste, the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales. Delaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile more than the national average, and ranking 45th in population. Delaware is one of five states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census. As of 2011, 49.7% of Delaware's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two parents of non-Hispanic white ancestry). Delaware has six different income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. In June 2018, Delaware became the first US state to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court ruling to repeal The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). Unlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions. This centralized system, combined with the small size of the state, likely contributed to Delaware becoming the first state, after completion of a three-year, $30 million program ending in 1999, to wire every K-12 classroom in the state to the Internet. As of 2011, the Delaware Department of Education had authorized the founding of 25 charter schools in the state, one of them being all-girls. All teachers in the State's public school districts are unionized.
