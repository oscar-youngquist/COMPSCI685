Intent:
What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
The Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power that it once had. Other important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. Rhode Island's 2000 total gross state production was $46.18 billion (adjusted to inflation), placing it 45th in the nation. Additionally, Rhode Island is rated as the 5th most energy efficient state in the country. Health services are Rhode Island's largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism-related sales at $4.56 billion (adjusted to inflation) in the year 2000. The third-largest industry is manufacturing. Its industrial outputs are submarine construction, shipbuilding, costume jewelry, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, machinery, and boatbuilding. Rhode Island's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs. As of March 2011, the largest employers in Rhode Island (excluding employees of municipalities) are the following:
\Predicted Summary:
The referendum election was held on November 2, 2010, and the people voted overwhelmingly (78% to 22%) to retain the entire original name. Rhode Island's tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution. Many Rhode Islanders distinguish a strong aw sound [ɔə] (i.e., do not exhibit the cot–caught merger) as one might hear in New Jersey or New York City; for example, the word coffee is pronounced [ˈkʰɔəfi]. The earliest documented use of the name "Rhode Island" for Aquidneck was in 1637 by Roger Williams. Touro Synagogue was the first synagogue in America, founded in Newport in 1763. Slaves were introduced in Rhode Island at this time, although there is no record of any law legalizing slave-holding. It is only 37 miles (60 km) wide and 48 miles (77 km) long, yet the state has a tidal shoreline on Narragansett Bay and the Atlantic Ocean of 384 miles (618 km). The state takes its name from Rhode Island; however, most of the state is located on the mainland. The Grays played in the National League from 1878 to 1885. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. Rhode Islanders developed a unique style of architecture in the 17th century called the stone-ender. Service was discontinued as of 2010. In 2011, 40.3% of Rhode Island's children under the age of one belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.

GT:
The Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power that it once had. Other important industries in Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial history is the number of abandoned factories, many of them now being used for condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. Per the 2013 American Communities Survey, Rhode Island has the highest paid elementary school teachers in the country, with an average salary of $75,028 (adjusted to inflation). Rhode Island's 2000 total gross state production was $46.18 billion (adjusted to inflation), placing it 45th in the nation. Health services are Rhode Island's largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism-related sales at $4.56 billion (adjusted to inflation) in the year 2000. The third-largest industry is manufacturing. Its industrial outputs are submarine construction, shipbuilding, costume jewelry, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, machinery, and boatbuilding. Rhode Island's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs. Rhode Island's taxes were appreciably higher than neighboring states, because Rhode Island's income tax was based on 25% of the payer's federal income tax payment.
