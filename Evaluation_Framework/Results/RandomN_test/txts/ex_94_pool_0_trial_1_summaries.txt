What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Michigan is the leading auto-producing state in the US, with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States; Ontario, Canada; and the Southern United States. Agriculture also serves a significant role, making the state a leading grower of fruit in the US, including blueberries, cherries, apples, grapes, and peaches. Manufacturing in the state grew 6.6% from 2001 to 2006, but the high speculative price of oil became a factor for the US auto industry during the economic crisis of 2008 impacting industry revenues. Its research and development, which includes automotive, comprises a higher percentage of the state's overall gross domestic product than for any other US state. The state is an important source of engineering job opportunities. A wide variety of commodity crops, fruits, and vegetables are grown in Michigan, making it second only to California among US states in the diversity of its agriculture. The state has 54,800 farms utilizing 10,000,000 acres (40,000 km2) of land which sold $6.49 billion worth of products in 2010. Hunting and fishing are significant industries in the state. The forest products industry and recreational users contribute $12 billion and 200,000 associated jobs annually to the state's economy.

Ford's development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked a new era in transportation. Automobile production became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, and permanently altered the socio-economic life of the United States and much of the world. Grand Rapids, the second-largest city in Michigan, is also an important center of manufacturing. In the 21st century, it is home to five of the world's leading office furniture companies.
