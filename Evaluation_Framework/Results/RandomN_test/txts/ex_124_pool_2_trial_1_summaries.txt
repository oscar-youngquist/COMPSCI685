Input:
Culturally, the coastal plain is split into the Lowcountry and the Pee Dee region. At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end of the Pre-Columbian era around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba, with the total population being up to 20,000. Up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of Siouan background. It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States. Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the Wars of Religion. Between 1670 and 1715, between 24,000 and 51,000 captive Native Americans were exported from South Carolina â€” more than the number of Africans imported to the colonies of the future United States during the same period. Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to other US colonies. Settlers from all over Europe built rice plantations in the South Carolina Lowcountry, east of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. Meanwhile, Upstate South Carolina, west of the Fall Line, was settled by small farmers and traders, who displaced Native American tribes westward. It allowed religious toleration, encouraging settlement, and trade in deerskin, lumber, and beef thrived. In the Antebellum period (before the Civil War) the state's economy and population grew. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century; and created tourism industries. During the early part of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs, opportunities and relative freedom in US cities outside the former Confederate states. South Carolina has many venues for visual and performing arts. There are also numerous historic sites and museums scattered throughout the state paying homage to many events and periods in the state's history from Native American inhabitation to the present day. Several large venues can house major events, including Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, and North Charleston Coliseum. There are also countless local festivals throughout the state highlighting many cultural traditions, historical events, and folklore.
\Predicted Summary:
His utopia was inspired by John Locke, an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of Liberalism". The state is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones. The Home Rule Act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties. In the Antebellum period (before the Civil War) the state's economy and population grew. South Carolina's state government consists of the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. South Carolina has several major lakes covering over 683 square miles (1,770 km2). For example, a man was not eligible to sit in the State House of Representatives unless he possessed an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 Negroes, or at least 150 pounds sterling, diminishing the electorate. It also became the first state to vote in favor of secession from the Union on December 20, 1860. In 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the Compromise of 1877 that ended Reconstruction. South Carolina ( (listen)) is a state in the Deep South region of the Southern United States. There are seven significant airports in South Carolina, all of which act as regional airport hubs. South Carolina averages around 50 days of thunderstorm activity a year. It is not uncommon for areas along the southernmost coast to not receive measurable snowfall for several years. Until the 1868 presidential election, South Carolina's legislature, not the voters, chose the state's electors for the presidential election. Industrial outputs include textile goods, chemical products, paper products, machinery, automobiles, automotive products and tourism. Annual average total amounts range from 2 to 6 inches. Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina, and the state averages around 14 tornadoes annually. This is less than some of the states further south, and it is slightly less vulnerable to tornadoes than the states which border on the Gulf of Mexico.

During the early part of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs, opportunities and relative freedom in US cities outside the former Confederate states. South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the Nineteenth Amendment (1920) giving women the right to vote. The South Carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on July 1, 1969. The Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, the Greenville County Museum of Art, the Columbia Museum of Art, Spartanburg Art Museum, and the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia among others provide access to visual arts to the state. South Carolina also has performing art venues including the Peace Center in Greenville, the Koger Center for the Arts in Columbia, and the Newberry Opera House, among others to bring local, national, and international talent to the stages of South Carolina. Several large venues can house major events, including Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, and North Charleston Coliseum. One of the nation's major performing arts festivals, Spoleto Festival USA, is held annually in Charleston. There are also countless local festivals throughout the state highlighting many cultural traditions, historical events, and folklore. According to the South Carolina Arts Commission, creative industries generate $9.2 billion annually and support over 78,000 jobs in the state. A 2009 statewide poll by the University of South Carolina Institute for Public Service and Policy Research found that 67% of residents had participated in the arts in some form during the past year and on average citizens had participated in the arts 14 times in the previous year.
