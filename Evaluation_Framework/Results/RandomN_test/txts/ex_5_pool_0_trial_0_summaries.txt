How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
It is the 8th most extensive and 21st most populous US state. Like the federal government and all other US states, Colorado's state constitution provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches. The Governor of Colorado heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is Jared Polis, a Democrat. Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the Lieutenant Governor of Colorado (elected on a ticket with the Governor), Secretary of State of Colorado, Colorado State Treasurer, and Attorney General of Colorado, all of whom serve four-year terms. The seven-member Colorado Supreme Court is the state's highest court, with seven justices. Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction. The state also has a water court, which sits in seven distinct divisions around the state and which decides matters relating to water rights and the use and administration of water. The state legislative body is the Colorado General Assembly, which is made up of two houses - the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. The House has 65 members and the Senatorte has 35. Coloradans have elected 17 Democrats and 12 Republicans to the governorship in the last 100 years.
\Predicted Summary:
In much of the region, March is the snowiest month. The Continental Divide of the Americas extends along the crest of the Rocky Mountains. Most American settlers traveling overland west to the Oregon Country, the new goldfields of California, or the new Mormon settlements of the State of Deseret in the Salt Lake Valley, avoided the rugged Southern Rocky Mountains, and instead followed the North Platte River and Sweetwater River to South Pass (Wyoming), the lowest crossing of the Continental Divide between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. Former Military installations and outposts include: The state legislative body is the Colorado General Assembly, which is made up of two houses - the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, which includes alpine mountains, high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons. Denver is known for steak, but now has a diverse culinary scene with many restaurants. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for ethanol production. In 1861, the United States Congress defined the boundaries of the new Territory of Colorado exclusively by lines of latitude and longitude, stretching from 37°N to 41°N latitude, and from 102°02′48″W to 109°02′48″W longitude (25°W to 32°W from the Washington Meridian). Colorado is open to cannabis (marijuana) tourism. In 1776, Spanish priest Silvestre Vélez de Escalante recorded that Native Americans in the area knew the river as el Rio Colorado for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains. The Lindenmeier Site in Larimer County contains artifacts dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC.

Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction. The state legislative body is the Colorado General Assembly, which is made up of two houses - the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. The House has 65 members and the Senatorte has 35. As of 2018, the Democratic Party holds a 19 to 16 majority in the Senatorte and a 41 to 24 majority in the House. Most Coloradans are native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census), and this is illustrated by the fact that the state did not have a native-born governor from 1975 (when John David Vanderhoof left office) until 2007, when Bill Ritter took office; his election the previous year marked the first electoral victory for a native-born Coloradan in a gubernatorial race since 1958 (Vanderhoof had ascended from the Lieutenant Governorship when John Arthur Love was given a position in Richard Nixon's administration in 1973). In the 2016 election, the Democratic party won the Colorado electoral college votes.
