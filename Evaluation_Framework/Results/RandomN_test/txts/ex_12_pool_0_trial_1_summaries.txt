Intent:
How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senatorte president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties. The legislature is called the General Court. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world, and 24 senators. The other state courts are the Probate Court, District Court, and the Family Division. New Hampshire is a "Dillon Rule" state, meaning the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities. Most towns generally operate on the town meeting form of government, where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature, and a board of selectmen acts as the executive of the town. Larger towns and the state's thirteen cities operate either on a council–manager or council–mayor form of government. All state-level statutes treat all municipalities identically. Nominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate primary election. The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senatorte, a first for any legislative body in the United States. Further, the state elected its second female governor: Democrat Maggie Hassan. Republicans control the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature, a governing trifecta in which the Republicans have full governing power. In the 116th United States Congress, it is one of only eight states with an entirely Democratic delegation, five of which are in New England (the others are Delaware, Hawaii, and New Mexico).
\Predicted Summary:
New Hampshire municipalities are classified as towns or cities, which differ primarily by the form of government. In the presidential race, the state voted for the Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, by a margin of 2,736 votes, or 0.3%, one of the closest results the state has ever seen in a presidential race, while Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received 4.12% of the vote. Note: Percentages in table do not add up to 100, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number. They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the Southern United States. New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any state in the United States, approximately 18 miles (29 km) long. Other motor racing venues include Star Speedway and New England Dragway in Epping, Lee Speedway in Lee, Twin State Speedway in Claremont, Monadnock Speedway in Winchester and Canaan Fair Speedway in Canaan. The United States Constitution was ratified by New Hampshire on June 21, 1788, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to do so. The New Hampshire State Constitution of 1783 is the supreme law of the state, followed by the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules. New Hampshire's two US senators are Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan (both Democrats), both of whom are former governors. The New Hampshire primary is the first primary in the US presidential election cycle. As of February 5, 2016, there were 882,959 registered voters, of whom 389,472 (44.1%) did not declare a political party affiliation, 262,111 (29.7%) were Republican, and 231,376 (26.2%) were Democratic. The state border is not in the center of that river, as is usually the case, but at the low-water mark on the Vermont side; meaning the entire river along the Vermont border (save for areas where the water level has been raised by a dam) lies within New Hampshire. All but two of these unincorporated areas are in Coos County. The gender makeup of the state was 49.3% male and 50.7% female. New Hampshire was a net exporter of electricity, exporting 63 trillion British thermal units (18 TWh). New Hampshire is an alcoholic beverage control state, and through the State Liquor Commission it takes in $100 million from the sale and distribution of liquor.

GT:
The New Hampshire State Constitution of 1783 is the supreme law of the state, followed by the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules. These are roughly analogous to the federal United States Constitution, United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations respectively. New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senatorte president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world, and 24 senators. Legislators are paid a nominal salary of $200 per year, the lowest in the US by far, thus most are effectively volunteers, nearly half of which are retirees. The state's sole appellate court is the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in civil or criminal cases. The other state courts are the Probate Court, District Court, and the Family Division. New Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns.
