Tennessee is the 36th largest by area and the 16th most populous of the 50 states. It is bordered by eight states, with Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the west, and Missouri to the northwest. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms its western border. What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later part of the Southwest Territory. Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Other sources differ on the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to volunteers for the Mexicanâ€“American War from 1846 to 1848. Tennessee is tied with Missouri as the state bordering the most other states. Middle Tennessee is one of the primary state population and transportation centers along with the heart of state government. It is part of the large geographic land area that begins at the Gulf of Mexico and extends north into southern Illinois. At that time, Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi people. In recent years, Tennessee has received an influx of people relocating from California, Florida, New York, New Jersey and the New England States for the low cost of living, and the booming healthcare and automobile industries. Soybeans are also heavily planted in West Tennessee, focusing on the northwest corner of the state. Tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music, including rock and roll, blues, country, and rockabilly. This may be a result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by Union (Northern) forces of the US government after the American Civil War.
\Predicted Summary:
The Memphis Tigers are members of the American Athletic Conference, and the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders from Murfreesboro play in Conference USA. Tennessee is also a major hub for the automotive industry. In Memphis, the Tennessee Bottoms end in steep bluffs overlooking the river. Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Beginning during Reconstruction, it had competitive party politics, but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disenfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting. The Confederates besieged Chattanooga during the Chattanooga Campaign in early fall 1863, but were driven off by Grant in November. Senatortor from Tennessee, failed to carry his home state, an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,483,356; the United Methodist Church with 375,693; the Roman Catholic Church with 222,343; and the Churches of Christ with 214,118. The Executive Branch also includes several agencies, boards and commissions, some of which are under the auspices of one of the cabinet-level departments. Other major attractions in Nashville include the Tennessee State Museum, Parthenon, and the Belle Meade Plantation. There are sizable reserves of lignite coal in West Tennessee that remain untapped. Despite recognized effects of limiting voting by poor whites, successive legislatures expanded the reach of the disfranchising laws until they covered the state. The tax rate was 6% from 1937 to 2016, but is in the process of being completely phased out by January 1, 2021. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 66,412, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 178,125. These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on lands leased from the Cherokee peoples.

Tennessee ( (listen), locally ), officially the State of Tennessee, is a state in the southeastern United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest by area and the 16th most populous of the 50 states. It is bordered by eight states, with Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the west, and Missouri to the northwest. Nashville is the state's capital and largest city, with a 2019 population of 670,820 and a 2019 metro population of 1,934,317. Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a mountain temperate or humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures. Tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music, including rock and roll, blues, country, and rockabilly. Beale Street in Memphis is considered by many to be the birthplace of the blues, with musicians such as W. C. Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909. Memphis was historically home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s. The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry. Multiple brick-and-mortar museums recognize Tennessee's role in nurturing various forms of popular music: the Memphis Rock N' Soul Museum, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and National Museum of African American Music in Nashville, and the International Rock-A-Billy Museum in Jackson. Moreover, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly in which Tennessee played a crucial role, is based in Nashville. Notable writers with ties to Tennessee include Cormac McCarthy, Peter Taylor, James Agee, Francis Hodgson Burnett, Thomas S. Stribling, Ida B. Wells, Nikki Giovanni, Shelby Foote, Ann Patchett, Ishmael Reed, and Randall Jarrell.
