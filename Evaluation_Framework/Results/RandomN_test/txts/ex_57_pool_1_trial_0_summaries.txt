How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the US federal government, both civilian and military. Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Nevada government are divided among three separate departments: the executive consisting of the governor of Nevada and their cabinet along with the other elected constitutional officers; the legislative consisting of the Nevada Legislature, which includes the Assembly and the Senatorte; and the judicial consisting of the Supreme Court of Nevada and lower courts. The governor is the chief magistrate of Nevada, the head of the executive department of the state's government, and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The Nevada Legislature is a bicameral body divided into an Assembly and Senatorte. Each session of the legislature meets for a constitutionally mandated 120 days in every odd-numbered year, or longer if the governor calls a special session. The Supreme Court of Nevada is the state supreme court and the head of the Nevada Judiciary. Original jurisdiction is divided between the district courts (with general jurisdiction), and justice courts and municipal courts (both of limited jurisdiction). The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. Clark and Washoe counties have long dominated the state's politics. The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno. This gives the state status as a political bellwether.
\Predicted Summary:
Naval Air Station Fallon in Fallon; NSAWC, (pronounced "EN-SOCK") in western Nevada. In the 21st century, the Las Vegas area has become a significant regional center for college basketball conference tournaments. Nevada is the most mountainous state in the contiguous United States. Although prostitution is not a major part of the Nevada economy, employing roughly 300 women as independent contractors, it is a very visible endeavor. In 1883, Washoe County annexed the portion that remained in Nevada. Nevada was annexed as a part of the Spanish Empire in the northwestern territory of New Spain. Before that, it was a part of Arizona Territory. The United States annexed the area in 1848 after its victory in the Mexican–American War, and it was incorporated as part of Utah Territory in 1850. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Jedediah Smith entered the Las Vegas Valley in 1827, and Peter Skene Ogden traveled the Humboldt River in 1828. NSAWC consolidated three Command Centers into a single Command Structure under a flag officer on July 11, 1996. There are also 189 Nevada state routes.

Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Nevada government are divided among three separate departments: the executive consisting of the governor of Nevada and their cabinet along with the other elected constitutional officers; the legislative consisting of the Nevada Legislature, which includes the Assembly and the Senatorte; and the judicial consisting of the Supreme Court of Nevada and lower courts. The governor is the chief magistrate of Nevada, the head of the executive department of the state's government, and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The current governor is Steve Sisolak, a Democrat. The Nevada Legislature is a bicameral body divided into an Assembly and Senatorte. Members of the Assembly serve two years, and members of the Senatorte serve four years. Both houses of the Nevada Legislature will be impacted by term limits starting in 2010, as senators and assemblymen/women will be limited to a maximum of twelve years in each house (by appointment or election which is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the constitution which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court of Nevada in a unanimous decision. Each session of the legislature meets for a constitutionally mandated 120 days in every odd-numbered year, or longer if the governor calls a special session. The Supreme Court of Nevada is the state supreme court and the head of the Nevada Judiciary. Original jurisdiction is divided between the district courts (with general jurisdiction), and justice courts and municipal courts (both of limited jurisdiction). Appeals from District Courts are made directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which under a deflective model of jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the Court of Appeals for final resolution. Town Boards for unincorporated towns are limited local governments created by either the local county commission, or by referendum, and form a purely advisory role and in no way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them.
