The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife, boating, and fisheries regulations outside of state parks. Tennessee is home to several Protestant denominations, such as the National Baptist Convention (headquartered in Nashville); the Church of God in Christ and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (both headquartered in Memphis); the Church of God and The Church of God of Prophecy (both headquartered in Cleveland). An estimated 21–24% of Tennesseans are of predominantly English ancestry. Chattanooga and Knoxville, both in the east near the Great Smoky Mountains, are about a third that size. The frontier fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a 1780 staging area for the Overmountain Men in preparation to trek over the Appalachian Mountains, to engage, and to later defeat the British Army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina. Some accounts suggest it is a Cherokee modification of an earlier Yuchi word. Middle Tennessee was a common destination of settlers crossing the Appalachians from Virginia in the late 18th century and early 19th century.
