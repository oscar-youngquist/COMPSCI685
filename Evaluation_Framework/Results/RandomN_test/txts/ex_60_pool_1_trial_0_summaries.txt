How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state constitution allows no more than two justices of the five-member Tennessee Supreme Court to be from one Grand Division and a similar rule applies to certain commissions and boards. Similar to the United States Federal Government, Tennessee's government has three parts. The governor is the only official who is elected statewide. The governor is supported by 22 cabinet-level departments, most headed by a commissioner who serves at the pleasure of the governor: The bicameral Legislative Branch, known as the Tennessee General Assembly, consists of the 33-member Senatorte and the 99-member House of Representatives. The speaker of the state Senatorte also holds the title of lieutenant governor. Constitutional officials in the legislative branch are elected by a joint session of the legislature. It has a chief justice and four associate justices. A number of local, circuit, and federal courts provide judicial services. The state had two earlier constitutions. It also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties. After decades in which urban populations had been underrepresented in many state legislatures, this significant ruling led to an increased (and proportional) prominence in state politics by urban and, eventually, suburban, legislators and statewide officeholders in relation to their population within the state. Tennessee's Constitution requires that each County have an elected Sheriff. The three counties in Tennessee to adopt metropolitan governments have taken different approaches to resolving the conflict that a Metro government presents to the requirement to have an elected Sheriff.
\Predicted Summary:
Some accounts suggest it is a Cherokee modification of an earlier Yuchi word. From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (Furman v. Georgia) capital punishment unconstitutional, there were no further executions. Mining activities in the basin resulted in a major environmental disaster, which left the landscape in the basin barren for more than a century. Areas under the control and management of the National Park Service include the following: The Trace was called the "North Carolina Road" or "Avery's Trace", and sometimes "The Wilderness Road" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's "Wilderness Road" through the Cumberland Gap). The highest recorded temperature is 113 °F (45 °C) at Perryville on August 9, 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature is −32 °F (−36 °C) at Mountain City on December 30, 1917. Tennessee's Bob Corker was the only freshman Republican elected to the United States Senatorte in the 2006 midterm elections. The Baker v. Carr (1962) decision of the US Supreme Court established the principle of "one man, one vote", requiring state legislatures to redistrict to bring Congressional apportionment in line with decennial censuses. The state averages about fifty days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large hail and damaging winds. The state line between Tennessee and North Carolina crosses the summit. The same year, 22.9% of the power was produced by coal, 20.3% from natural gas, 12.1% from hydroelectric power, and 1.6% from other renewables. The highest point in the state is Clingmans Dome at 6,643 feet (2,025 m). The 1870 Constitution outlaws martial law within its jurisdiction. Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither was ever a federal territory. Memphis was historically home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s.

Similar to the United States Federal Government, Tennessee's government has three parts. The Executive Branch is led by Tennessee's governor, who holds office for a four-year term and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The governor is the only official who is elected statewide. Unlike most states, the state does not elect the lieutenant governor directly; the Tennessee Senatorte elects its Speaker, who serves as lieutenant governor. The governor is supported by 22 cabinet-level departments, most headed by a commissioner who serves at the pleasure of the governor: The Executive Branch also includes several agencies, boards and commissions, some of which are under the auspices of one of the cabinet-level departments. The bicameral Legislative Branch, known as the Tennessee General Assembly, consists of the 33-member Senatorte and the 99-member House of Representatives. Senatortors serve four-year terms, and House members serve two-year terms. Each chamber chooses its own speaker. The speaker of the state Senatorte also holds the title of lieutenant governor. Constitutional officials in the legislative branch are elected by a joint session of the legislature. The highest court in Tennessee is the state Supreme Court. It has a chief justice and four associate justices. No more than two justices can be from the same Grand Division. The Supreme Court of Tennessee also appoints the Attorney General, a practice not found in any of the other 49 states. Both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals have 12 judges. A number of local, circuit, and federal courts provide judicial services. Tennessee sends nine members to the US House of Representatives, of whom there are seven Republicans and two Democrats.
