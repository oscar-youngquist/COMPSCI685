What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
West Virginia was one of only ten states in 2009 that grew economically. Through the first half of 2010, exports from West Virginia topped $3 billion, growing 39.5% over the same period from the previous year and ahead of the national average by 15.7%. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 2014 West Virginia's economy grew twice as fast as the next fastest growing state east of the Mississippi River, ranking third alongside Wyoming and just behind North Dakota and Texas among the fastest growing states in the United States. Tourism contributed $4.27 billion to the state's economy and employed 44,400 people in 2010, making it one of the state's largest industries. One of the major resources in West Virginia's economy is coal. As of 2017, the coal industry accounted for 2% of state employment. West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the Nation in net interstate electricity exports. Farming is also practiced in West Virginia, but on a limited basis because of the mountainous terrain over much of the state. The state's consumer sales tax is levied at 6% on most products except for non-prepared foods. In 2012, West Virginia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.3%. In West Virginia during the same time period, its real GDP increased about 11%, while total employment decreased by 1,000 jobs from 746,000 to 745,000. Personal income growth in West Virginia during 2013 was only 1.5%—the lowest in the nation—and about half the national average (2.6%). Overall income growth in West Virginia in the last thirty years has been only 13%—about a third the national average (37%). West Virginia's poverty rate is one of the highest in the nation. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. This is expected to also help bring economic growth to the southern half of the state.
\Predicted Summary:
The governor, lieutenant governor, the judiciary, sheriffs, and other county officers were to be elected by public vote. In 2014 life expectancy for both sexes in the state was 76.0 years compared to 79.1 years for the United States as a whole. The center also hosts the West Virginia Dance Festival, which features classical and modern dance. Recreational transportation opportunities abound in West Virginia, including hiking trails, rail trails, ATV off-road trails, white water rafting rivers, and two tourist railroads, the Cass Scenic Railroad and the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad. It is still the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use. Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects. This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide. Bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections, and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended. The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) across the state to the new city of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River Coal Field. Saltpeter caves had been employed throughout Appalachia for munitions; the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the "Saltpeter Trail", a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate which were rendered and sold to the government. Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, this would mean the collapse of Shattara-Moneton culture. Nearly half of these caves are on the West Virginia side, including Organ Cave and Haynes Cave. A September 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 19% of West Virginia voters thought same-sex marriage should be legal, while 71% thought it should be illegal and 10% were not sure. During the remainder of the year, monthly interim sessions are held in preparation for the regular session. It is a citizen's legislature, meaning that legislative office is not a full-time occupation, but rather a part-time position. Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost. Slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only $300, a fraction of their true value.

GT:
The net corporate income tax rate is 6.5% while business costs are 13% below the national average. Tourism contributed $4.27 billion to the state's economy and employed 44,400 people in 2010, making it one of the state's largest industries. Canaan Valley is popular for winter sports, Senatorca Rocks is one of the premier rock climbing destinations in the eastern US, the New River Gorge/Fayetteville area draws rock climbers as well as whitewater rafting enthusiasts, and the Monongahela National Forest is popular with hikers, backpackers, hunters, and anglers. In addition to such outdoor recreation opportunities, the state offers a number of historic and cultural attractions. One of the major resources in West Virginia's economy is coal. West Virginia personal income tax is based on federal adjusted gross income (not taxable income), as modified by specific items in West Virginia law. Citizens are taxed within five income brackets, which range from 3.0% to 6.5%. The state's consumer sales tax is levied at 6% on most products except for non-prepared foods. West Virginia counties administer and collect property taxes, although property tax rates reflect levies for state government, county governments, county boards of education and municipalities.
