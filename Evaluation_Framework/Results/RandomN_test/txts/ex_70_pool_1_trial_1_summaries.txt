What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
The economy is primarily based on agriculture, including ranching and cereal grain farming. Other significant economic resources include oil, gas, coal, mining, and lumber. The health care, service, and government sectors also are significant to the state's economy. A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state starting in 1862 found gold, silver, copper, lead, and coal (and later oil) which attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area. Cattle ranching has been central to Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and traded cattle fattened in fertile Montana valleys with emigrants on the Oregon Trail. Operated by the National Park Service, it is a 1,900-acre (7.7 km2) working ranch. The war created a boom for Montana mining, lumber, and farming interests, as demand for war materials and food increased. The wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state a major producer; the wheat has a relatively high protein content, thus commands premium prices. During the first decade of the new century, growth was mainly concentrated in Montana's seven largest counties, with the highest percentage growth in Gallatin County, which had a 32% increase in its population from 2000 to 2010. About 2000–3000 Chinese miners were in the mining areas of Montana by 1870, and 2500 in 1890. As of 2015, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates Montana's state product was $42.6 billion (45th in the nation) and per capita personal income was $41,280 (37th in the nation). Significant industries exist for lumber and mineral extraction; the state's resources include gold, coal, silver, talc, and vermiculite.
\Predicted Summary:
Foothill regions are often covered in weathered stone or broken slate, or consist of uncovered bare rock (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone, or shale). In June 1917, the US Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the Sedition Act of 1918. The amount of property tax owed is not determined solely by the property's value. Ninety percent of its language came from an 1884 constitution which was never acted upon by Congress for national political reasons. According to a study done for the US Environmental Protection Agency by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science, parts of Montana will experience a 200% increase in area burned by wildfires, and an 80% increase in related air pollution. In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the US government, military, or symbols through speech or other means. Wheeler was brought before the Council of Defense, though he avoided formal proceedings, and a district court judge from Forsyth was impeached. In 1941, as she had in 1917, she voted against the United States' declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Massive debt was one. The state's seven reservations include more than 12 distinct Native American ethnolinguistic groups. Neither justices nor the clerk are term limited. Many people left, and half the banks in the state went bankrupt as a result of providing mortgages that could not be repaid. The Pend Oreille River joined the Columbia River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean—making the 579-mile (932 km) long Clark Fork/Pend Oreille (considered a single river system) the longest river in the Rocky Mountains.

GT:
Montana is a relative hub of beer microbrewing, ranking third in the nation in number of craft breweries per capita in 2011. Significant industries exist for lumber and mineral extraction; the state's resources include gold, coal, silver, talc, and vermiculite. Ecotaxes on resource extraction are numerous. A 1974 state severance tax on coal (which varied from 20 to 30%) was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 US 609 (1981). Tourism is also important to the economy, with more than ten million visitors a year to Glacier National Park, Flathead Lake, the Missouri River headwaters, the site of the Battle of Little Bighorn, and three of the five entrances to Yellowstone National Park. However, property taxes are assessed on livestock, farm machinery, heavy equipment, automobiles, trucks, and business equipment.
