Input:
Kansas ( (listen)) is a US state in the Midwestern United States. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. In Kansas alone, there are more than 6,000 ghost towns and dwindling communities, according to one Kansas historian, Daniel C. Fitzgerald. Its attractions include the Kansas Speedway, Sporting Kansas City, Kansas City T-Bones, Schlitterbahn, and The Legends at Village West retail and entertainment center. With a number of nationally registered historic places, museums, and other entertainment destinations, it has a desire to become a cultural mecca in the Midwest. To the southeast of Wichita are the cities of Winfield and Arkansas City with historic architecture and the Cherokee Strip Museum (in Ark City). The rock band Kansas was formed in the state capital of Topeka, the hometown of several of the band's members. Kansas has been the setting of many award-winning and popular American films, as well as being the home of some of the oldest operating cinemas in the world. Both KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball.
