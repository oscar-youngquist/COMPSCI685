Input:
The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch, led by the governor; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Ohio General Assembly; and the judicial branch, led by the state Supreme Court. The state is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections. The state government of Ohio consists of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. The executive branch is headed by the governor of Ohio. The other elected constitutional offices in the executive branch are the secretary of state (Frank LaRose), auditor (Keith Faber), treasurer (Robert Sprague), and attorney general (Dave Yost). There are three levels of the Ohio state judiciary. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected. The Ohio General Assembly is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senatorte and House of Representatives. The governor, Mike DeWine, is Republican, as well as all other non-judicial statewide elected officials, including Lieutenant Governor Jon A. Husted, Attorney General Dave Yost, State Auditor Keith Faber, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and State Treasurer Robert Sprague. In the Ohio State Senatorte the Republicans are the majority, 24–9, and in the Ohio House of Representatives the Republicans control the delegation 61–38.
