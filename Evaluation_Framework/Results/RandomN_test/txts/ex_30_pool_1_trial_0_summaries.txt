What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Poultry, soybeans, and cattle are the state's primary agricultural products, and major manufacturing exports include chemicals, transportation equipment, and electrical equipment. Major outputs for the state include textiles, cotton, cattle, and electrical power. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%, the second-highest in the nation, along with Mississippi, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Indiana. Tourism contributes billions of dollars every year to the state's economy, and Tennessee is ranked among the Top 10 destinations in the nation. In 2014 a record 100 million people visited the state resulting in $17.7 billion in tourism related spending within the state, an increase of 6.3% over 2013; tax revenue from tourism equaled $1.5 billion. Tourism-generated jobs for the state reached 152,900, a 2.8% increase.
\Predicted Summary:
After disenfranchisement of blacks, the Republican Party in Tennessee became a primarily white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state. This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the western Blue Ridge Mountains, which are subdivided into several subranges, namely the Great Smoky Mountains, the Bald Mountains, the Unicoi Mountains, the Unaka Mountains and Roan Highlands, and the Iron Mountains. The state's lowest point is the Mississippi River at the Mississippi state line: 178 feet (54 m). In 2010, approximately 4.4% of Tennessee's population was foreign-born, an increase of about 118.5% since 2000. In February 1861, secessionists in Tennessee's state government—led by Governor Isham Harris—sought voter approval for a convention to sever ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a 54–46% margin. Senatortor from Tennessee, failed to carry his home state, an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support. A branch interstate, I-269 also exists from Millington to Collierville.
