What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Based on 2017 data, it was the second-wealthiest US state by median household income. Hope, Mine Hill and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry. Zinc mines were also a major industry, especially the Sterling Hill Mine. This was the fourth-highest percentage of any state in the country. It is also the second wealthiest state according to the US Census Bureau. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that New Jersey's gross state product in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $639.8 billion. New Jersey's per capita gross state product in 2008 was $54,699, second in the US and above the national per capita gross domestic product of $46,588. New Jersey's economy is multifaceted, but is centered on the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, information technology, the financial industry, chemical development, telecommunications, food processing, electric equipment, printing, publishing, and tourism. New Jersey's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, horses, vegetables, fruits and nuts, seafood, and dairy products. Although New Jersey is home to many energy-intensive industries, its energy consumption is only 2.7% of the US total, and its carbon dioxide emissions are 0.8% of the US total. New Jersey has a strong scientific economy and is home to major pharmaceutical and telecommunications firms, drawing on the state's large and well-educated labor pool. There is also a strong service economy in retail sales, education, and real estate, serving residents who work in New York City or Philadelphia. The state is home to many diner manufacturers and has over 600 diners, more than any other place in the world. (The others are Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Virginia.)
\Predicted Summary:
Transportation was greatly improved as locomotion and steamboats were introduced to New Jersey. The intent of these projects was to encourage transit-oriented development in North Jersey and South Jersey, respectively. Academic Michael Aaron Rockland attributes this to New Yorkers' view that New Jersey is the beginning of Middle America. There were an estimated 550,000 illegal immigrants in the state in 2010. All but one county in New Jersey lie within the combined statistical areas of New York City or Philadelphia; consequently, the state's largest metropolitan area falls within Greater New York. This paradox is most pronounced in Bergen County, New Jersey's most populous county, whose more than 930,000 residents in 2019 inhabited 70 municipalities, the most populous being Hackensack, with 44,522 residents estimated in 2018. In January 2018, Gurbir Grewal became the first Sikh American state attorney general in the United States. Average snowfall per winter season ranges from 10–15 inches (25–38 cm) in the south and near the seacoast, 15–30 inches (38–76 cm) in the northeast and central part of the state, to about 40–50 inches (1.0–1.3 m) in the northwestern highlands, but this often varies considerably from year to year. The ranks were later reorganized and withstood the British charges. This was followed by the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced a Council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs. Secretary of Education Rick Rosenberg, appointed by Governor Jon Corzine, created the Education Advancement Initiative (EAI) to increase college admission rates by 10% for New Jersey's high school students, decrease dropout rates by 15%, and increase the amount of money devoted to schools by 10%. From 1977 to 2012, New Jersey had a National Basketball Association team, the New Jersey Nets. New Jersey is connected to New York City via various key bridges and tunnels. New Jersey is also at the center of the Northeast megalopolis. Forests cover 45%, or approximately 2.1 million acres, of New Jersey's land area.

There is also a strong service economy in retail sales, education, and real estate, serving residents who work in New York City or Philadelphia. Shipping is a key industry in New Jersey because of the state's strategic geographic location, the Port of New York and New Jersey being the busiest port on the East Coast. New Jersey hosts several business headquarters, including twenty-four Fortune 500 companies. This accessibility to consumer revenue has enabled seaside resorts such as Atlantic City and the remainder of the Jersey Shore, as well as the state's other natural and cultural attractions, to contribute significantly to the record 111 million tourist visits to New Jersey in 2018, providing US$44.7 billion in tourism revenue, directly supporting 333,860 jobs, sustaining more than 531,000 jobs overall including peripheral impacts, and generating US$5 billion in state and local tax revenue. Sports betting has become a growing source of gambling revenue in New Jersey since being legalized across the nation by the US Supreme Court on May 14, 2018.
