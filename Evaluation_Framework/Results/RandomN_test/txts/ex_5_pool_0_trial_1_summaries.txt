Input:
It still has a substantial presence in the state. Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches. The Delaware General Assembly consists of a House of Representatives with 41 members and a Senatorte with 21 members. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senatorte confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor. The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts: The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The governor presents a "State of the State" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware including Senatorte and House. New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the legislature Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two statewide offices in 2014, State Auditor and State Treasurer.
\Predicted Summary:
Delaware saw 8.5 million visitors in 2015, with the tourism industry employing 41,730 people, making it the 4th largest private employer in the state. Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 236 is among the most problematic. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area Native American tribes. Following the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state. Delaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened. Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York. The hardiness zones are 7a and 7b. Residents of Sussex County will also use Wicomico Regional Airport (SBY), as it is located less than 10 miles (16 km) from the Delaware border. Delaware's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States. Salisbury's CBS affiliate, WBOC-TV, maintains bureaus in Dover and Milton. Delaware is represented in rugby by the Delaware Black Foxes, a 2015 expansion club. The Delmarva Central Railroad operates the most trackage of the short-line railroads, running from an interchange with Norfolk Southern in Porter south through Dover, Harrington, and Seaford to Delmar, with another line running from Harrington to Frankford and branches from Ellendale to Milton and from Georgetown to Gravel Hill.
