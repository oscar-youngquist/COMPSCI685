\Predicted Summary:
The Big Hole Valley, Bitterroot Valley, Gallatin Valley, Flathead Valley, and Paradise Valley have extensive agricultural resources and multiple opportunities for tourism and recreation. Historically, Republicans are strongest in the east, while Democrats are strongest in the west. The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the US passed the Organic Act. Montana became a United States territory (Montana Territory) on May 26, 1864. In the 2015 United States Census, Montana had the second-highest percentage of US military veterans of another state. Montana also was the training ground for the First Special Service Force or "Devil's Brigade", a joint USCanadian commando-style force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for experience in mountainous and winter conditions before deployment. Temperatures vary greatly on cold nights, and Helena, 40 miles (64 km) to the southeast had a low of only −36 °F or −37.8 °C on the same date, and an all-time record low of −42 °F or −41.1 °C. The western half is mountainous, interrupted by numerous large valleys. Farmers of Irish, Scots, and English roots also settled in Montana. The two men worked up a basic melody and lyrics in about a half-hour for the entertainment of party guests, then finished the song later that evening, with an arrangement worked up the following day. Montana ( (listen)) is a state in the Northwestern United States. Also, most settlers were from wetter regions, unprepared for the dry climate, lack of trees, and scarce water resources.

Under Territorial Governor Thomas Meagher, Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a failed bid for statehood. Many well-known artists, photographers and authors have documented the land, culture and people of Montana in the last 130 years.
