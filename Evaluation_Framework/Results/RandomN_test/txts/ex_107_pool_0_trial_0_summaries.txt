With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including tourism, agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the US in state export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly expanded in Texas and was its largest industry before the beginning of the 20th century. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. As of 2019, Texas had a gross state product (GSP) of $1.9 trillion, the second highest in the US Its GSP is greater than the GDPs of Brazil, Canada, Russia, South Korea and Spain, which are the world's 9th-, 10th-, 11th-, 12th- and 13th-largest economies, respectively. Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California. Texas's large population, an abundance of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers of higher education have contributed to a large and diverse economy. Since oil was discovered, the state's economy has reflected the state of the petroleum industry. In 2010, Site Selection Magazine ranked Texas as the most business-friendly state in the nation, in part because of the state's three-billion-dollar Texas Enterprise Fund. The state also leads the nation in production of cotton which is the number one crop grown in the state in terms of value. Texas has a large commercial fishing industry. Texas's affluence stimulates a strong commercial sector consisting of retail, wholesale, banking and insurance, and construction industries.
