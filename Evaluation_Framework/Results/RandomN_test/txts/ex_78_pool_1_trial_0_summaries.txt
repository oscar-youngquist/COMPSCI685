What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer, with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world. Mining shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see Silver mining in Nevada). From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the US percentage-wise. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent. The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching. Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada.

Native American tribes in Nevada are the Koso, Paiute, Panamint, Shoshoni, Walapi, Washoe and Ute tribes. Most of these animals forage on rangeland in the summer, with supplemental feed in the winter.
