The administration of the state's court system is controlled by the Judicial Council, composed of the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, 14 judicial officers, four representatives from the State Bar of California, and one member from each house of the state legislature. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the Constitution of California, they are the legal subdivisions of the state. Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors.

\Predicted Summary:
Forest floors are covered with swordfern, alumnroot, barrenwort, and trillium, and there are thickets of huckleberry, azalea, elder, and wild currant. There are about 3,400 special districts in California. The Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel, snowshoe hare, and several species of chipmunks. Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world; an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old. The state of California sends 53 members to the House of Representatives, the nation's largest congressional state delegation. The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush. California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere. In total for 2011, there were 277,304 immigrants. Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the "California 100 Company", due to a majority of their members being from California. California is the only US state to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands. Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 27 percent of the population. This variety, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from varieties of AmericanEnglish used in other regions of the United States.

Senatortors serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. California's legal system is explicitly based upon English common law (as is the case with all other states except Louisiana) but carries a few features from Spanish civil law, such as community property. California's judiciary system is the largest in the United States with a total of 1,600 judges (the federal system has only about 840). At the apex is the seven-member Supreme Court of California, while the California Courts of Appeal serve as the primary appellate courts and the California Superior Courts serve as the primary trial courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years. The administration of the state's court system is controlled by the Judicial Council, composed of the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, 14 judicial officers, four representatives from the State Bar of California, and one member from each house of the state legislature. California is divided into 58 counties. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards. Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors. Incorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities. General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. Most small cities have a council–manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly-elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial.
