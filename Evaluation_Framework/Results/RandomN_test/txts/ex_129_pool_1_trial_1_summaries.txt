What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
Idaho is among the few states in the nation without a major freeway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north. US-95 links the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it is badly in need of repair and upgrade. I-84 is the main highway linking the southeast and southwest portions of the state, along with I-86 and I-15. Major federal aid highways in Idaho: Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland, and Spokane to the west, and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east. Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in North Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon. Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop being in Sandpoint. Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho The Union Pacific Railroad also crosses southern Idaho traveling between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls, and Pocatello.
\Predicted Summary:
Several Idaho Republicans, including current Senatortor Mike Crapo, have won reelection to the Senatorte, but only Frank Church has won reelection as a Democrat. The state's southeast incorporates part of the Great Basin. In the 1880s, Republicans became more prominent in local politics. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush carried Idaho by a margin of 38 percentage points and with 68.4% of the vote, winning in 43 of 44 counties. Although the state relies on out-of-state sources for its entire natural gas supply, it uses natural gas-fired plants to generate 127,000 MWh, or about ten percent of its output. Former Vice President, Joe Biden, received roughly 33.6 percent of the votes, which was slightly lower than what was received by former president, Barack Obama. Idaho's climate varies widely. Despite the view that Idaho's bigger cities are "blue islands in a sea of red", as several articles have put it; that was not the case in 2020. In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near present-day Lewiston. The Idaho State Board of Education oversees three comprehensive universities.
