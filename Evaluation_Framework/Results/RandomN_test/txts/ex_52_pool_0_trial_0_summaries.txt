West Virginia is the 41st-largest state by area and ranks 38th in population, with around 1.791 million residents. Most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the Northern panhandle. Located in the Appalachian Mountain range, West Virginia covers an area of 24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km2), with 24,077.73 square miles (62,361.0 km2) of land and 152.03 square miles (393.8 km2) of water, making it the 41st-largest state in the United States. About 75% of the state is within the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions. Only 1.6% of the state's residents were foreign-born, placing West Virginia last among the 50 states in that statistic. West Virginia was one of only ten states in 2009 that grew economically. Through the first half of 2010, exports from West Virginia topped $3 billion, growing 39.5% over the same period from the previous year and ahead of the national average by 15.7%. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 2014 West Virginia's economy grew twice as fast as the next fastest growing state east of the Mississippi River, ranking third alongside Wyoming and just behind North Dakota and Texas among the fastest growing states in the United States. Tourism contributed $4.27 billion to the state's economy and employed 44,400 people in 2010, making it one of the state's largest industries. One of the major resources in West Virginia's economy is coal. West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the Nation in net interstate electricity exports. West Virginia ranked 49th in the 2014 State New Economy Index, and has ranked in the bottom three states since 1999. Overall income growth in West Virginia in the last thirty years has been only 13%—about a third the national average (37%). West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers.
\Predicted Summary:
It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state, the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts, and was one of two states (along with Nevada) admitted to the Union during the American Civil War. The Appalachian Mountains are some of the oldest on earth, having formed more than three hundred million years ago. The West Virginia teachers' strike in 2018 inspired teachers in other states to take similar action. In West Virginia during the same time period, its real GDP increased about 11%, while total employment decreased by 1,000 jobs from 746,000 to 745,000. The theatre was eventually gifted to Marshall University and is currently going through renovation to restore it to its original splendor. In 2014 life expectancy for both sexes in the state was 76.0 years compared to 79.1 years for the United States as a whole. There were 20,928 births in 2006. In 2009–2013, the US real GDP increased 9.6% and total employment increased 3.9%. The proportion of West Virginia's adult population with a bachelor's degree is the lowest in the US at 17.3%. Severe weather is somewhat less prevalent in West Virginia than in most other eastern states, and it ranks among the least tornado-prone states east of the Rockies. As a result, every county west of the Alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution, which nevertheless passed because of eastern support. The convention decided that if Virginians adopted the secession ordinance (of which there was little doubt), another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in Wheeling in June 1861. The Westo did not secure the territory they conquered. The state constitution allows for the creation of an intermediate court of appeals, but the Legislature has never created one. Their railroad was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railroad city was developed at Roanoke to handle planned expansion.

The climate of West Virginia is generally a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa, except Dfb at the higher elevations) with warm to hot, humid summers and chilly winters, increasing in severity with elevation.
