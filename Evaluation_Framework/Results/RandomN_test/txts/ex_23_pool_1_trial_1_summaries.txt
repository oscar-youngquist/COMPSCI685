Input:
The Rocky Mountain Front is a significant feature in the state's north-central portion, and isolated island ranges that interrupt the prairie landscape common in the central and eastern parts of the state. About 60 percent of the state is prairie, part of the northern Great Plains. Vegetation of the state includes lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, larch, spruce, aspen, birch, red cedar, hemlock, ash, alder, rocky mountain maple and cottonwood trees. Forests cover about 25% of the state. These lands are managed by the state for the benefit of public schools and institutions in the state. Montana is a large state with considerable variation in geography, topography and altitude, and the climate is, therefore, equally varied. Montana has a larger Native American population, both numerically and as a percentage, than most US states. Of Montana's 56 counties, Native Americans constitute a majority in three: Big Horn, Glacier, and Roosevelt. Of Montana's 20 largest cities, Polson (15.7%), Havre (13.0%), Great Falls (5.0%), Billings (4.4%), and Anaconda (3.1%) had the greatest percentages of Native American residents in 2010. Significant industries exist for lumber and mineral extraction; the state's resources include gold, coal, silver, talc, and vermiculite. In 1985, the Montana Legislature passed a law allowing towns with fewer than 5,500 residents and unincorporated communities with fewer than 2,500 to levy a resort tax if more than half the community's income came from tourism. This extremely disproportionate ratio of residents paying taxes vs. non-residents using state funded services and infrastructure makes Montana's resort tax crucial in order to safely maintain heavily used roads and highways, as well as protect and preserve state parks. Montana's Senatorte district is the fourth largest by area, behind Alaska, Texas, and California. Collectively all of these areas (excluding Havre) are known informally as the "big seven", as they are consistently the seven largest communities in the state (their rank order in terms of population is Billings, Missoula, Great Falls, Bozeman, Butte, Helena and Kalispell, according to the 2010 US Census). Various community civic groups also played a role in selecting the state grass and the state gemstones.
\Predicted Summary:
Montana and South Dakota are the only states to share a land border which is not traversed by a paved road. The front is often well defined, causing a large temperature drop in a 24-hour period. Ninety percent of its language came from an 1884 constitution which was never acted upon by Congress for national political reasons. The table below lists average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month for Montana's seven largest cities. Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport is the busiest airport in the state of Montana, surpassing Billings Logan International Airport in the spring of 2013. These three communities are the centers of Montana's three Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The largest European ancestry groups in Montana as of 2010 are: German (27.0%), Irish (14.8%), English (12.6%), Norwegian (10.9%), French (4.7%), and Italian (3.4%). The Yellowstone joins the Missouri in North Dakota just east of Fort Union. The Northern Divide turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak, causing the Waterton, Belly, and Saint Mary Rivers to flow north into Alberta. Routes 87, 89, 93 and 191. When so authorized by the legislature, actions of executive branch agencies may be appealed directly to a District Court. Voters approved the legalization of gambling, a bicameral legislature, and retention of the death penalty. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. Many individuals claiming conscientious objector status from throughout the US were sent to Montana during the war as smokejumpers and for other forest fire-fighting duties. The prohibition on speaking German remained in effect into the early 1920s. The taxable value is then multiplied by the mill levy established by various taxing jurisdictionsâ€”city and county government, school districts, and others.

The economy is primarily based on agriculture, including ranching and cereal grain farming. Montana has thousands of named rivers and creeks, 450 miles (720 km) of which are known for "blue-ribbon" trout fishing. Forests cover about 25% of the state. Montana is home to diverse fauna including 14 amphibian, 90 fish, 117 mammal, 20 reptile, and 427 bird species. Since re-introduction the gray wolf population has stabilized at about 900 animals, and they have been delisted as endangered. Montana contains Glacier National Park, "The Crown of the Continent"; and parts of Yellowstone National Park, including three of the park's five entrances. Other federally recognized sites include the Little Bighorn National Monument, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, Big Hole National Battlefield, and the National Bison Range. Montana is a large state with considerable variation in geography, topography and altitude, and the climate is, therefore, equally varied. Snowfall has been recorded in all months of the year in the more mountainous areas of central and western Montana, though it is rare in July and August. Montana has a larger Native American population, both numerically and as a percentage, than most US states. Montana's personal income tax contains seven brackets, with rates ranging from 1.0 to 6.9 percent. Montana has no sales tax*, and household goods are exempt from property taxes. Montana hosts numerous arts and cultural festivals and events every year. Montana provides year-round outdoor recreation opportunities for residents and visitors. Hiking, fishing, hunting, watercraft recreation, camping, golf, cycling, horseback riding, and skiing are popular activities. In 2013, AARP The Magazine named the Billings Clinic one of the safest hospitals in the United States. Montana is ranked as the least obese state in the US, at 19.6%, according to the 2014 Gallup Poll. Elections in the state have been competitive, with the Democrats usually holding an edge, thanks to the support among unionized miners and railroad workers.
