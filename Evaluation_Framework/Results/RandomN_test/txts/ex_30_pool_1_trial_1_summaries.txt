Input:
By the second half of the 1700s, South Carolina was one of the richest of the Thirteen Colonies. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century; and created tourism industries. According to the South Carolina Arts Commission, creative industries generate $9.2 billion annually and support over 78,000 jobs in the state. In 2019, South Carolina's GDP was $249.9 billion, making the state the 26th largest by GDP in the United States. Industrial outputs include textile goods, chemical products, paper products, machinery, automobiles, automotive products and tourism. Major agricultural outputs of the state are tobacco, poultry, cotton, cattle, dairy products, soybeans, hay, rice, and swine. The service sector accounts for 83.7% of the South Carolina economy.
