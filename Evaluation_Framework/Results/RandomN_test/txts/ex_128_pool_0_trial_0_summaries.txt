The main reasons why you would like living in this state

Input:
It is the second largest US state by both area (after Alaska) and population (after California). Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest, and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the US Southern and the Southwestern regions. It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally. The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state. The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather. The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters. Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances. These cities are spread out amongst the state.
\Predicted Summary:
In 1690 Spanish authorities, concerned that France posed a competitive threat, constructed several missions in East Texas. Early Texas settler David B. Edwards described his fellow Texans as being "banished from the pleasures of life". The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety is a law enforcement agency with statewide jurisdiction. As an independent nation, Texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases. Ports employ nearly one-million people and handle an average of 317 million metric tons. Students in Texas take the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in primary and secondary school. Historically, Texas culture comes from a blend of Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. The Jewish population was around 128,000 in 2008. Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas: World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; the colleges took on new roles; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture. Hidalgo County, as of 2011, has the largest number of colonias.

Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest, and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state. It is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all. Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances. Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s °F (26 °C) in the mountains of West Texas and on Galveston Island to around 100 °F (38 °C) in the Rio Grande Valley, but most areas of Texas see consistent summer high temperatures in the 90 °F (32 °C) range. Within the "Big Four" professional leagues, Texas has two NFL teams (the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans), two Major League Baseball teams (the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers), three NBA teams (the San Antonio Spurs, the Houston Rockets, and the Dallas Mavericks), and one National Hockey League team (the Dallas Stars). The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex is one of only twelve American metropolitan areas that host sports teams from all the "Big Four" professional leagues. Texans also enjoy the rodeo. The annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest rodeo in the world. Texas Motor Speedway hosts annual NASCAR Cup Series and IndyCar Series auto races since 1997. Since 2012, Austin's Circuit of the Americas plays host to a round of the Formula 1 World Championship— the first at a permanent road circuit in the United States since the 1980 Grand Prix at Watkins Glen International—, as well as Grand Prix motorcycle racing, FIA World Endurance Championship and United SportsCar Championship races.
