Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California. Texas's large population, an abundance of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers of higher education have contributed to a large and diverse economy.

The state also leads the nation in production of cotton which is the number one crop grown in the state in terms of value. Texas has a large commercial fishing industry.

The final battle of the Civil War was fought near Brownsville, Texas at Palmito Ranch with a Confederate victory. Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches (940 mm) per year. This group forms over 37 percent of Texas's population. A fierce rivalry, the Lone Star Showdown, also exists between the state's two largest universities, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. Both were established by the Texas Constitution and hold stakes in the Permanent University Fund. The term "six flags over Texas" refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory. Historically four major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns.

Texas's large population, an abundance of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers of higher education have contributed to a large and diverse economy. Since oil was discovered, the state's economy has reflected the state of the petroleum industry. Texas has the most farms and the highest acreage in the United States. At $7.4 billion or 56.7 percent of Texas's annual agricultural cash receipts, beef cattle production represents the largest single segment of Texas agriculture. This is followed by cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broilers at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent). Ever since the discovery of oil at Spindletop, energy has been a dominant force politically and economically within the state. Texas has known petroleum deposits of about 5 billion barrels (790,000,000 m3), which makes up about one-fourth of the known US reserves. Several petroleum companies are based in Texas such as: Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Halliburton, Marathon Oil, Tesoro, Valero Energy, and Western Refining. The state is a leader in renewable energy commercialization With large universities systems coupled with initiatives like the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund, a wide array of different high tech industries have developed in Texas. Many high-tech companies are located in or have their headquarters in Texas (and Austin in particular), including Dell, Inc., Borland, Forcepoint, Indeed.com, Texas Instruments, Perot Systems, Rackspace and AT&T. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (NASA JSC) in Southeast Houston, sits as the crown jewel of Texas's aeronautics industry. Texas's affluence stimulates a strong commercial sector consisting of retail, wholesale, banking and insurance, and construction industries. Mexico, the state's largest trading partner, imports a third of the state's exports because of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
