\Predicted Summary:
The two US As with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes. Iowa is the nation's largest producer of ethanol and corn and some years is the largest grower of soybeans. Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri, Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg, Iuka, and Corinth. The Iowa Great Lakes is made up of multiple small towns, such as Spirit Lake, Arnolds Park, Milford, and Okoboji. However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing de facto discrimination to continue. The five largest ancestry groups were: German (35.1%), Irish (13.5%), English (8.2%), American (5.8%), and Norwegian (5.0%). Endangered or threatened plants include western prairie fringed orchid, eastern prairie fringed orchid, Mead's milkweed, prairie bush clover, and northern wild monkshood. A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison that surrendered much of Illinois to the US enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War. No other language is spoken by more than 0.5 percent of the Iowa population. However, in contrast to the unprecidented act of the Iowa Legislature, the United States Federal Government, through the use of Treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk from Iowa in 1848, and forced the Dakota from Iowa by 1858.
