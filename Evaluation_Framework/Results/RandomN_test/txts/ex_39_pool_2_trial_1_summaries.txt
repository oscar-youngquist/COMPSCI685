\Predicted Summary:
Washington has the largest Pacific Northwest population, followed by Oregon, then Idaho. While there are some viticultural activities in the cooler, wetter western half of the state, almost all (99%) of wine grape production takes place in the desert-like eastern half. The La Niña phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average. Washington produces seven principal varieties of apples which are exported to more than sixty countries. The creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 established the final eastern border. The act was mostly repealed in 1995 before it could go into full effect. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48 °F (−44 °C) in Winthrop and Mazama. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) is the major commercial airport of greater Seattle.
