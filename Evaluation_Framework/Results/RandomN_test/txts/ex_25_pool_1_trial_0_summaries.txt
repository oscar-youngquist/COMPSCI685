Input:
Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 19th-least populous, but the 9th-least densely populated of the US states. About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the US federal government, both civilian and military. Much of the northern part of the state is within the Great Basin, a mild desert that experiences hot temperatures in the summer and cold temperatures in the winter. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Nevada is the most mountainous state in the contiguous United States. Nevada is the driest state in the United States. The vegetation of Nevada is diverse and differs by state area. Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the US percentage-wise. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation. Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the top 20 fastest-growing US cities with populations over 100,000. The state's per capita personal income in 2018 was $43,820, ranking 35th in the nation. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. With the advent of air conditioning for summertime use and Southern Nevada's mild winters, the fortunes of the state began to turn around, as it did for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growing in the Union. Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. The more rural counties of the north are among the most conservative regions of the country. The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations.
\Predicted Summary:
Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Nevada is almost entirely within the Basin and Range Province and is broken up by many north–south mountain ranges. The first Europeans to explore the region were Spanish. Jedediah Smith entered the Las Vegas Valley in 1827, and Peter Skene Ogden traveled the Humboldt River in 1828. By the late 20th century, many immigrants from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam came to the Las Vegas metropolitan area. 1 back to back (1989–90, 1990–91). As part of the Mexican Cession (1848) and the subsequent California Gold Rush that used Emigrant Trails through the area, the state's area evolved first as part of the Utah Territory, then the Nevada Territory (March 2, 1861; named for the Sierra Nevada). Nevada achieved its current southern boundaries on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the portion of Pah-Ute County in the Arizona Territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of present-day Nevada south of the 37th parallel. Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. The area formed part of Alta California's territory within the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which gained independence as Mexico in 1821. The Supreme Court of Nevada is the state supreme court and the head of the Nevada Judiciary. A complete listing of crime data in the state for 2013 can be found here: The Nevada state parks comprise protected areas managed by the state of Nevada, including state parks, state historic sites, and state recreation areas. In Douglas, Mineral, and Pershing counties, a plurality of residents are of Mexican ancestry. State Assemblyman Harry Mortenson proposed a bill to recognize the alternate (quasi-Spanish) pronunciation of Nevada, though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote. The most rain that falls in the state falls on the lee side (east and northeast slopes) of the Sierra Nevada. In 1866 another part of the western Utah Territory was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state, setting the current eastern boundary. In 1980, non-Hispanic whites made up 83.3% of the state's population. Nevada has 172 mountain summits with 2,000 feet (610 m) of prominence.

The average annual rainfall per year is about 7 inches (180 mm); the wettest parts get around 40 inches (1,000 mm). The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching. Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates Nevada's total state product in 2018 was $170 billion. The state's per capita personal income in 2018 was $43,820, ranking 35th in the nation. "[Nevada was] founded on mining and refounded on sin – beginning with prizefighting and easy divorce a century ago and later extending to gaming and prostitution", said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist. Nevada has had a thriving solar energy sector. An independent study in 2013 concluded that solar users created a $36 million net benefit. Nevada's tax laws are intended to draw new residents and businesses to the state. Nevada has no personal income tax or corporate income tax. Nevada has very liberal alcohol laws. Bars are permitted to remain open 24 hours, with no "last call". Liquor stores, convenience stores and supermarkets may also sell alcohol 24 hours per day and may sell beer, wine and spirits.
