How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Like the federal government and all other US states, Colorado's state constitution provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches. The Governor of Colorado heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is Jared Polis, a Democrat. Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the Lieutenant Governor of Colorado (elected on a ticket with the Governor), Secretary of State of Colorado, Colorado State Treasurer, and Attorney General of Colorado, all of whom serve four-year terms. The seven-member Colorado Supreme Court is the state's highest court, with seven justices. The Colorado Court of Appeals, with 22 judges, sits in divisions of three judges each. Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction. The state also has a water court, which sits in seven distinct divisions around the state and which decides matters relating to water rights and the use and administration of water. The state legislative body is the Colorado General Assembly, which is made up of two houses - the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. The House has 65 members and the Senatorte has 35. Coloradans have elected 17 Democrats and 12 Republicans to the governorship in the last 100 years.
\Predicted Summary:
Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the Democratic Party met in Denver in 1908. In southmost Colorado is the large San Luis Valley, where the headwaters of the Rio Grande are located. The Colorado Mineral Belt, stretching from the San Juan Mountains in the southwest to Boulder and Central City on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014. The Ute Nation inhabited the mountain valleys of the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Western Rocky Mountains, even as far east as the Front Range of present day. Colorado's marijuana industry sold $1.31 billion worth of marijuana in 2016 and $1.26 billion in the first three-quarters of 2017. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the Confederacy, the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the Union cause. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between free soil and pro-slavery factions. The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state, such as the Hayman Fire of 2002. The Food & Wine Classic is held annually each June in Aspen, Colorado. In percentages, Colorado has the 6th-highest percentage of Mexican-Americans, behind New Mexico, California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada. Colorado is a comparatively wealthy state, ranking 8th in household income in 2016, and 11th in per capita income in 2010.
