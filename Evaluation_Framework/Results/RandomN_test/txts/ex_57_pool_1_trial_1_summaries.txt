Input:
In 1992, voters approved a constitutional amendment implementing term limits for certain statewide elected executive branch offices (governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state auditor, attorney general, superintendent of public instruction) and for members of the Montana Legislature. Montana has three branches of state government: legislative, executive, and judicial. The executive branch is headed by an elected governor. There are also nine other statewide elected offices in the executive branch: Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Auditor (who also serves as Commissioner of Securities and Insurance), and Superintendent of Public Instruction. The Montana Legislature is bicameral, and consists of the 50-member Montana Senatorte and the 100-member Montana House of Representatives. Senatortors serve four-year terms, while Representatives serve two-year terms. The clerk of the Supreme Court is also an elected position, and serves a six-year term. When so authorized by the legislature, actions of executive branch agencies may be appealed directly to a District Court. District Court judges are elected, and serve six-year terms. They are overseen by District Court judges. It has a single judge, appointed by the governor. The US Constitution provides each state with two senators. The US Constitution provides each state with a single representative, with additional representatives apportioned based on population. The state Senatorte is, as of 2019, controlled by the Republicans 32 to 18, and the State House of Representatives at 59 to 41.
\Predicted Summary:
The Rocky Mountain Front is a significant feature in the state's north-central portion, and isolated island ranges that interrupt the prairie landscape common in the central and eastern parts of the state. The first constitution was drafted by a constitutional convention in 1889, in preparation for statehood. It borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east. James Willard Schultz ("Apikuni") from Browning is most noted for his prolific stories about Blackfeet life and his contributions to the naming of prominent features in Glacier National Park. Montana also claims the disputed title of possessing the world's shortest river, the Roe River, just outside Great Falls. Of Montana's 20 largest cities, Polson (15.7%), Havre (13.0%), Great Falls (5.0%), Billings (4.4%), and Anaconda (3.1%) had the greatest percentages of Native American residents in 2010. Flowers native to Montana include asters, bitterroots, daisies, lupins, poppies, primroses, columbine, lilies, orchids, and dryads. Montana hosts numerous arts and cultural festivals and events every year. In addition to cross-country trails at most of the downhill ski areas, there are also 13 private cross-country skiing resorts. In 1914, Montana granted women the vote. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks manages fishing and hunting seasons for at least 17 species of game fish, including seven species of trout, walleye, and smallmouth bass and at least 29 species of game birds and animals including ring-neck pheasant, grey partridge, elk, pronghorn antelope, mule deer, whitetail deer, gray wolf, and bighorn sheep. Eastern Montana comprises plains and badlands, broken by hills and isolated mountain ranges, and has a semiarid, continental climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification BSk). The treaty was ratified in 1859. As World War I broke out, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States' declaration of war.
