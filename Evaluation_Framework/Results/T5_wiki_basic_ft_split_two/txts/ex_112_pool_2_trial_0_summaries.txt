Input:
By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a humid continental climate, with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of California and Arizona. Kansas's record high of 121 °F (49.4 °C) ties with North Dakota for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California (134 °F or 56.7 °C), Arizona (128 °F or 53.3 °C), Nevada (125 °F or 51.7 °C), and New Mexico (122 °F or 50 °C). The cities of Olathe, Shawnee, De Soto and Gardner have some of the state's fastest growing populations. By far, the most significant agricultural crop in the state is wheat. The state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Kansas also has the country's third largest state highway system after Texas and California. Since the mid-20th century, Kansas has remained one of the most socially conservative states in the nation.
