What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Numerous mills were located along various rivers in the state, especially the Merrimack and Connecticut rivers. Manufacturing centers such as Manchester, Nashua and Berlin were hit hard in the 1930sâ€“1940s as major manufacturing industries left New England and moved to the Southern United States or overseas, reflecting nationwide trends. It is the state with the highest percentage of timberland area in the country. It contains less than 5% of the state's population, suffers relatively high poverty, and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. Its agricultural outputs are dairy products, nursery stock, cattle, apples and eggs. Its industrial outputs are machinery, electric equipment, rubber and plastic products, and tourism is a major component of the economy. Today, of the state's total manufacturing dollar value, these sectors contribute only two percent for textiles, two percent for leather goods, and nine percent for machining. The state's largest economic sectors in 2018, based on contribution to GDP, are: 15% real estate and rental and leasing; 13% professional business services; 12% manufacturing; 10% government and government services; and 9% health care and social services. Efforts to diversify the state's general economy have been ongoing.
