South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska and New Mexico. The growth in these areas has compensated for losses in the rest of the state. The service industry is the largest economic contributor in South Dakota. Government spending is another important segment of the state's economy, providing over ten percent of the gross state product. Agriculture has historically been a key component of the South Dakota economy.
