By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. Kansas's record high of 121 °F (49.4 °C) ties with North Dakota for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California (134 °F or 56.7 °C), Arizona (128 °F or 53.3 °C), Nevada (125 °F or 51.7 °C), and New Mexico (122 °F or 50 °C). Out of all the cities in these Midwestern states, 89% have fewer than 3,000 people, and hundreds of those have fewer than 1,000. The cities of Olathe, Shawnee, De Soto and Gardner have some of the state's fastest growing populations. Among cities with at least one thousand residents, Mission Hills has the highest median income in the state. By far, the most significant agricultural crop in the state is wheat. Kansas is ranked eighth in US petroleum production. Kansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. The state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%—above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992.
