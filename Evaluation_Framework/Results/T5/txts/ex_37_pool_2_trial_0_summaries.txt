Arkansas () is a state in the south central United States, home to more than three million people as of 2018. Its name is from the Osage language, of Siouan derivation; it denoted their related kin, the Quapaw people. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which make up the US Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta. Arkansas is the 29th largest by area and the 33rd most populous US state. The capital and most populous city is Little Rock, in the central part of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The Territory of Arkansas was admitted to the Union as the 25th state on June 15, 1836. The name Arkansas initially applied to the Arkansas River. It derives from a French term, Arcansas, their plural term for their transliteration of akansa, an Algonquian term for the Quapaw people. Arkansas can generally be split into two halves, the highlands in the northwest and the lowlands of the southeast. Major tributaries to the Mississippi River include the Arkansas River, the White River, and the St. Francis River. Arkansas generally has a humid subtropical climate. The state's gross domestic product (GDP) was $119 billion in 2015. Six Fortune 500 companies are based in Arkansas, including the world's #1 retailer, Walmart; Tyson Foods, J.B. Hunt, Dillard's, Murphy USA, and Windstream are also headquartered in the state. The culture of Arkansas includes distinct cuisine, dialect, and traditional festivals. Arkansas features a variety of native music across the state, ranging from the blues heritage of West Memphis, Pine Bluff, Helenaâ€“West Helena to rockabilly, bluegrass, and folk music from the Ozarks. The Arkansas Clean Indoor Air Act, a statewide smoking ban excluding bars and some restaurants, went into effect in 2006.
