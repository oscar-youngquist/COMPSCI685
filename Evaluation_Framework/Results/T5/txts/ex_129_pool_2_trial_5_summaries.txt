Georgia recognizes all local units of government as cities, so every incorporated town is legally a city. For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly. In presidential elections, Georgia voted solely Democratic in every election from 1900 to 1960.
