The education proposal succeeded, but the convention tabled the slavery proposals before finishing its work on February 18, 1862. West Virginia counties administer and collect property taxes, although property tax rates reflect levies for state government, county governments, county boards of education and municipalities. The primary beneficiaries of the property tax are county boards of education. The West Virginia legislature sets the rate of tax of county boards of education. This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide. The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities: state, county, schools and municipal. This total tax rate varies for each of the four classes of property, which consists of personal, real and intangible properties.
