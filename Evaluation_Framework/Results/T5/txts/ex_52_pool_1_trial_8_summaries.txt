GT:
The state supports a network of public universities and colleges, including two major university systems: Arkansas State University System and University of Arkansas System. In the 1920s the state required all children to attend public schools. The school year was set at 131 days, although some areas were unable to meet that requirement. Generally prohibited in the West at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in Arkansas, with 20,083 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011â€“12 school year. The state's educational system has a history of underfunding, low teachers' salaries and political meddling in the curriculum. Through reforms, the state is a leader in requiring curricula designed to prepare students for postsecondary education, rewarding teachers for student achievement, and providing incentives for principals who work in lower-tier schools.
