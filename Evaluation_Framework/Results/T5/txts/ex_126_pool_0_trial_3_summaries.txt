South Carolina ( (listen)) is a state in the Deep South region of the Southern United States. South Carolina is the 40th most extensive and 23rd most populous US state. South Carolina was named in honor of King Charles I of England, who first formed the English colony, with Carolus being Latin for "Charles". The state can be divided into three natural geographic areas which then can be subdivided into five distinct cultural regions. South Carolina has several major lakes covering over 683 square miles (1,770 km2). South Carolina averages 10–15 earthquakes a year below magnitude 3 (FEMA). South Carolina has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), although high-elevation areas in the Upstate area have fewer subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline. South Carolina is also prone to tropical cyclones and tornadoes. The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October, during the Cape Verde hurricane season. The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of South Carolina was 5,148,714 on July 1, 2019, an 11.31 percentage increase since the 2010 census. As of the 2017 census estimate, the racial make up of the state is 68.5% White (63.8% non-Hispanic white), 27.3% Black or African American, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.7% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 1.9% from two or more races. There is evidence of human activity in the area dating to about 40,000 years ago. At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end of the Pre-Columbian era around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba, with the total population being up to 20,000. The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States. By the second half of the 1700s, South Carolina was one of the richest of the Thirteen Colonies. In February, 1778, South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, the initial governing document of the United States, and in May 1788, South Carolina ratified the United States Constitution, becoming the eighth state to enter the union. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA), in 2010, the largest religion is Christianity, of which the largest denominations were the Southern Baptist Convention with 913,763 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 274,111 adherents, and the Roman Catholic Church with 181,743 adherents. In 2019, South Carolina's GDP was $249.9 billion, making the state the 26th largest by GDP in the United States.
