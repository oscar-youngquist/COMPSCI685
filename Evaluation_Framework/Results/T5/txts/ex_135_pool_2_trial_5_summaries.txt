Iowa was one of the leading states in the high school movement, and continues to be among the top educational performers today. The four-year graduation rate for high schoolers was 91.3% in 2017. As of 2015 transportation spending is a significant part of the budgets of rural school districts as many are geographically large and must transport students across vast distances. The Iowa Board of Regents is composed of nine citizen volunteers appointed by the governor to provide policymaking, coordination, and oversight of the state's three public universities, two special Kâ€“12 schools, and affiliated centers. Both Iowa State University and The University of Iowa are research universities and members of the prestigious Association of American Universities. In addition to the three state universities, Iowa has multiple private colleges and universities.
