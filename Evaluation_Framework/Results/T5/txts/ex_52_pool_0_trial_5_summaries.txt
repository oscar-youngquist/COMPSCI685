The Michigan State Normal School, now Eastern Michigan University, was founded in 1849, for the training of teachers. Cities, state universities, and villages are vested with home rule powers of varying degrees. The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. The state has maintained its early commitment to public education.
