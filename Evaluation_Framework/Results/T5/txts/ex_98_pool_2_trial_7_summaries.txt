Around 900 CE, a Mississippian culture took root in western and central Kentucky; by contrast, a Fort Ancient culture appeared in eastern Kentucky. In about the 10th century, the Kentucky native people's variety of corn became highly productive, supplanting the Eastern Agricultural Complex, and replaced it with a maize-based agriculture in the Mississippian era. French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the Beaver Wars in the 1670s; however, by the time that European colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region. During a period known as the Beaver Wars, 1640â€“1680, another Algonquian tribe called the Maumee, or Mascouten was chased out of southern Michigan. Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle was a French explorer who claimed all of the land along the Mississippi River Valley, including Kentucky, for France. In 1774 James Harrod founded the first permanent European settlement in Kentucky at the site of present-day Harrodsburg. Kentucky officially became the fifteenth state in the Union on June 1, 1792. Though Kentucky was represented by the central star on the Confederate battle flag, it remained officially "neutral" throughout the war due to the Union sympathies of a majority of the Commonwealth's citizens. Goebel is the only governor of a US state to have been assassinated while in office. The Black Patch Tobacco Wars, a vigilante action, occurred in Western Kentucky in the early 20th century. On October 15, 1959, a B-52 carrying two nuclear weapons collided in midair with a KC-135 tanker near Hardinsburg, Kentucky.
