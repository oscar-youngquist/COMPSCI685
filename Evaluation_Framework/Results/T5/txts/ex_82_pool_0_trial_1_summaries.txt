It is home to the world's longest cave system: Mammoth Cave National Park, as well as the greatest length of navigable waterways and streams in the contiguous United States and the two largest man-made lakes east of the Mississippi River. The state is also known for horse racing, bourbon, moonshine, coal, "My Old Kentucky Home" historic state park, automobile manufacturing, tobacco, bluegrass music, college basketball, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the Kentucky colonel. Kentucky is the only US state to have a continuous border of rivers running along three of its sides â€“ the Mississippi River to the west, the Ohio River to the north, and the Big Sandy River and Tug Fork to the east. The Black Patch Tobacco Wars, a vigilante action, occurred in Western Kentucky in the early 20th century. On October 15, 1959, a B-52 carrying two nuclear weapons collided in midair with a KC-135 tanker near Hardinsburg, Kentucky.

The distinction of being named a Kentucky colonel is the highest title of honor bestowed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
