In addition to I-95, there are six US highways that serve Delaware: US 9, US 13, US 40, US 113, US 202, and US 301. Amtrak has two stations in Delaware along the Northeast Corridor; the relatively quiet Newark Rail Station in Newark, and the busier Wilmington Rail Station in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line of Regional Rail, which serves Claymont, Wilmington, Churchmans Crossing, and Newark. Multiple short-line railroads provide freight service in Delaware. The Delmarva Central Railroad operates the most trackage of the short-line railroads, running from an interchange with Norfolk Southern in Porter south through Dover, Harrington, and Seaford to Delmar, with another line running from Harrington to Frankford and branches from Ellendale to Milton and from Georgetown to Gravel Hill. Therefore, Delaware commercial airline passengers most frequently use Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Other general aviation airports in Delaware include Summit Airport near Middletown, Delaware Airpark near Cheswold, and Delaware Coastal Airport near Georgetown.

One major branch of the US Interstate Highway System, Interstate 95 (I-95), crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across New Castle County. In addition to I-95, there are six US highways that serve Delaware: US 9, US 13, US 40, US 113, US 202, and US 301. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include DE 1, DE 9, and DE 404. A bicycle route, Delaware Bicycle Route 1, spans the northâ€“south length of the state from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island to the Pennsylvania border north of Montchanin. Delaware has about 1,450 bridges, 95 percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT. Three ferries operate in the state of Delaware: Amtrak has two stations in Delaware along the Northeast Corridor; the relatively quiet Newark Rail Station in Newark, and the busier Wilmington Rail Station in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line of Regional Rail, which serves Claymont, Wilmington, Churchmans Crossing, and Newark. Two Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, provide freight rail service in northern New Castle County. The DART First State public transportation system was named "Most Outstanding Public Transportation System" in 2003 by the American Public Transportation Association.
