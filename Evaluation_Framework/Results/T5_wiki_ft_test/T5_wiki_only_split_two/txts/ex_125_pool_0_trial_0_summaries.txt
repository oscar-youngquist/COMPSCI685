Intent:
How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senatorte president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties. The legislature is called the General Court. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world, and 24 senators. The other state courts are the Probate Court, District Court, and the Family Division. New Hampshire is a "Dillon Rule" state, meaning the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities. Most towns generally operate on the town meeting form of government, where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature, and a board of selectmen acts as the executive of the town. Larger towns and the state's thirteen cities operate either on a council–manager or council–mayor form of government. All state-level statutes treat all municipalities identically. Nominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate primary election. The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senatorte, a first for any legislative body in the United States. Further, the state elected its second female governor: Democrat Maggie Hassan. Republicans control the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature, a governing trifecta in which the Republicans have full governing power. In the 116th United States Congress, it is one of only eight states with an entirely Democratic delegation, five of which are in New England (the others are Delaware, Hawaii, and New Mexico).

These are roughly analogous to the federal United States Constitution, United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations respectively. New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senatorte president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties.

The Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in civil or criminal cases. The other state courts are the Probate Court, District Court, and the Family Division. New Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns.
