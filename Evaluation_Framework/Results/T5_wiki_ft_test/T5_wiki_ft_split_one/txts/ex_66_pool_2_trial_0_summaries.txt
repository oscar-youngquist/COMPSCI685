Input:
New Mexico's latitude and low passes made it an attractive east–west transportation corridor. Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of highways and airports. Today, New Mexico's Interstate Highways approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads. Interstate 10 travels in the southwest portion of New Mexico starting from the Arizona stateline near Lordsburg to the area in between Las Cruces and Anthony, near El Paso, Texas. New Mexico currently has 15 United States Highways. The former number has increased with the upgrading of roads near Pojoaque, Santa Fe and Las Cruces to freeways.

Combined, they operate 2,200 route miles of railway in the state. A commuter rail operation, the New Mexico Rail Runner Express, connects the state's capital, its largest city, and other communities. Passenger train service once connected nine of New Mexico's present ten most populous cities (the exception is Rio Rancho), while today passenger train service connects two: Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Front Range Commuter Rail is a project to connect Wyoming and New Mexico with high-speed rail. Amtrak's Southwest Chief passes through daily at stations in Gallup, Albuquerque, Lamy, Las Vegas, and Raton, offering connections to Los Angeles, Chicago and intermediate points.

The pre-Columbian trade with Mesoamerican cultures included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper. Turquoise, pottery, and salt were some of the goods transported south along the Rio Grande. The north–south trade route later became a path for colonists with horses arriving from New Spain as well as trade and communication. The Santa Fe Trail was the 19th-century territory's vital commercial and military highway link to the Eastern United States. New Mexico's latitude and low passes made it an attractive east–west transportation corridor. As a territory, the Gadsden Purchase increased New Mexico's land area for the purpose of the constructing a southern transcontinental railroad, that of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
