What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. The boom and bust economy of mining also left hundreds of ghost towns across the territory, but copper mining continued to prosper with the territory producing more copper than any other state by 1907, which earned Arizona the nickname "the Copper State" at the time of statehood. The state continues to produce half of the nation's newly mined copper. Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors. Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see Copper mining in Arizona), cotton, cattle, citrus, and climate (tourism).
