How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state government consists of three separate branches: judicial, executive, and legislative. The legislature enacts bills, which, if signed by the governor, become law. The Florida Legislature comprises the Florida Senatorte, which has 40 members, and the Florida House of Representatives, which has 120 members. The current governor of Florida is Ron DeSantis.The Florida Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and six justices. In 1970, Democrats took the governorship and the open US Senatorte seat, and maintained dominance for years. Because of this, the area has consistently voted as one of the most Democratic areas of the state. Reapportionment following the 2010 United States Census gave the state two more seats in the House of Representatives. The political make-up of congressional and legislative districts has enabled Republicans to control the governorship and most statewide elective offices, and 17 of the state's 27 seats in the 2012 House of Representatives. In the 2010 elections, Republicans solidified their dominance statewide, by winning the governor's mansion, and maintaining firm majorities in both houses of the state legislature. These have become known as the Fair District Amendments. Each school district has an elected Board of Education that sets policy, budget, goals, and approves expenditures.
