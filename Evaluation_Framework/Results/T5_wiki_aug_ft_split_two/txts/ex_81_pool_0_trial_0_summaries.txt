The constitution may be amended by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative. The Governor of South Dakota occupies the executive branch of the state government. The state constitution gives the governor the power to sign into law or veto bills passed by the state legislature, to serve as commander-in-chief of the South Dakota National Guard, to appoint a cabinet, and to commute criminal sentences or to pardon those convicted of crimes. The governor serves for a four-year term, and may not serve more than two consecutive terms. The state legislature is made up of two bodies, the Senatorte, which has 35 members, and the House of Representatives, with 70 members. South Dakota is divided into 35 legislative districts, with voters electing two representatives and one senator per district. The legislature meets for an annual session which begins on the second Tuesday in January and lasts for 30 days The judicial branch is made up of several levels.
