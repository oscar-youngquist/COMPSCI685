Maine is the 12th-smallest by area, the 9th-least populous, and the 13th-least densely populated of the 50 US states. It is also the northeasternmost among the contiguous United States, the northernmost state east of the Great Lakes, and the only state to border only one other state. There is a humid continental climate throughout most of the state, including coastal areas. Maine is the northernmost state in New England and the largest, accounting for almost half of the region's entire land area. It is called the Pine Tree State; over 80% of its total land is forested or unclaimed, the most forest cover of any US state. The Northwest Aroostook, Maine unorganized territory in the northern part of the state, for example, has an area of 2,668 square miles (6,910 km2) and a population of 10, or one person for every 267 square miles (690 km2). Maine is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. The land near the southern and central Atlantic coast is covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests. The remainder of the state, including the North Woods, is covered by the New England-Acadian forests. Inland are lakes, rivers, forests, and mountains. The state's population density is 41.3 people per square mile, making it the least densely populated state east of the Mississippi River. As of 2010, Maine was also the most rural state in the Union, with only 38.7% of the state's population living within urban areas. As explained in detail under "Geography", there are large tracts of uninhabited land in some remote parts of the interior of the state, particularly in the North Maine Woods. The modest population growth in the state has been concentrated in the southern coastal counties However, the northern, more rural areas of the state have experienced a slight decline in population in recent years. The state is a popular destination for sport hunting (particularly deer, moose and bear), sport fishing, snowmobiling, skiing, boating, camping and hiking, among other activities. The UT land area is slightly over half the entire area of the State of Maine. Adapted from the Maine facts site.

GT:
Maine is known for its jagged, rocky coastline; low, rolling mountains; heavily forested interior; picturesque waterways; and its seafood cuisine, especially lobster and clams. Maine is the least densely populated US state east of the Mississippi River. It is called the Pine Tree State; over 80% of its total land is forested or unclaimed, the most forest cover of any US state. In the wooded areas of the interior lies much uninhabited land, some of which does not have formal political organization into local units (a rarity in New England). The land near the southern and central Atlantic coast is covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests. The remainder of the state, including the North Woods, is covered by the New England-Acadian forests. Maine has almost 230 miles (400 km) of coastline (and 3,500 miles (5,600 km) of tidal coastline). Along the famous rock-bound coast of Maine are lighthouses, beaches, fishing villages, and thousands of offshore islands, including the Isles of Shoals which straddle the New Hampshire border. There are jagged rocks and cliffs and many bays and inlets. Inland are lakes, rivers, forests, and mountains. This visual contrast of forested slopes sweeping down to the sea has been summed up by American poet Edna St. Vincent Millay of Rockland and Camden, Maine, in "Renascence": As explained in detail under "Geography", there are large tracts of uninhabited land in some remote parts of the interior of the state, particularly in the North Maine Woods. In 2010, a study named Maine as the least religious state in the United States. Maine state politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, are noted for having more moderate views than many in the national wings of their respective parties.
