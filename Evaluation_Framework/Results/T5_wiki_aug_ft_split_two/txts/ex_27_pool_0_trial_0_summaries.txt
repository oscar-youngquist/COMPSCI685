How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Like all other US states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive branch consisting of the governor of Alaska and his or her appointees which head executive departments; a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senatorte; and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts. The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senatorte. The lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries, but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket. Alaska's court system has four levels: the Alaska Supreme Court, the Alaska Court of Appeals, the superior courts and the district courts. The superior and district courts are trial courts. The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are appellate courts. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division. Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State Recorder. Whereas many US states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city–county.

Alaska's court system has four levels: the Alaska Supreme Court, the Alaska Court of Appeals, the superior courts and the district courts. The superior and district courts are trial courts. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts hear only certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000. The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are appellate courts. The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and habeas corpus. Whereas many US states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough.
