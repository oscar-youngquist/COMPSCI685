What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. Hohokam, Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloan cultures were among those that flourished throughout the state. The Southern territory supplied the Confederate government with men, horses, and equipment. The boom and bust economy of mining also left hundreds of ghost towns across the territory, but copper mining continued to prosper with the territory producing more copper than any other state by 1907, which earned Arizona the nickname "the Copper State" at the time of statehood. Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression. But during the 1920s and even the 1930s, tourism began to develop as the important Arizonan industry it is today. Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. Tucson, with a metro population of just over one million, is the state's second-largest city. With 212,635 residents, this cluster of towns is the state's third largest metropolitan area. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors. Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see Copper mining in Arizona), cotton, cattle, citrus, and climate (tourism). Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output. Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there.
