Average annual precipitation in South Dakota ranges from semi-arid conditions in the northwestern part of the state (around 15 inches or 380 mm) to semi-humid around the southeast portion of the state (around 25 inches or 640 mm), although a small area centered on Lead in the Black Hills has the highest precipitation at nearly 30 inches (760 mm) per year. The tourism industry has grown considerably since the completion of the interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska and New Mexico. Government spending is another important segment of the state's economy, providing over ten percent of the gross state product. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas.
