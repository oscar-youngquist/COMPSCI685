What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
By 1860, Mississippi was the nation's top cotton-producing state and enslaved persons accounted for 55% of the state population. With large areas of agriculture and rural towns, Mississippi frequently ranks low among states in measures of health, education, and development, and high in measures of poverty. The rest of the state, primarily north of Interstate 20 not including the prairie regions, consists of mixed pine-hardwood forest, common species being loblolly pine, oaks (e.g., water oak), hickories, sweetgum, and elm. The state capital, Jackson, ranks tenth in the nation in concentration of African-American same-sex couples. Mississippi's rank as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton agriculture before and after the Civil War, late development of its frontier bottomlands in the Mississippi Delta, repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century that required massive capital investment in levees, and ditching and draining the bottomlands, and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities. Before the Civil War, Mississippi was the fifth-wealthiest state in the nation, its wealth generated by the labor of slaves in cotton plantations along the rivers.Slaves were counted as property and the rise in the cotton markets since the 1840s had increased their value. Largely due to the domination of the plantation economy, focused on the production of agricultural cotton, the state's elite was reluctant to invest in infrastructure such as roads and railroads.

In 2012, Mississippi had the sixth largest gambling revenue of any state, with $2.25 billion. Momentum Mississippi, a statewide, publicâ€“private partnership dedicated to the development of economic and employment opportunities in Mississippi, was adopted in 2005. It has some major automotive factories, such as the Toyota Mississippi Plant in Blue Springs and a Nissan Automotive plant in Canton. Major cotton farmers in the Delta have large, mechanized plantations, and they receive the majority of extensive federal subsidies going to the state, yet many other residents still live as poor, rural, landless laborers. The state's sizable poultry industry has faced similar challenges in its transition from family-run farms to large mechanized operations. In 2005, Mississippi citizens received approximately $2.02 per dollar of taxes in the way of federal spending.
