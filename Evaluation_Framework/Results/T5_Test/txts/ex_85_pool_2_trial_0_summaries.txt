California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas. In the western part of the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Northern parts of the state have more rain than the south. Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran Desert; upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations. Within the Western hemisphere California is the second most populous sub-national administrative entity (behind the state of SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil) and third most populous sub-national entity of any kind outside Asia (in which wider category it also ranks behind England in the United Kingdom, which has no administrative functions). According to estimates from 2011, California has the largest minority population in the United States by numbers, making up 60% of the state population. California, with 12% of the United States population, has one-third of the nation's welfare recipients.
