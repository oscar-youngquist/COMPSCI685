Private ferry services also link several Rhode Island communities with ports in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. The MBTA Commuter Rail's Providence/Stoughton Line links Providence and T. F. Green Airport with Boston. I-195 provides a limited-access highway connection from Providence (and Connecticut and New York via I-95) to Cape Cod. Several Rhode Island highways extend the state's limited-access highway network. Route 4 is a major north–south freeway linking Providence and Warwick (via I-95) with suburban and beach communities along Narragansett Bay. Route 37 is an important east–west freeway through Cranston and Warwick and links I-95 with I-295.

GT:
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) operates statewide intra- and intercity bus transport from its hubs at Kennedy Plaza in Providence, Pawtucket, and Newport. From 2000 through 2008, RIPTA offered seasonal ferry service linking Providence and Newport (already connected by highway) funded by grant money from the United States Department of Transportation. The MBTA Commuter Rail's Providence/Stoughton Line links Providence and T. F. Green Airport with Boston. Rhode Island's primary airport for passenger and cargo transport is T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, though most Rhode Islanders who wish to travel internationally on direct flights and those who seek a greater availability of flights and destinations often fly through Logan International Airport in Boston. Interstate 95 (I-95) runs southwest to northeast across the state, linking Rhode Island with other states along the East Coast. Several bridges cross Narragansett Bay connecting Aquidneck Island and Conanicut Island to the mainland, most notably the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge and the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge. The East Bay Bike Path stretches from Providence to Bristol along the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay, while the Blackstone River Bikeway will eventually link Providence and Worcester.
