Intent:
How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state has no general sales tax and no personal state income tax (the state does tax, at a five percent rate, income from dividends and interest), and the legislature has exercised fiscal restraint. New Hampshire's two US senators are Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan (both Democrats), both of whom are former governors. New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senatorte president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world, and 24 senators. Most towns generally operate on the town meeting form of government, where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature, and a board of selectmen acts as the executive of the town. Larger towns and the state's thirteen cities operate either on a council–manager or council–mayor form of government. All state-level statutes treat all municipalities identically. In 2006, Democrats won both congressional seats (electing Carol Shea-Porter in the first district and Paul Hodes in the second), re-elected Governor John Lynch, and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses for the first time since 1911. Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874. The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senatorte, a first for any legislative body in the United States. In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made historic gains in New Hampshire, capturing veto-proof majorities in the state legislature, taking all five seats in the Executive Council, electing a new US senator, Kelly Ayotte, winning both US House seats, and reducing the margin of victory of incumbent Governor John Lynch compared to his 2006 and 2008 landslide wins. Republicans control the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature, a governing trifecta in which the Republicans have full governing power. In the 116th United States Congress, it is one of only eight states with an entirely Democratic delegation, five of which are in New England (the others are Delaware, Hawaii, and New Mexico).
\Predicted Summary:
New Hampshire is a state in the Northeastern United States . New Hampshire is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east . New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by area and the 10th least populous US state .

GT:
The New Hampshire State Constitution of 1783 is the supreme law of the state, followed by the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules. These are roughly analogous to the federal United States Constitution, United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations respectively. New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senatorte president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world, and 24 senators. Legislators are paid a nominal salary of $200 per year, the lowest in the US by far, thus most are effectively volunteers, nearly half of which are retirees. The state's sole appellate court is the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in civil or criminal cases. The other state courts are the Probate Court, District Court, and the Family Division. New Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns.
