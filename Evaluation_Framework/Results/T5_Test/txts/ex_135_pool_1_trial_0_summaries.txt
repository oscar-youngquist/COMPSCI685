The main reasons why you would like living in this state

Input:
Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 19th-least populous, but the 9th-least densely populated of the US states. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area, including three of the state's four largest incorporated cities. About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the US federal government, both civilian and military. The largest mountain range in the southern portion of the state is the Spring Mountain Range, just west of Las Vegas. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Nevada is the most mountainous state in the contiguous United States. Lyon County is the third most populous county. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation. In Douglas, Mineral, and Pershing counties, a plurality of residents are of Mexican ancestry. They comprise 56.5% of the Asian American population in Nevada and constitute about 4.3% of the entire state's population. People in these rural counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. Carson City, the state's capital, is a Republican-leaning swing city/county. The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno. The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations.
