Today, NJ Transit has eleven commuter rail lines that run through different parts of the state. NJ Transit also operates three light rail systems in the state. The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail connects Bayonne to North Bergen, through Hoboken and Jersey City. The Newark Light Rail is partially underground, and connects downtown Newark with other parts of the city and its suburbs, Belleville and Bloomfield. The River Line connects Trenton and Camden. The PATH is a rapid transit system consisting of four lines operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
