How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Until 2010, the governor was the only statewide elected executive official in the state and appointed numerous government officials. Formerly, an acting governor was even more powerful as he simultaneously served as president of the New Jersey State Senatorte, thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process. A 2005 amendment to the state Constitution prevents the Senatorte President from becoming acting governor in the event of a permanent gubernatorial vacancy without giving up her or his seat in the state Senatorte. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms. New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. In the other five counties (Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer), there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role. Currently, New Jersey Democrats have majority control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature (Senatorte, 26–14, and Assembly, 54–26), a 10–2 split of the state's twelve seats in the US House of Representatives, and both US Senatorte seats. The governor's appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party; for instance, the attorney general is a Democrat. The state's Democratic strongholds include Camden County, Essex County (typically the state's most Democratic county—it includes Newark, the state's largest city), Hudson County (the second-strongest Democratic county, including Jersey City, the state's second-largest city); Mercer County (especially around Trenton and Princeton), Middlesex County, and Union County (including Elizabeth, the state's fourth-largest city).

The position of Governor of New Jersey has been considered one of the most powerful in the nation. Until 2010, the governor was the only statewide elected executive official in the state and appointed numerous government officials. Phil Murphy (D) is the governor. Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a lieutenant governor. Republican Kim Guadagno was elected the first lieutenant governor of New Jersey and took office on January 19, 2010. The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 1947. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature, consisting of an upper house Senatorte of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years. The New Jersey Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and six associate justices. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county. The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division, which functions as the state's intermediate appellate court. There is also a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. The Faulkner Act, originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: Mayor-Council, Council-Manager, Small Municipality, and Mayor-Council-Administrator.
