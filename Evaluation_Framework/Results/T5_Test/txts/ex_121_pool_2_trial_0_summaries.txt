Utah is the only state where every county contains some national forest. Utah government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The governor is elected for a four-year term. The Utah State Legislature consists of a Senatorte and a House of Representatives. State senators serve four-year terms and representatives two-year terms. It consists of five justices, who are appointed by the governor, and then subject to retention election.
