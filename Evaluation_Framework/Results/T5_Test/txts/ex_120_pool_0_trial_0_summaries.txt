How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
This reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century, although unlike in the Deep South, Tennessee Republicans always expected at least a third of the vote in statewide elections via East Tennessee and Highland Rim Unionists. When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the Southwest Territory, it adopted "Tennessee" as the name of the state. The state constitution allows no more than two justices of the five-member Tennessee Supreme Court to be from one Grand Division and a similar rule applies to certain commissions and boards. Similar to the United States Federal Government, Tennessee's government has three parts. The governor is the only official who is elected statewide. Unlike most states, the state does not elect the lieutenant governor directly; the Tennessee Senatorte elects its Speaker, who serves as lieutenant governor. The bicameral Legislative Branch, known as the Tennessee General Assembly, consists of the 33-member Senatorte and the 99-member House of Representatives. The speaker of the state Senatorte also holds the title of lieutenant governor. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of commission government for cities based on at-large voting for a few positions on a Board of Commission; several cities adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation. It also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties. Tennessee's Constitution requires that each County have an elected Sheriff.
