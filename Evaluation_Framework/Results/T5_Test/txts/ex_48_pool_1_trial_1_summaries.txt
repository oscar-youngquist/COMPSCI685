How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Until 2010, the governor was the only statewide elected executive official in the state and appointed numerous government officials. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Depending on the county, the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government. In the other five counties (Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer), there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role. Currently, New Jersey Democrats have majority control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature (Senatorte, 26–14, and Assembly, 54–26), a 10–2 split of the state's twelve seats in the US House of Representatives, and both US Senatorte seats. The governor's appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party; for instance, the attorney general is a Democrat.

GT:
The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 1947. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature, consisting of an upper house Senatorte of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms. New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year. The New Jersey Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and six associate justices. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70. Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Court, where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard. More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term, after which he or she can be reappointed to serve until age 70.
