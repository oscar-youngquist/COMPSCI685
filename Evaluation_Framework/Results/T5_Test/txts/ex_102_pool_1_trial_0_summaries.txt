Input:
About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the US federal government, both civilian and military. The largest mountain range in the southern portion of the state is the Spring Mountain Range, just west of Las Vegas. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation. In Douglas, Mineral, and Pershing counties, a plurality of residents are of Mexican ancestry. The culture of these places differs significantly from major metropolitan areas. People in these rural counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. The statewide tax rate is 6.85%, with five counties (Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, and Mineral) charging this amount. In Washoe County, which includes Reno, the sales tax rate is 7.725%, due to county option rates for flood control, the ReTRAC train trench project, and mass transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno. The Nevada state parks comprise protected areas managed by the state of Nevada, including state parks, state historic sites, and state recreation areas. The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations.
