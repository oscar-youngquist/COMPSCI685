How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state constitution allows no more than two justices of the five-member Tennessee Supreme Court to be from one Grand Division and a similar rule applies to certain commissions and boards. The governor is the only official who is elected statewide. Unlike most states, the state does not elect the lieutenant governor directly; the Tennessee Senatorte elects its Speaker, who serves as lieutenant governor. The bicameral Legislative Branch, known as the Tennessee General Assembly, consists of the 33-member Senatorte and the 99-member House of Representatives. The speaker of the state Senatorte also holds the title of lieutenant governor. Constitutional officials in the legislative branch are elected by a joint session of the legislature. In the early 21st century, Republican voters control most of the state, especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis. It also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties. Tennessee's Constitution requires that each County have an elected Sheriff.
