Of the fifty states, it is the 34th-largest by area, and with a population of nearly 11.7 million, is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated. The state is known for its status as both a swing state and a bellwether in national elections. Ohio's neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Lake Erie to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast. The climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb) throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's Bluegrass region section, which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and Upland South region of the United States. The industry of Ohio made the state one of the most important states in the Union during the Civil war. This ranks Ohio's economy as the seventh-largest of all fifty states and the District of Columbia. Ohio's manufacturing sector is the third-largest of all fifty United States states in terms of gross domestic product. Additionally, the North Country Trail (the longest of the eleven National Scenic Trails authorized by Congress) and the American Discovery Trail (a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast route across the mid-tier of the United States) pass through Ohio.
