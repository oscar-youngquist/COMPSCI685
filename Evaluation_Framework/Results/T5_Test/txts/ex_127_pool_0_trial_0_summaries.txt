Consequently, the state is a unique melting pot of Southeast Asian, East Asian and North American cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture. Hawaii is the southernmost US state and the second westernmost after Alaska. It is the only US state that is not geographically located in North America, the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago, and the only state in which coffee is commercially cultivable. The state has a lower population density than Ohio and Illinois. About 82.2% of the state's residents were born in the United States. Hawaii is a majority-minority state. Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the gross state product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey. Hawaii has the fewest local governments among US states. Unique to this state is the lack of municipal governments.
