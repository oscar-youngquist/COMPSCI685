It is the second largest US state by both area (after Alaska) and population (after California). Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest, and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Other major cities include Austin, the second-most populous state capital in the US, and El Paso. The Great Plains region in central Texas spans through the state's panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state's hill country near Austin. "Far West Texas" or the "Trans-Pecos" region is the state's Basin and Range Province. Other major rivers include the Pecos, the Brazos, Colorado, and Red River. The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather. The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters. El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual rainfall, while parts of southeast Texas average as much as 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year. The state has three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas. The state's Democratic voters are made up primarily by liberal and minority groups in Austin, Beaumont, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio as well as minority voters in East and South Texas.
