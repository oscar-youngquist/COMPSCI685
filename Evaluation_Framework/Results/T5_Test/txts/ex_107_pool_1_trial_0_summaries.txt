It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north. The state's capital, most populous city, and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines. Iowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The state has a great number of Reformed denominations. Iowa imposes taxes on net state income of individuals, estates, and trusts. The tax rate differs in each locality and is a composite of county, city or rural township, school district and special levies. I-80 travels from the Nebraska state line to the Illinois state line through the center of the state, including Council Bluffs, Des Moines, Iowa City, and the Quad Cities.

In Iowa, the term "political party" refers to political organizations which have received two percent or more of the votes cast for president or governor in the "last preceding general election". As a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the Iowa General Assembly: the House had a Republican majority, while the Senatorte had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senatorte.

The Iowa Board of Regents is composed of nine citizen volunteers appointed by the governor to provide policymaking, coordination, and oversight of the state's three public universities, two special K–12 schools, and affiliated centers.
