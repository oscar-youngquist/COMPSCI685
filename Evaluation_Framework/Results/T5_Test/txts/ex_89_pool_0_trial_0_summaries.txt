It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Arizona shares the Four Corners region with Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico; its other neighboring states are Nevada and California to the west and the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest. Northern Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado Plateau; mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large, deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. In addition to the internationally known Grand Canyon National Park, which is one of the world's seven natural wonders, there are several national forests, national parks, and national monuments. About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. Hohokam, Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloan cultures were among those that flourished throughout the state. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the Colorado Plateau (see Arizona Mountains forests). Like other states of the Southwest United States, Arizona has an abundance of mountains and plateaus. Despite the state's aridity, 27% of Arizona is forest, a percentage comparable to modern-day Romania or Greece. Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. Indicative of the variation in climate, Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over 100 °F (38 °C) (Phoenix), and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with the most days with a low temperature below freezing (Flagstaff). Arizona's Apache County has the highest concentration of speakers of Native American Indian languages in the United States. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors. Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there. In contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, and most of southern Arizona have historically voted more Democratic.
