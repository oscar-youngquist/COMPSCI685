How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The legislature had electoral malapportionment, based on the counting of slaves toward regional populations, and the western white residents were underrepresented in the state legislature. As a result, every county west of the Alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution, which nevertheless passed because of eastern support. The governor, lieutenant governor, the judiciary, sheriffs, and other county officers were to be elected by public vote. Thus, there were two state governments in Virginia: one pledging allegiance to the United States and one to the Confederacy. Most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the Northern panhandle. West Virginia counties administer and collect property taxes, although property tax rates reflect levies for state government, county governments, county boards of education and municipalities. Property taxes are paid to the sheriff of each of the state's 55 counties. The West Virginia legislature sets the rate of tax of county boards of education. The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities: state, county, schools and municipal. The West Virginia Legislature is bicameral. It consists of the House of Delegates and the Senatorte, both housed in the West Virginia State Capitol. The title of Lieutenant Governor is assigned by statute to the senate president. The governor, elected every four years on the same day as the US presidential election, is sworn in during the following January. The title of Lieutenant Governor is assigned by statute to the senate president. For the purpose of courts of general jurisdiction, the state is divided into 31 judicial circuits. The state constitution allows for the creation of an intermediate court of appeals, but the Legislature has never created one. The Supreme Court is made up of five justices, elected in non-partisan elections to 12-year terms. After the 2014 midterm elections Democrats controlled the governorship, the majority of statewide offices, and one US Senatorte seat, while Republicans held one US Senatorte seat, all three of the state's US House seats, and a majority in both houses of the West Virginia Legislature.

The West Virginia Legislature is bicameral. It consists of the House of Delegates and the Senatorte, both housed in the West Virginia State Capitol. It is a citizen's legislature, meaning that legislative office is not a full-time occupation, but rather a part-time position. Consequently, the legislators often hold a full-time job in their community of residence. Typically, the legislature is in session for 60 days between January and early April. The final day of the regular session ends in a bewildering fury of last-minute legislation to meet a constitutionally imposed midnight deadline. During the remainder of the year, monthly interim sessions are held in preparation for the regular session. Legislators also gather periodically for 'special' sessions when called by the governor. The title of Lieutenant Governor is assigned by statute to the senate president. The governor, elected every four years on the same day as the US presidential election, is sworn in during the following January. Governors of West Virginia can serve two consecutive terms but must sit out a term before serving a third term in office. The title of Lieutenant Governor is assigned by statute to the senate president. West Virginia's highest court is the Supreme Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is the busiest appellate court of its type in the United States. West Virginia is one of 11 states with a single appellate court. The state constitution allows for the creation of an intermediate court of appeals, but the Legislature has never created one. The Supreme Court is made up of five justices, elected in non-partisan elections to 12-year terms. At the state level, West Virginia's politics were largely dominated by the Democratic Party from the Great Depression through the 2000s. The West Virginia Department of Commerce is a government agency responsible for overseeing West Virginia's economy, workforce, natural resources, and tourism, the department oversees nine subsidiary agencies.
