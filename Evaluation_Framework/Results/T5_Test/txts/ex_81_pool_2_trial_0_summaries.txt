More than half of Missourians (3,294,936 people, or 55.0%) live within the state's two largest metropolitan areasâ€”St. Missouri produces the most lead of all the states. Missouri is the only state in the Union to have two Federal Reserve Banks: one in Kansas City (serving western Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, northern New Mexico, and Wyoming) and one in St. Louis (serving eastern Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, western Kentucky, western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and all of Arkansas). As a result, and combined with the fact that Missouri is one of America's leading alcohol states, regulation of alcohol and tobacco in Missouri is among the most laissez-faire in America. With a large German immigrant population and the development of a brewing industry, Missouri always has had among the most permissive alcohol laws in the United States.

Education is compulsory from ages seven to seventeen. It is required that any parent, guardian, or another person with custody of a child between the ages of seven and seventeen, the compulsory attendance age for the district, must ensure the child is enrolled in and regularly attends public, private, parochial school, home school or a combination of schools for the full term of the school year. The public school system includes kindergarten to 12th grade. Homeschooling is legal in Missouri and is an option to meet the compulsory education requirement.
