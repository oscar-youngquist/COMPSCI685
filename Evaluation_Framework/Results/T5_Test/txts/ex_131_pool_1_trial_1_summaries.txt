What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. At the same time, some of the communities in Johnson County (metropolitan Kansas City) are among the fastest-growing in the country. The cities of Olathe, Shawnee, De Soto and Gardner have some of the state's fastest growing populations. To the north, Kansas City, with the second largest land area in the state, contains a number of diverse ethnic neighborhoods. The state's agricultural outputs are cattle, sheep, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, hogs, corn, and salt. By far, the most significant agricultural crop in the state is wheat. The industrial outputs are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, apparel, petroleum, and mining. Kansas is ranked eighth in US petroleum production. Kansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. The state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including Spirit AeroSystems, Bombardier Aerospace (LearJet), and Textron Aviation (a merger of the former Cessna, Hawker, and Beechcraft brands).
