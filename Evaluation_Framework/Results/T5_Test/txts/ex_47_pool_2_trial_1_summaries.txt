Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Western Washington also is home of the Olympic Mountains, far west on the Olympic Peninsula, which support dense forests of conifers and areas of temperate rainforest. Common trees and plants in the region are camassia, Douglas fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many species of ferns. The state's various areas of wilderness offer sanctuary, with substantially large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals. Because of the wide range of geography, the State of Washington is home to several different ecoregions, which allow for a varied range of bird species. Among these are the Alta Lake State Park, Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, San Juan Islands National Wildlife Refuge, as well as three national parksâ€”the Olympic National Park, North Cascades National Park, and Mount Rainier National Park. Prominent among their industries were salmon fishing and, notably among the Makah, whale hunting. There are extensive waterways around Washington's largest cities, including Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma and Olympia.
