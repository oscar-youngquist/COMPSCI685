What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
In the early national period, the state became a center of Jeffersonian and Jacksonian democracy, with a strong Whig presence, especially in the western part of the state. The state mainly continued with an economy based on tobacco, cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most populous region, containing the six largest cities in the state by population. The state has a very diverse economy because of its great availability of hydroelectric power, its pleasant climate, and its wide variety of soils. The state ranks third among the South Atlantic states in population, but leads the region in industry and agriculture. North Carolina leads the nation in the production of tobacco, textiles, and furniture. Charlotte, the state's largest city, is a major textile and trade center. North Carolina is the leading US state in production of flue-cured tobacco and sweet potatoes, and comes second in the farming of pigs and hogs, trout, and turkeys. While North Carolina's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth, low unemployment, and rising wages, many of the state's rural counties have suffered from job loss, rising levels of poverty, and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. The nonprofit arts and culture industry generates $1.2 billion in direct economic activity in North Carolina, supporting more than 43,600 full-time equivalent jobs and generating $119 million in revenue for local governments and the state of North Carolina. One of the more famous arts communities in the state is Seagrove, the handmade-pottery capital of the US, where artisans create handcrafted pottery inspired by the same traditions that began in this community more than two hundred years ago. North Carolina has large grazing areas for beef and dairy cattle. The state's shipping, commercial fishing, and lumber industries are important to its economy. Service industries, including education, health care, private research, and retail trade, are also important.

After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont region. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the Research Triangle, a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. The Charlotte metro has experienced large growth mainly due to its finance, banking, and tech industries. North Carolina State, Duke University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have helped the Raleigh region (Research Triangle) attract an educated workforce and develop more jobs. By the 1990s, Charlotte had become a major regional and national banking center.
