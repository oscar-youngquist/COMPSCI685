The capital of California is located within Sacramento.The state is organized into three branches of government—the executive branch consisting of the governor and the other independently elected constitutional officers The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification. After June 8, 2010, when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the United States president and county central committee offices, all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party.

They serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senatorte and 80-member Assembly. Senatortors serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of three terms, and members of the Senatorte are subject to term limits of two terms. California's legal system is explicitly based upon English common law (as is the case with all other states except Louisiana) but carries a few features from Spanish civil law, such as community property. California's prison population grew from 25,000 in 1980 to over 170,000 in 2007. Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest "Death Row" population in the country (though Oklahoma and Texas are far more active in carrying out executions). California is divided into 58 counties. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards. In addition, the county serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors. Incorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities. General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. About 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California's public education.
