How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state takes its name from the nearby Delaware River named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. The state is divided into three counties, having the lowest number of any state; from north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senatorte confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor. The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The governor presents a "State of the State" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware including Senatorte and House. New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the legislature The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two statewide offices in 2014, State Auditor and State Treasurer.
