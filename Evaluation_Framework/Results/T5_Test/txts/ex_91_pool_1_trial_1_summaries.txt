The main reasons why you would like living in this state

Input:
Industries significant for the state economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism. Idaho's agricultural sector supplies many products, but the state is best known for its potato crop, which comprises around one-third of the nationwide yield. Science and technology have become the largest single economic center (over 25% of the state's total revenue) within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined. This made Idaho the tenth fastest-growing state after District of Columbia (+16.74%), Utah (+14.37%), Texas (+14.14%), Florida (+13.29%), Colorado (+13.25%), North Dakota (+13.01%), Nevada (+12.36%), Arizona (+12.20%) and Washington. Idaho is an important agricultural state, producing nearly one-third of the potatoes grown in the United States. Nez Perce County is considered a premier soft white growing locale. It accounts for over 25% of the state's revenue and over 70% of the state's exports. While Idaho's 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) total energy consumption is low compared with other states and represents just 0.5% of United States consumption, the state also has the nation's 11th smallest population, 1.5 million, so its per capita energy consumption of 352 million BTU (103 MWh) is just above the national average of 333 million BTU (98 MWh).
\Predicted Summary:
is the 14th largest, the 12th least populous and the 7th least densely populated of the 50 US states . Idaho is the 14th largest, the 12th least populous and the 7th least densely populated of the 50 states . Idaho is the most densely populated of the 50 states, and is the 14th largest, the 12th least populous and the 7th most densely populated .

GT:
A number of science and technology firms are either headquartered in Idaho or have factories there, and the state also contains the Idaho National Laboratory, which is the country's largest Department of Energy facility. This influence has a moderating effect in the winter where temperatures are not as low as would otherwise be expected for a northern state with predominantly high elevations. Idaho can be hot, although extended periods over 98 °F (37 °C) are rare, except for the lowest point in elevation, Lewiston, which correspondingly sees little snow. In 2014, Idaho emerged as the second most small business friendly state, ranking behind Utah, based on a study drawing upon data from more than 12,000 small business owners.
