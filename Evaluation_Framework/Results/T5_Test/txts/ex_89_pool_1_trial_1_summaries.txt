How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state takes its name from the nearby Delaware River named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. The state is divided into three counties, having the lowest number of any state; from north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. Delaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile more than the national average, and ranking 45th in population. Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senatorte confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor. The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The governor presents a "State of the State" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware including Senatorte and House. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle County, which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats. New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the legislature The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two statewide offices in 2014, State Auditor and State Treasurer. The state is also served by several weekly, monthly and online publications.

Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches. The Delaware General Assembly consists of a House of Representatives with 41 members and a Senatorte with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts: Minor non-constitutional courts include the Justice of the Peace Courts and Aldermen's Courts. Delaware was the last US state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952. The executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The governor presents a "State of the State" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually. Delaware is subdivided into three counties; from north to south they are New Castle, Kent and Sussex. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions. The Democratic Party holds a plurality of registrations in Delaware. Each of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government. Tax is collected by the Delaware Division of Revenue. Delaware has six different income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.
