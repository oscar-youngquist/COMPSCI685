Input:
It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression. Tucson, with a metro population of just over one million, is the state's second-largest city. With 212,635 residents, this cluster of towns is the state's third largest metropolitan area. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors. Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see Copper mining in Arizona), cotton, cattle, citrus, and climate (tourism). Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there.

Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors. Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see Copper mining in Arizona), cotton, cattle, citrus, and climate (tourism). Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output. The state government is Arizona's largest employer, while Banner Health is the state's largest private employer, with more than 39,000 employees (2016). The fiscal year 2006–07 general fund budget, approved by the Arizona Legislature in June 2006, was slightly less than $10 billion. Besides the money spent on state agencies, it also included more than $500 million in income and property tax cuts, pay raises for government employees, and additional funding for the K–12 education system.
