The state takes its name from the nearby Delaware River named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. The state is divided into three counties, having the lowest number of any state; from north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. Delaware is 96 miles (154 km) long and ranges from 9 miles (14 km) to 35 miles (56 km) across, totaling 1,954 square miles (5,060 km2), making it the second-smallest state in the United States after Rhode Island. Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state. In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States. Delaware's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States. Delaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile more than the national average, and ranking 45th in population. Delaware is one of five states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include DE 1, DE 9, and DE 404. This is the fewest among all states. Delaware's swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's population (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle County's 535,000). New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the legislature Dover is the state capital and the second most populous city (38,079).
