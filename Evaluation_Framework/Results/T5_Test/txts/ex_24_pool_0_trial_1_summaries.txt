What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Maine is the 12th-smallest by area, the 9th-least populous, and the 13th-least densely populated of the 50 US states. Maine is the northernmost state in New England and the largest, accounting for almost half of the region's entire land area. The state's population density is 41.3 people per square mile, making it the least densely populated state east of the Mississippi River. Maine's agricultural outputs include poultry, eggs, dairy products, cattle, wild blueberries, apples, maple syrup, and maple sugar. Commercial fishing, once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, particularly lobstering and groundfishing. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy. Maine was a center of agriculture before it achieved statehood. The state is a major producer of potatoes, wild blueberries, apples, maple syrup and sweet corn. Dairy products and chicken's eggs are other major industries.

GT:
Maine's agricultural outputs include poultry, eggs, dairy products, cattle, wild blueberries, apples, maple syrup, and maple sugar. Commercial fishing, once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, particularly lobstering and groundfishing. While lobster is the main seafood focus for Maine, the harvest of both oysters and seaweed are on the rise. In 2015, 14% of the Northeast's total oyster supply came from Maine. In 2017, the production of Maine's seaweed industry was estimated at $20 million per year. Western Maine aquifers and springs are a major source of bottled water. Maine's industrial outputs consist chiefly of paper, lumber and wood products, electronic equipment, leather products, food products, textiles, and bio-technology. Tourism and outdoor recreation play a major and increasingly important role in Maine's economy.
