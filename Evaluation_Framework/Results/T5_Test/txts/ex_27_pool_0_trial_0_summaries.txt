West Virginia is the 41st-largest state by area and ranks 38th in population, with around 1.791 million residents. The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant logging and coal mining industries, and its political and labor history. Most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the Northern panhandle. The native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak, chestnut, maple, beech, and white pine, with willow and American sycamore along the state's waterways. West Virginia is also one of the cloudiest states in the nation, with the cities of Elkins and Beckley ranking 9th and 10th in the US respectively for the number of cloudy days per year (over 210). Only 1.6% of the state's residents were foreign-born, placing West Virginia last among the 50 states in that statistic. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 2014 West Virginia's economy grew twice as fast as the next fastest growing state east of the Mississippi River, ranking third alongside Wyoming and just behind North Dakota and Texas among the fastest growing states in the United States. Tourism contributed $4.27 billion to the state's economy and employed 44,400 people in 2010, making it one of the state's largest industries. In addition to such outdoor recreation opportunities, the state offers a number of historic and cultural attractions. According to the Energy Information Administration, West Virginia is a top coal-producer in the United States, second only to Wyoming. As of 2017, the coal industry accounted for 2% of state employment. West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the Nation in net interstate electricity exports. The state's consumer sales tax is levied at 6% on most products except for non-prepared foods. Although the Department of Tax and Revenue plays a major role in the administration of this tax, less than half of one percent of the property tax collected goes to state government. The state lost 5,600 jobs in its labor force in four critical economic sectors: construction (1,900), manufacturing (1,100), retail (1,800), and education (800), while gaining just 400 in mining and logging. Four of the five counties with the highest rates of drug-induced deaths are in West Virginia (McDowell, Wyoming, Cabell and Raleigh Counties).
