What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of highways and airports. Today, New Mexico's Interstate Highways approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads. New Mexico has only three Interstate Highways. Interstate 10 travels in the southwest portion of New Mexico starting from the Arizona stateline near Lordsburg to the area in between Las Cruces and Anthony, near El Paso, Texas. New Mexico currently has 15 United States Highways. Rural and intercity public transportation by road is provided by Americanos USA, LLC, Greyhound Lines and several government operators. Larger cities in New Mexico typically have some form of public transportation by road In addition to local railroads and other tourist lines, the state jointly owns and operates a heritage narrow-gauge steam railroad, the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railway, with the state of Colorado. Narrow gauge railroads once connected many communities in the northern part of the state, from Farmington to Santa Fe. No fewer than 100 railroads of various names and lineage have operated in the jurisdiction at some point. New Mexico's rail transportation system reached its height in terms of length following admission as a state It eventually reached El Paso, Texas in 1881 and with the Southern Pacific Railroad created the nation's second transcontinental railroad with a junction at Deming. New Mexico is served by two class I railroads, the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad. Combined, they operate 2,200 route miles of railway in the state. A commuter rail operation, the New Mexico Rail Runner Express, connects the state's capital, its largest city, and other communities. Named trains often reflected the territory they traveled: Super Chief, the streamlined successor to the Chief; Navajo, an early transcontinental tourist train; and Cavern, a through car operation connecting Clovis and Carlsbad (by the early 1950s as train 23–24), were some of the named passenger trains of the ATSF that connoted New Mexico. Passenger train service once connected nine of New Mexico's present ten most populous cities (the exception is Rio Rancho), while today passenger train service connects two: Albuquerque and Santa Fe. There is also local government, consisting of counties, municipalities and special districts.

The builders of the ruins at Chaco Canyon also created a radiating network of roads from the mysterious settlement. The pre-Columbian trade with Mesoamerican cultures included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper. Turquoise, pottery, and salt were some of the goods transported south along the Rio Grande. The north–south trade route later became a path for colonists with horses arriving from New Spain as well as trade and communication. The Santa Fe Trail was the 19th-century territory's vital commercial and military highway link to the Eastern United States. New Mexico's latitude and low passes made it an attractive east–west transportation corridor. As a territory, the Gadsden Purchase increased New Mexico's land area for the purpose of the constructing a southern transcontinental railroad, that of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Early transcontinental auto trails later crossed the state bringing more migrants. Today, New Mexico's Interstate Highways approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads.
