How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate freedmen and generally refused to give the vote. The state also has a use tax, which includes 4% to be distributed by the Department of Revenue to local governments. Most parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. A more limited number of parishes operate under home rule charters, electing various forms of government. All other states (except Washington, California, and Maine) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a plurality voting system or runoff voting, to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Its troopers have statewide jurisdiction with power to enforce all laws of the state, including city and parish ordinances. The elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.

A more limited number of parishes operate under home rule charters, electing various forms of government. The Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term "parish" (from the French: paroisse) in place of "county" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of civil law based on French, German, and Spanish legal codes and ultimately Roman law, as opposed to English common law. Louisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the British Empire. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a covenant marriage.
