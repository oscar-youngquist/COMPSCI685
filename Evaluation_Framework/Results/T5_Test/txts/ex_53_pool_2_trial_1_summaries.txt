They include: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Idaho state controller (Auditor before 1994), Treasurer, Attorney General, and Superintendent of Public Instruction. As such, the governor is not elected in the same election year as the president of the United States. Legislative elections occur every even numbered year. The Idaho Legislature has been continuously controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although Democratic legislators are routinely elected from Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and the northern Panhandle. The state's District Courts serve seven judicial districts. Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties. Idaho Congressional delegations have also been generally Republican since statehood.
