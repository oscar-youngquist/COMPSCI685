How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Alaska is by far the largest US state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states Texas, California, and Montana combined, and the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. Like all other US states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive branch consisting of the governor of Alaska and his or her appointees which head executive departments; a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senatorte; and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts. The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senatorte. The governor of Alaska serves four-year terms. Six Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska. Alaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Alaska is the third state with jungle primaries for all statewide races, the second state with ranked voting, and the only state with both. Alaska is not divided into counties, as most of the other US states, but it is divided into boroughs. Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a consolidated cityâ€“county.
