How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
Pennsylvania has had five constitutions during its statehood: 1776, 1790, 1838, 1874, and 1968. The legislature meets in the State Capitol there. The other elected officials composing the executive branch are the Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, Attorney General Joshua Shapiro, Auditor General Timothy DeFoor, and Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. The elections for Attorney General, Auditor General, and Treasurer are held every four years coinciding with a Presidential election. As of the 2018 elections, the Republicans hold the majority in the State House and Senatorte. Pennsylvania is divided into 60 judicial districts, most of which (except Philadelphia) have magisterial district judges (formerly called district justices and justices of the peace), who preside mainly over preliminary hearings in felony and misdemeanor offenses, all minor (summary) criminal offenses, and small civil claims. The Commonwealth Court is limited to appeals from final orders of certain state agencies and certain designated cases from the Courts of Common Pleas. Counties are further subdivided into municipalities that are either incorporated as cities, boroughs, or townships. First- and second-class cities are governed by a "strong mayor" form of mayor–council government, whereas third-class cities are governed by either a "weak mayor" form of government or a council–manager government. There are 958 boroughs in Pennsylvania, all of which are governed by the "weak mayor" form of mayor-council government. The state holds 20 electoral votes. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a US Senatorte seat as well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion.
