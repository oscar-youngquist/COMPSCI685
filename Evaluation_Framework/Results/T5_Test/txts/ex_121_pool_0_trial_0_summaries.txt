The Governor of Colorado heads the state's executive branch. Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction.

The state legislative body is the Colorado General Assembly, which is made up of two houses - the House of Representatives and the Senatorte. The State of Colorado is divided into 64 counties.

The state of Colorado currently has 271 active incorporated municipalities, including 196 towns, 73 cities, and two consolidated city and county governments.
