How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
The state has land borders with Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The charter apportioned legislative seats equally among the state's towns, over-representing rural areas and under-representing the growing industrial centers. In 1842, the charter government and Dorr's supporters held separate elections, and two rival governments claimed sovereignty over the state. Later that year, the legislature drafted a state constitution, removing property requirements for American-born citizens but keeping them in place for immigrants, and retaining urban under-representation in the legislature. The state's current governor is Gina Raimondo (D), and the lieutenant governor is Daniel McKee (D). Its United States senators are Jack Reed (D) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D). The state legislature is the Rhode Island General Assembly, consisting of the 75-member House of Representatives and the 38-member Senatorte. Both houses of the bicameral body are currently dominated by the Democratic Party; the presence of the Republican Party is minor in the state government, with Republicans holding a handful of seats in both the Senatorte and House of Representatives. Though it has the highest overall Catholic percentage of any state, none of Rhode Island's individual counties ranks among the 10 most Catholic in the United States, as Catholics are very evenly spread throughout the state. Rhode Island is divided into five counties but it has no county governments. The entire state is divided into municipalities, which handle all local government affairs.
