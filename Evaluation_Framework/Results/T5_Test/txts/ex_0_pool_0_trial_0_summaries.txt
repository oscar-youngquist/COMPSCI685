Input:
It is the 6th largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. About one-quarter of the state is made up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. The boom and bust economy of mining also left hundreds of ghost towns across the territory, but copper mining continued to prosper with the territory producing more copper than any other state by 1907, which earned Arizona the nickname "the Copper State" at the time of statehood. Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the Great Depression. Tucson, with a metro population of just over one million, is the state's second-largest city. With 212,635 residents, this cluster of towns is the state's third largest metropolitan area. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to numerous tourist attractions including: Grand Canyon National Park, Sedona, and Oak Creek Canyon. The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors. Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see Copper mining in Arizona), cotton, cattle, citrus, and climate (tourism). Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output. The state government is Arizona's largest employer, while Banner Health is the state's largest private employer, with more than 39,000 employees (2016). Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there.
