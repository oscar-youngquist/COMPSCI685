What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 19th-least populous, but the 9th-least densely populated of the US states. The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer, with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent. The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching. Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment. In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada. Nevada's agricultural outputs are cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions, and potatoes. Over 90% of Nevada's 484,000 acres (196,000 ha) of cropland is used to grow hay, mostly alfalfa, for livestock feed. The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined. The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno. The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations.
