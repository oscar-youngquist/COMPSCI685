The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor). The legislative branch is the Maine Legislature, a bicameral body composed of the Maine House of Representatives, with 151 members, and the Maine Senatorte, with 35 members. The executive branch is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the Governor of Maine (currently Janet Mills). The Governor is elected every four years As with other state legislatures, the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senatorte override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties. The state's two members of the United States House of Representatives are Democrats Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden. An organized municipality has a form of elected local government which administers and provides local services, keeps records, collects licensing fees, and can pass locally binding ordinances, among other responsibilities of self-government. Collectively these 488 organized municipalities cover less than half of the state's territory. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds.
