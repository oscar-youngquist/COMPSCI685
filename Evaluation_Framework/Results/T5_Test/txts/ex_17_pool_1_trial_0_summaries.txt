What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Because of its diverse landscapes and waterways, Oregon's economy is largely powered by various forms of agriculture, fishing, and hydroelectric power. Oregon is also the top timber producer of the contiguous United States, and the timber industry dominated the state's economy in the 20th century. Due to the abundance of timber and waterway access via the Willamette River, Portland became a major force in the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest, and quickly became the state's largest city. Hydroelectric power, food, and lumber provided by Oregon helped fuel the development of the West, although the periodic fluctuations in the US building industry have hurt the state's economy on multiple occasions. Oregon farmers and ranchers also produce cattle, sheep, dairy products, eggs and poultry. Because of the abundance of waterways in the state, it is also a major producer of hydroelectric energy. Tourism is also a strong industry in the state. The state's coastal region produces significant tourism as well.
