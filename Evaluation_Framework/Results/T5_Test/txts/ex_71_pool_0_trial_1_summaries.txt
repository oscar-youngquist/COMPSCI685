The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor). The legislative branch is the Maine Legislature, a bicameral body composed of the Maine House of Representatives, with 151 members, and the Maine Senatorte, with 35 members. The executive branch is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the Governor of Maine (currently Janet Mills). The Governor is elected every four years As with other state legislatures, the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senatorte override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor. The highest court of the state is the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Probate judges serve part-time and are elected by the voters of each county for four-year terms. Maine is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties. Since 1969, two of Maine's four electoral votes have been awarded based on the winner of the statewide election; the other two go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's two congressional districts. Every other state except Nebraska gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. They captured the governor's office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s. The state's two members of the United States House of Representatives are Democrats Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden. An organized municipality has a form of elected local government which administers and provides local services, keeps records, collects licensing fees, and can pass locally binding ordinances, among other responsibilities of self-government. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds.
