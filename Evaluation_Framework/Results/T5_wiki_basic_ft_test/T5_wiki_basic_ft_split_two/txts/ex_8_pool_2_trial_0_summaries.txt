In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II, the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service-based economy. CNBC's list of "Top States for Business for 2014" has recognized Massachusetts as the 25th-best state in the nation for business, and for the second year in a row the state was ranked by Bloomberg as the most innovative state in America.
