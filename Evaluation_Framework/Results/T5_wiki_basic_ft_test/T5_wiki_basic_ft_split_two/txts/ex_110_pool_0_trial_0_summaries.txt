It is the state with the highest percentage of timberland area in the country. Much of the state, in particular the White Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. It contains less than 5% of the state's population, suffers relatively high poverty, and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline. Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state, and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. The state's largest economic sectors in 2018, based on contribution to GDP, are: 15% real estate and rental and leasing; 13% professional business services; 12% manufacturing; 10% government and government services; and 9% health care and social services. New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power, hydroelectricity, and wood fuel. Efforts to diversify the state's general economy have been ongoing. Tourist railroads include the Conway Scenic Railroad, Hobo-Winnipesaukee Railroad, and the Mount Washington Cog Railway.
