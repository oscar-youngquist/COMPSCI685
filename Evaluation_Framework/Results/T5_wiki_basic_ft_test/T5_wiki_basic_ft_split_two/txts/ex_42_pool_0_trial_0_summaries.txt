The administration of property taxes is handled by the local assessor in incorporated cities and towns, while property taxes in the unorganized territories are handled by the State Tax Assessor. The Maine Constitution structures Maine's state government, composed of three co-equal branches—the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor). The legislative branch is the Maine Legislature, a bicameral body composed of the Maine House of Representatives, with 151 members, and the Maine Senatorte, with 35 members. The executive branch is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the Governor of Maine (currently Janet Mills). The Governor is elected every four years As with other state legislatures, the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senatorte override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting state laws. All judges except for probate judges serve full-time, are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature for terms of seven years. Probate judges serve part-time and are elected by the voters of each county for four-year terms. Maine is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties. Every other state except Nebraska gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. They captured the governor's office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds. Throughout Maine, many municipalities, although each separate governmental entities, nevertheless form portions of a much larger population base.
