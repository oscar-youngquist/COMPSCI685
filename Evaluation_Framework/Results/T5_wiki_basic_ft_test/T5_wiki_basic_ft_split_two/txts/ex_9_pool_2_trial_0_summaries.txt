Culturally, the coastal plain is split into the Lowcountry and the Pee Dee region. At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end of the Pre-Columbian era around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba, with the total population being up to 20,000. Up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of Siouan background. It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States. Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the Wars of Religion. Between 1670 and 1715, between 24,000 and 51,000 captive Native Americans were exported from South Carolina â€” more than the number of Africans imported to the colonies of the future United States during the same period. Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to other US colonies. Settlers from all over Europe built rice plantations in the South Carolina Lowcountry, east of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. Meanwhile, Upstate South Carolina, west of the Fall Line, was settled by small farmers and traders, who displaced Native American tribes westward. It allowed religious toleration, encouraging settlement, and trade in deerskin, lumber, and beef thrived. In the Antebellum period (before the Civil War) the state's economy and population grew. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century; and created tourism industries. During the early part of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs, opportunities and relative freedom in US cities outside the former Confederate states. South Carolina has many venues for visual and performing arts. There are also numerous historic sites and museums scattered throughout the state paying homage to many events and periods in the state's history from Native American inhabitation to the present day. Several large venues can house major events, including Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, and North Charleston Coliseum. There are also countless local festivals throughout the state highlighting many cultural traditions, historical events, and folklore.
