What are the available modes of transport in this state?

Input:
Two major interstates pass through South Dakota: Interstate 90, which runs east and west through the southern half of the state; and Interstate 29, running north and south in the eastern portion of the state. Also in the state are the shorter Interstates 190, a spur into central Rapid City, and 229, a loop around southern and eastern Sioux Falls. Several major US highways pass through the state. US routes 12, 14, 16, 18 and 212 travel east and west, while US routes 81, 83, 85 and 281 run north and south. Railroads have played an important role in South Dakota transportation since the mid-19th century. Some 4,420 miles (7,110 km) of railroad track were built in South Dakota during the late 19th century and early 20th century, but only 1,839 miles (2,960 km) are active. BNSF Railway is the largest railroad in South Dakota; the Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad (formerly the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern) is the state's other major carrier. Other state carriers include Dakota Southern Railway, Dakota and Iowa Railroad, Ellis and Eastern Railroad, Sunflour Railroad, Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Sisseton Milbank Railroad. Rail transportation in the state is mostly freight, but there are two passenger heritage railroads: the Black Hills Central and the Prairie Village, Herman, and Milwaukee. However, South Dakota is one of the two contiguous states that lack Amtrak service. (South Dakota is the only contiguous state that never had Amtrakâ€”Wyoming used to be served by the San Francisco Zephyr and the Pioneer.)
\Predicted Summary:
is the largest by area, but the 5th most populous, and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States . South Dakota ( (sud)) is the state's largest by area, but the 5th least populous, and the 5th least populous of the 50 . South Dakota is bordered by the states of North Dakota (to the north), Minnesota (to the east), Nebraska (to the south), Wyoming (to the west) and Montana (to the northwest)
