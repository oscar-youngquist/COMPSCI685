What about this state's arts and culture attracts you the most?

Input:
It is the state with the highest percentage of timberland area in the country. Much of the state, in particular the White Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. The center of population has moved south 12 miles (19 km) since 1950, a reflection of the fact the state's fastest growth has been along its southern border, which is within commuting range of Boston and other Massachusetts cities. The four counties covering these two areas account for 72% of the state population, and one (Hillsborough) has nearly 30% of the state population, as well as the two most populous communities, Manchester and Nashua. New Hampshire has the highest percentage (22.9%) of residents with French/French-Canadian/Acadian ancestry of any US state. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are the two largest parties in the state. Tourist railroads include the Conway Scenic Railroad, Hobo-Winnipesaukee Railroad, and the Mount Washington Cog Railway. The following sports teams are based in New Hampshire: Other motor racing venues include Star Speedway and New England Dragway in Epping, Lee Speedway in Lee, Twin State Speedway in Claremont, Monadnock Speedway in Winchester and Canaan Fair Speedway in Canaan. Annually since 2002, high-school statewide all-stars compete against Vermont in ten sports during "Twin State" playoffs.
