How is the government structured in this state?

Input:
It is known as the "Constitution State", the "Nutmeg State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits". The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's constitutional history. The governor heads the executive branch. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. The legislature is the General Assembly. Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senatortors and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senatorte, except when absent from the chamber, when the President pro tempore presides. In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches. The state is also divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns. Each region has an administrative body made up chief executive officers of the member towns.

The governor heads the executive branch. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms. The legislature is the General Assembly. The General Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of an upper body, the State Senatorte (36 senators); and a lower body, the House of Representatives (151 representatives). Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senatorte, except when absent from the chamber, when the President pro tempore presides. The Speaker of the House presides over the House. Locally elected representatives also develop Local ordinances to govern cities and towns. The highest court of Connecticut's judicial branch is the Connecticut Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. Connecticut shares with the rest of New England a governmental institution called the New England town. The state is also divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns. The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions.
