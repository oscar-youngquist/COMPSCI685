Input:
The Government of Massachusetts is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The governor of Massachusetts heads the executive branch; duties of the governor include signing or vetoing legislation, filling judicial and agency appointments, granting pardons, preparing an annual budget, and commanding the Massachusetts National Guard. Each branch consists of several committees. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (a chief justice and six associates) are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the executive council, as are all other judges in the state. Both houses of the legislature have had Democratic majorities since the 1950s. The voters of these now-defunct counties elect only Sheriffs and Registers of Deeds, who are part of the state government.
