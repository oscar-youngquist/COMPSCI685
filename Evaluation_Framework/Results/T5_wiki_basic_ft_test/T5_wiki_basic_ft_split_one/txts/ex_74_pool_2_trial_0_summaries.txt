Input:
This included the right to representative government. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government. The department also groups the counties into eleven regions for tourism purposes: Aside from the five counties of New York City, each of these counties is subdivided into towns and cities, incorporated under state law. It is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The governor is the state's chief executive and is assisted by the lieutenant governor. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the attorney general and the comptroller. The secretary of state, formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the governor. The New York State Legislature is bicameral and consists of the New York State Senatorte and the New York State Assembly. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the governor's power to veto a bill. The state is divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are municipal corporations with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and New York state public-benefit corporations, frequently known as authorities or development corporations. Each municipal corporation is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution. Legislative efforts to amend the statute have failed, and death sentences are no longer sought at the state level, though certain crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government are subject to the federal death penalty. The state has a strong imbalance of payments with the federal government.
