West Virginia is the 41st-largest state by area and ranks 38th in population, with around 1.791 million residents. The unique position of West Virginia means it is often included in several US geographical regions, including the Mid-Atlantic, the Upland South, and the Southeastern United States. The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant logging and coal mining industries, and its political and labor history. Located in the Appalachian Mountain range, West Virginia covers an area of 24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km2), with 24,077.73 square miles (62,361.0 km2) of land and 152.03 square miles (393.8 km2) of water, making it the 41st-largest state in the United States. West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi ("Mountaineers are always free"). About 75% of the state is within the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions. Most of West Virginia lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion, while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. The native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak, chestnut, maple, beech, and white pine, with willow and American sycamore along the state's waterways. It is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state. The state's Northern Panhandle, and North-Central region feel an affinity for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Finally, the towns and farms along the mid-Ohio River, which forms most of the state's western border, have an appearance and culture somewhat resembling the Midwest. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that in 2014 West Virginia's economy grew twice as fast as the next fastest growing state east of the Mississippi River, ranking third alongside Wyoming and just behind North Dakota and Texas among the fastest growing states in the United States. In addition to such outdoor recreation opportunities, the state offers a number of historic and cultural attractions. One of the major resources in West Virginia's economy is coal. According to the Energy Information Administration, West Virginia is a top coal-producer in the United States, second only to Wyoming. West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the Nation in net interstate electricity exports. Farming is also practiced in West Virginia, but on a limited basis because of the mountainous terrain over much of the state. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. This is expected to also help bring economic growth to the southern half of the state.
