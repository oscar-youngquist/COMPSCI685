Kansas ( (listen)) is a US state in the Midwestern United States. Kansas is named after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks. The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean "people of the (south) wind" although this was probably not the term's original meaning. Before European colonization, Kansas was occupied by the Caddoan Wichita and later the Siouan Kaw people. The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, who explored the area in 1541. Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into Spanish Louisiana. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was acquired by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1827, Fort Leavenworth became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state. Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. In response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first US state to adopt a constitutional amendment prohibiting all alcoholic beverages, which was repealed in 1948. The state is divided into 105 counties with 628 cities, with its largest county by area being Butler County. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to glaciation in the Pleistocene and is covered by glacial drift and loess. According to the Köppen climate classification, Kansas's climate can be characterized in terms of three types: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Kansas was 2,913,314 on July 1, 2019, a 2.11% increase since the 2010 United States Census and an increase of 58,387, or 2.05%, since 2010. The focus on labor-efficient grain-based agriculture—such as a large wheat farm that requires only one or a few people with large machinery to operate, rather than a vegetable farm that requires many people—is causing the de-population of rural areas across Kansas. The ten largest reported ancestry groups, which account for nearly 90% of the population, in the state are: German (33.75%), Irish (14.4%), English (14.1%), American (7.5%), French (4.4%), Scottish (4.2%), Dutch (2.5%), Swedish (2.4%), Italian (1.8%), and Polish (1.5%). The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Kansas's total gross domestic product in 2014 was US$140.964 billion. Since the mid-20th century, Kansas has remained one of the most socially conservative states in the nation.
