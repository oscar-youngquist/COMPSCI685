The state takes its name from the nearby Delaware River named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, and has since been known as The First State. The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael, near the site of Lewes in 1631. In 1638 New Sweden, a Swedish trading post and colony, was established at Fort Christina (now in Wilmington) by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive. So it was that New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and Kent County native John Dickinson became the "Penman of the Revolution." Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, Patriot leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence. Initially led by John Haslet, Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the Continental Army, known as the "Delaware Blues" and nicknamed the "Blue Hen's Chicks". The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the Battle of Cooch's Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777, at Cooch's Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a minor Loyalist rebellion in 1778. Following the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor. Delaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861, and so remained in the Union. Church, the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington. On July 1, 2013, same-sex marriage was legalized, and all civil unions would be converted into marriages. More than half of all US publicly traded companies, and 63% of the Fortune 500, are incorporated in Delaware.
