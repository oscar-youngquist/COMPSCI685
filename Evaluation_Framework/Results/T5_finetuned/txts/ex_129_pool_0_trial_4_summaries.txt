Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. Before European colonization, Kansas was occupied by the Caddoan Wichita and later the Siouan Kaw people. The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, who explored the area in 1541. Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. Many African Americans also looked to Kansas as the land of "John Brown" and, led by freedmen like Benjamin "Pap" Singleton, began establishing black colonies in the state. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Kansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. The focus on labor-efficient grain-based agriculture—such as a large wheat farm that requires only one or a few people with large machinery to operate, rather than a vegetable farm that requires many people—is causing the de-population of rural areas across Kansas.

In Kansas alone, there are more than 6,000 ghost towns and dwindling communities, according to one Kansas historian, Daniel C. Fitzgerald. To the north, Kansas City, with the second largest land area in the state, contains a number of diverse ethnic neighborhoods. Wichita's population growth has grown by double digits and the surrounding suburbs are among the fastest growing cities in the state. Southeast Kansas has a unique history with a number of nationally registered historic places in this coal-mining region. Kansas is ranked eighth in US petroleum production. Kansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. The state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Kansas has a history of many firsts in legislative initiatives—it was the first state to institute a system of workers' compensation (1910) and to regulate the securities industry (1911). The state's most famous appearance in literature was as the home of Dorothy Gale, the main character in the novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900).
