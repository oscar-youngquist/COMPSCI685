At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end of the Pre-Columbian era around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba, with the total population being up to 20,000. The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States. In 1562 French Huguenots established a settlement at what is now the Charlesfort-Santa Elena archaeological site on Parris Island. Sixty years later, in 1629, King of England Charles I established the Province of Carolina, an area covering what is now South and North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee. The Carolina slave trade, which included both trading and direct raids by colonists, was the largest among the British colonies in North America. By the second half of the 1700s, South Carolina was one of the richest of the Thirteen Colonies. In February, 1778, South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, the initial governing document of the United States, and in May 1788, South Carolina ratified the United States Constitution, becoming the eighth state to enter the union. During the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783), about a third of combat action took place in South Carolina, more than in any other state. At the end of the war in early 1865, the troops of General William Tecumseh Sherman marched across the state devastating plantations and most of Columbia. After the war, South Carolina was restored to the United States during Reconstruction. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century; and created tourism industries. South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the Nineteenth Amendment (1920) giving women the right to vote. As the 21st century progresses, South Carolina has attracted new business by having a 5% corporate income tax rate, no state property tax, no local income tax, no inventory tax, no sales tax on manufacturing equipment, industrial power or materials for finished products; no wholesale tax, and no unitary tax on worldwide profits.
