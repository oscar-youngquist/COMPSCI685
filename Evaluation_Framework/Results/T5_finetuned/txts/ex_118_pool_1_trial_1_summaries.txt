GT:
The state boycotted the 1787 convention which drew up the United States Constitution and initially refused to ratify it; it was the last of the original 13 states to do so, on May 29, 1790. Formally named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since its accession to the Union in 1790, voters in the state approved an amendment in November 2020 to the state constitution, renaming itself the State of Rhode Island. "Providence Plantations" was therefore the official name of the colony from 1643 to 1663, when a new charter was issued. On June 19, 2020, State Senatortor Harold Metts introduced a resolution for another ballot referendum on removing the words "and Providence Plantations" from the state's name, saying, "Whatever the meaning of the term 'plantations' in the context of Rhode Island's history, it carries a horrific connotation when considering the tragic and racist history of our nation." In 1638 (after conferring with Williams), Anne Hutchinson, William Coddington, John Clarke, Philip Sherman, and other religious dissenters settled on Aquidneck Island (then known as Rhode Island), which was purchased from the local tribes who called it Pocasset. The colony was amalgamated into the Dominion of New England in 1686, as King James II attempted to enforce royal authority over the autonomous colonies in British North America, but the colony regained its independence under the Royal Charter after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Brown University was founded in 1764 as the College in the British Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Rhode Island's tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution. Portsmouth was the site of the first African-American military unit, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, to fight for the US in the unsuccessful Battle of Rhode Island of August 29, 1778. Voting rights were restricted to landowners holding at least $134 in property, disenfranchising well over half of the state's male citizens. In the early 19th century, Rhode Island was subject to a tuberculosis outbreak which led to public hysteria about vampirism. During the American Civil War, Rhode Island was the first Union state to send troops in response to President Lincoln's request for help from the states. Rhode Island furnished 25,236 fighting men, of whom 1,685 died. On the home front, Rhode Island and the other northern states used their industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials that it needed to win the war. The United States Naval Academy moved to Rhode Island temporarily during the war. In 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation in the public schools throughout the state. The 50 years following the Civil War were a time of prosperity and affluence that author William G. McLoughlin calls "Rhode Island's halcyon era." During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 soldiers, of whom 612 died. In 2003, a nightclub fire in West Warwick claimed 100 lives and resulted in nearly twice as many injured, catching national attention. In March 2010, areas of the state received record flooding due to rising rivers from heavy rain.
