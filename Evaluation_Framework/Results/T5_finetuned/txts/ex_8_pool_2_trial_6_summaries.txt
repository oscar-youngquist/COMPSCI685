On July 30, 1609, French explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed this territory as part of New France. The "violent" 1638 New Hampshire earthquake was centered in the St. Lawrence Valley and reported throughout New England. With the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, the North American front of the Seven Years' War between the French and British, the French began construction in 1755 of Fort Carillon at present-day Ticonderoga, New York. Following France's loss in the French and Indian War, through the 1763 Treaty of Paris, it ceded control of land east of the Mississippi River to the British. On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of Vermont. On June 2, 1777, a second convention of 72 delegates met and adopted the name "Vermont." The Battle of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont and the United States. The battles of Bennington and Saratoga together are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army. The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday. The independent state of Vermont issued its own coinage from 1785 to 1788 and operated a national postal service. In January 1791, a convention in Vermont voted 105â€“4 to petition Congress to become a state in the federal union. Congress acted on February 18, 1791, to admit Vermont to the Union as the 14th state as of March 4, 1791. Under the Act "To Secure Freedom to All Persons Within This State," slavery was officially banned by state law on November 25, 1858, less than three years before the American Civil War. In an era influenced by ideas of Social Darwinism, some Vermont leaders promoted eugenics, an idea that the population could be managed and improved by limiting marriage and reproduction by certain members classified as unfit or defective. Large-scale flooding occurred in early November 1927. The 1938 New England hurricane in the fall of that year blew down 15,000,000 acres (61,000 km2) of trees, one-third of the total forest at the time in New England. A major flood occurred in 1973, causing the deaths of two people and millions of dollars in property damage. The state suffered severe flooding in late August 2011 caused by Tropical Storm Irene. Vermont approved women's suffrage decades before it became part of the national constitution.
