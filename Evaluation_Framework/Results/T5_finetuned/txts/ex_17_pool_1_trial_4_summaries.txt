North Dakota is located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States. It lies at the center of the North American continent and borders Canada to the north. Soil is North Dakota's most precious resource. North Dakota has a continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. The temperature differences are significant because of its far inland position and being in the center of the Northern Hemisphere, with roughly equal distances to the North Pole and the Equator. A unique feature of the North Dakota Interstate Highway system is virtually all of it is paved in concrete, not blacktop, because of the extreme weather conditions it must endure.
