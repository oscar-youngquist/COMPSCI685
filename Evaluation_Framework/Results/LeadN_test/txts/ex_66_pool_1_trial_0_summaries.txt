\Predicted Summary:
Minnesota ( (listen)) is a state in the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and northern region of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd US state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes". Its official motto is L'Étoile du Nord, French for "The Star of the North". Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 22nd most populous of the US states. Nearly 55% of its residents live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the "Twin Cities"), the state's main hub of transportation, business, industry, education, arts, and government. Urban centers in "Greater Minnesota" include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester and St. Cloud. The state's geography is defined by western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Before Europeans arrived, Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples going back to the archaic hunter-gatherers of the Woodland period. During the Middle Woodland Period two areas of Hopewell tradition existed in Minnesota. The Laural Complex covered part of the north while the Tremplau Hopewell was in the Mississippi river Valley (100 BCE – 500 CE). After that was the Upper Mississippian culture, which in Minnesota was the Oneota people. It is believed the Siouan languages derive from them. French voyageurs, explorers, and missionaries entered the region in the 17th century, encountering the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe tribes.

The Chippewa and Superior national forests comprise 5.5 million acres (22,000 km2). The Superior National Forest in the northeast contains the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which encompasses over a million acres (4,000 km2) and a thousand lakes. Once primarily a producer of raw materials, Minnesota's economy has transformed to emphasize finished products and services. Perhaps the most significant characteristic of the economy is its diversity Minnesota's per capita personal income in 2019 was $58,834, the thirteenth-highest in the nation. Its 2019 median household income was $74,593, ranking thirteenth in the US and fifth among the 36 states not on the Atlantic coast. As of December 2018 the state's unemployment rate was 2.8 percent. Minnesota's leading fine art museums include the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker Art Center, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum, and The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA). Minnesotans have also made significant contributions to comedy, theater, media, and film. Stereotypical traits of Minnesotans include "Minnesota nice", Lutheranism, a strong sense of community and shared culture, and a distinctive brand of North Central American English sprinkled with Scandinavian expressions.
