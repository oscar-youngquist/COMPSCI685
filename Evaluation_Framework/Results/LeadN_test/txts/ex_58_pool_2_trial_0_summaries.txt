With over 39.3 million residents across a total area of approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous US state and the third-largest by area, as well as the world's thirty-fourth-most-populous subnational entity. California is also the most populated subnational entity in North America, and has its state capital in Sacramento. California's economy, with a gross state product of $3.2 trillion as of 2019, is the largest sub-national economy in the world. Although it accounts for only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any US state. The state's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center. California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. The Agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce. Many coastal cities include some of the wealthiest per-capita areas in the United States. Because it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. However because of its high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities.
