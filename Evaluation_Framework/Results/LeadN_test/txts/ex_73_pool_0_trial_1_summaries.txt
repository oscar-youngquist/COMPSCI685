Alaska is by far the largest US state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states Texas, California, and Montana combined, and the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. It is the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with an estimated population of 738,432 as of 2015—more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area, comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware. While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest, owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance. United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, parks, and wildlife refuges. Alaska's indigenous population is proportionally the highest of any US state, at over 15 percent. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other US states combined. At 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2) in area, Alaska is by far the largest state in the United States, and is more than twice the size of the second-largest US state, Texas. The massive Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here. In 2010, Alaska ranked as the 47th state by population, ahead of North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming (and Washington, D.C.). Alaska is by far the largest US state by area, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income). Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Alaska is the third state with jungle primaries for all statewide races, the second state with ranked voting, and the only state with both. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, Mt.

Alaska ( (listen); Aleut: Alax̂sxax̂; Inupiaq: Alaasikaq; Pacific Gulf Yupik: Alas'kaaq; Tlingit: Anáaski) is a US state on the northwest extremity of the country's West Coast, just across the Bering Strait. A semi-exclave of the US, it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of Yukon to the east and southeast and has a maritime border with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is by far the largest US state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states Texas, California, and Montana combined, and the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. It is the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with an estimated population of 738,432 as of 2015—more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area, comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware. Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge. The Russians were the first Europeans to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the US in 1867 for US$7.2 million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km2). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the US on January 3, 1959. While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest, owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance. United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, parks, and wildlife refuges. Alaska's indigenous population is proportionally the highest of any US state, at over 15 percent. Close to two dozen native languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics. The name "Alaska" (Russian: Аля́ска, tr.

While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest, owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance. Alaska's indigenous population is proportionally the highest of any US state, at over 15 percent. The Interior is the largest region of Alaska Denali National Park and Preserve is located here. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's Mount Fuji. One of the world's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm, just south of Anchorage, where tidal differences can be more than 35 feet (10.7 m). Alaska has more than three million lakes. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.46/km2), with the next state, Wyoming, at 5.8 inhabitants per square mile (2.2/km2). Alaska is by far the largest US state by area, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income). Its per capita personal income for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab. Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries. Many communities have small air taxi services. Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. The richest location in Alaska by per capita income is Halibut Cove ($89,895).
