Although it accounts for only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any US state. California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. However because of its high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States. The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first. As of the 2016 presidential election, California was the second most Democratic state behind Hawaii. Among the political idiosyncrasies and trendsetting, California was the second state to recall their state governor, the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by vote (including Proposition 8 in 2008). The Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature.
