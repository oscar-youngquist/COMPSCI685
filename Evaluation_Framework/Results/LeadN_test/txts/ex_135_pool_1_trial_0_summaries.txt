What drives the economy in this state?

Input:
Logging, farming and railroads were mainstays of Minnesota's early economy. Once primarily a producer of raw materials, Minnesota's economy has transformed to emphasize finished products and services. Although less than one percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the nation's largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans, and has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. In 2016 the state produced 60 percent of the country's usable iron ore.

Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans, and has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2016 the state produced 60 percent of the country's usable iron ore.
