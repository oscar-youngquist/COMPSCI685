With almost ten million residents, Michigan is a large and influential state, ranking tenth in population among the fifty states. Manufacturing in the state grew 6.6% from 2001 to 2006, but the high speculative price of oil became a factor for the US auto industry during the economic crisis of 2008 impacting industry revenues. Its research and development, which includes automotive, comprises a higher percentage of the state's overall gross domestic product than for any other US state. The state is an important source of engineering job opportunities. From 1997 to 2004, Michigan was the only state to top the 10,000 mark for the number of major new developments; however, the effects of the late 2000s recession have slowed the state's economy. The state has maintained its early commitment to public education. Hunting and fishing are significant industries in the state. The state has the highest number of golf courses and registered snowmobiles in the nation.
