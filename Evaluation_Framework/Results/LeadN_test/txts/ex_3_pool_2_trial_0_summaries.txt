Input:
New York has a diverse geography. The central part of the state is dominated by the Finger Lakes, a popular vacation and tourist destination. Many of the Mohicans remained in the region until the 1800s, however, a small group known as the Ouabano migrated southwest into West Virginia at an earlier time. Albany and the Mohawk Valley also have large communities of ethnic Italians and Irish Americans, reflecting 19th and early 20th-century immigration. In Buffalo and western New York, German Americans comprise the largest ancestry. Americans of English ancestry are present throughout all of upstate New York, reflecting early colonial and later immigrants. Native American religions are also a prominent minority. New York is also home to what is widely regarded as the best performing arts schools in the world.
