The Kennedy family was prominent in Massachusetts politics in the 20th century. In 1966, Massachusetts became the first state to directly elect an African American to the US senate with Edward Brooke. Massachusetts is the 7th-smallest state in the United States. Most of Massachusetts has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers. To combat this change, the state of Massachusetts’ Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has outlined a path to decarbonization of the state’s economy. On April 22, 2020, the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs of Massachusetts, Kathleen A. Theoharides, released a Determination of Statewide Emissions limits for 2050. To ensure that the Commonwealth experiences warming no more than 1.5°C of pre-industrialization levels, the state will work to achieve net-zero emissions and the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent by the year 2050.
