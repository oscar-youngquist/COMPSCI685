By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. Out of all the cities in these Midwestern states, 89% have fewer than 3,000 people, and hundreds of those have fewer than 1,000. The cities of Olathe, Shawnee, De Soto and Gardner have some of the state's fastest growing populations. Among cities with at least one thousand residents, Mission Hills has the highest median income in the state. By far, the most significant agricultural crop in the state is wheat. Kansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. The state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%—above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. Kansas also has the country's third largest state highway system after Texas and California.

For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate.
