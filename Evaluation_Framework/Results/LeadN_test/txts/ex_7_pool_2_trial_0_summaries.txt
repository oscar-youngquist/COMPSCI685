\Predicted Summary:
Minnesota ( (listen)) is a state in the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and northern region of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd US state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes". Its official motto is L'Étoile du Nord, French for "The Star of the North". Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 22nd most populous of the US states. Nearly 55% of its residents live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the "Twin Cities"), the state's main hub of transportation, business, industry, education, arts, and government. Urban centers in "Greater Minnesota" include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester and St. Cloud. The state's geography is defined by western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Before Europeans arrived, Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples going back to the archaic hunter-gatherers of the Woodland period. During the Middle Woodland Period two areas of Hopewell tradition existed in Minnesota. The Laural Complex covered part of the north while the Tremplau Hopewell was in the Mississippi river Valley (100 BCE – 500 CE). After that was the Upper Mississippian culture, which in Minnesota was the Oneota people. It is believed the Siouan languages derive from them.

The state's geography is defined by western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota's first state park, Itasca State Park, was established in 1891, and is the source of the Mississippi River. Today Minnesota has 72 state parks and recreation areas, 58 state forests covering about four million acres (16,000 km2), and numerous state wildlife preserves, all managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Saint Paul, in east-central Minnesota along the banks of the Mississippi River, has been Minnesota's capital city since 1849, first as capital of the Territory of Minnesota, and then as the state capital since 1858. Minnesota's leading fine art museums include the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker Art Center, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum, and The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA). The Minnesota Orchestra and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra are prominent full-time professional musical ensembles who perform concerts and offer educational programs to the Twin Cities' community. The world-renowned Guthrie Theater moved into a new Minneapolis facility in 2006, boasting three stages and overlooking the Mississippi River. The Minnesota Fringe Festival in Minneapolis is an annual celebration of theatre, dance, improvisation, puppetry, kids' shows, visual art, and musicals with more than 800 performances over 11 days. The Minnesota State Fair, advertised as The Great Minnesota Get-Together, is an icon of state culture.
