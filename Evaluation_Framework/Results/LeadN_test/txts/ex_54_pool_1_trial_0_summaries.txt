\Predicted Summary:
Minnesota ( (listen)) is a state in the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and northern region of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd US state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state is known as the "Land of 10,000 Lakes". Its official motto is L'Étoile du Nord, French for "The Star of the North". Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 22nd most populous of the US states. Nearly 55% of its residents live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the "Twin Cities"), the state's main hub of transportation, business, industry, education, arts, and government. Urban centers in "Greater Minnesota" include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester and St. Cloud. The state's geography is defined by western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Before Europeans arrived, Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples going back to the archaic hunter-gatherers of the Woodland period.
