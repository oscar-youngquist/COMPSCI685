The Exp_Scripts folder contains python scripts for performing experiments using this framework. See the existing script for the baseline Pegasus model to see how they are constructed.

The Logs folder contains the log-files that are produced when running an experiment. Note, this exists so that running an experiment script can be pushed to the background to free up your terminal. 

(Note, the current Pegasus logfile is incomplete. This is because when I copied everything from my SuDocu directory to this one I had to test if everything still worked. So I killed that experiment early)


The Models folder contains A) the Model abstract class that all models you want to perform experiments on MUST sub-class. B) the sub-classed models for actually performing experiments. 

The Results folder contains the actual results generated by the framework code for each experiment. See ExperimentRunner.py and the Pegasus_Model_Exp.py files for how results are added here (with respect to directory structure)

The Results_Evaluation_Notebooks folder contains Jupyter notebooks for performing analysis on the generated/saved results of an experiment. Usually one notebook per experiment.

utils contains utility code/files. 

The ExperimentRunner.py python file contains the actual "control" logic for performing evaluations. It saves off Rouge-Scores for every predicted summary, as well as the same results clustered by summary intent. 
Additionally, ~10% of the predicted summaries are saved off (along with the GT and the rouge scores) as txt files.
