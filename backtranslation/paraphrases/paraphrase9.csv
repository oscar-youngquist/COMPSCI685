122,0,alabama,122,"The continuation of racial discrimination and lynching, the agricultural depression and the failure of cotton crops due to the infestation of ploughs has led tens of thousands of African-Americans from rural areas of Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in the cities of the north and centre-west during the first decades of the twentieth century as part of the Great Southern Migration."
123,0,alabama,123,"In view of this emigration, the rate of population growth in Alabama (see the table ""historical populations"" below) fell by almost half from 1910 to 1920."
124,0,alabama,124,"At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs."
125,0,alabama,125,"Birmingham grew so rapidly that it was called the ""Magic City""."

130,0,alabama,130, Industrial development linked to the demands of the Second World War has brought a level of prosperity to the unseen state since before the civil war.
131,0,alabama,131,Rural workers have flocked to the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living.

135,0,alabama,135," Despite the massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the predominantly rural legislature refused to renew the seats of the House and Senators according to the population, as required by the Constitution of the State in order to follow the results of the decennial censuses."
136,0,alabama,136, They have maintained their former representation in order to maintain political and economic power in agricultural regions.
137,0,alabama,137,"As a result, Jefferson County, home to Birmingham's industrial and economic power, paid more than a third of all tax revenues to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests are regularly underrepresented in the legislature.
139,0,alabama,139," According to a study carried out in 1960, due to rural domination, ""a minority of about 25 per cent of the total population of the State is under the majority control of the Alabama Legislative Assembly""."
140,0,alabama,140,"In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" should be the basis of both chambers of state legislatures and that their districts should be based on population rather than geographical counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the redistribution of Congress based on the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142," This has benefited urban areas that have developed, as well as the population as a whole that has been underrepresented for more than sixty years."
143,0,alabama,143, Further changes have been made to the establishment of a representative State House and Senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144," African-Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end exclusion and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools should be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply."
146,0,alabama,146,"In the 1960s, under the leadership of Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal desegregation requirements."
147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement experienced remarkable events in Alabama, including the boycott of the Montgomery buses (1955-1956), the Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma in Montgomery Marches."
148,0,alabama,148, They contributed to the passage and adoption by the United States Congress of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
149,0,alabama,149," Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow's customs often continued until it was expressly challenged in court."
150,0,alabama,150," According to the New York Times, in 2017, several Afro-Americans from Alabama lived in the cities of Alabama, such as Birmingham and Montgomery."
151,0,alabama,151,"In addition, the black belt area of central Alabama ""is home to largely poor counties that are mostly African-American."
152,0,alabama,152," These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made changes since the end of the twentieth century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus case of redistriction, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the general vote for seats representing 180 Alabama courts, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155," Voting in general diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats."
156,0,alabama,156," Despite African-Americans who are an important minority in the state, they have not been able to elect representatives in most jurisdictions in general."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of the settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, have adopted a cumulative voting system for the election of representatives in multiple-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158, This results in a more proportional representation of voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 administrations use limited voting, as in Conecuh County."
160,0,alabama,160,"In 1982, the restricted vote was tested for the first time in Conecuh County."
161,0,alabama,161," Together, the use of these systems has increased the number of African American women and women elected to local offices, leading to more representative governments of their citizens."
162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth state of the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of the total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making the Alabama 23rd in quantity of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the United States."

347,0,alabama,347,"The basic document of the Alabama government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901."
348,0,alabama,348," With almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is, according to some, the longest constitution in the world and 40 times longer than the American Constitution."
349,0,alabama,349, There was an important movement to rewrite and modernize the Alabama constitution.
350,0,alabama,350," Critics argue that the Alabama constitution maintains a highly centralized power with the state's legislative power, leaving virtually no power in local hands."
351,0,alabama,351, Most counties do not have a membership rule.
352,0,alabama,352," Any proposed policy changes in the various areas of the State must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, often, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353," According to a critique of the current Constitution, its complexity and length intentionally codifies segregation and racism."
354,0,alabama,354,The Alabama government is divided into three co-equal branches.
355,0,alabama,355,"The legislative power is the Legislative Assembly of Alabama, a bicameral assembly composed of the House of Representatives of Alabama, with 105 members, and the Senator of Alabama, with 35 members."
356,0,alabama,356,"The legislative power is responsible for writing, debating, adopting or rejecting the laws of the State."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party is currently the majority in both chambers of the Legislative Assembly.
358,0,alabama,358,The Legislature has the power to derogate from a right of veto by a simple majority (most state legislatures need a two-thirds majority in order to derogate from a right of veto).
359,0,alabama,359," Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographical basis, per county, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360," Since its constitution was adopted in 1901, it has not redistributed Congressional constituencies, making urbanized areas highly underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,Nor had it changed the legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses.
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one voice"", ruling that Congressional districts should be recomposed on the basis of censuses (as the state had already included in its constitution but had not implemented it)."
363,0,alabama,363,"In addition, the Court held that the two chambers of the legislatures of bicameral States should be distributed by population, as there was no constitutional basis for States to have geographical systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other States had to change their legislative districts, as many countries had systems that were underrepresented in urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365, This had led to decades of under-investment in these areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For example, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes provided one third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of the state's funding."
367,0,alabama,367," Through legislative delegations, the Alabama Legislative Assembly has maintained control of county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive branch is responsible for the enforcement and supervision of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is headed by the Governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370," Other members of the executive branch include the Cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, the Attorney-General of Alabama, the Secretary of State of Alabama, the Treasurer of Alabama State and the Auditor of Alabama State."

375,0,alabama,375,The highest court in the state is the Supreme Court of Alabama.
376,0,alabama,376,Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.

378,0,alabama,378,The current Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All judges who sit on the Supreme Court of Alabama are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380," There are two intermediate courts of appeal, the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal, and four courts of first instance: the circuit court (court of first instance of general jurisdiction) and the district, provincial and municipal courts."
381,0,alabama,381, Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an extremely high implementation rate.
382,0,alabama,382,Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In a few years, it imposes more death sentences than Texas, a state that has a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384," However, executions per capita are considerably higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385, Some of his affairs have been the subject of considerable controversy.
386,0,alabama,386,It was the only State to allow judges to stay jury decisions when applying the death penalty or not.
387,0,alabama,387, This judicial authority was dismissed in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,Taxes are collected by the Revenue Department of Alabama.

390,0,alabama,390," Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their income tax from the state of Alabama, even if they take the standard deduction; those who include it can also deduct the FICA (social security and health insurance tax)."
391,0,alabama,391,The general sales tax rate is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392,City and county sales tax rates are also added to the purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a dinner in Mobile would pay 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"In 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 51 per cent of all government and local revenues, compared with an average of about 36 per cent across the country."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of the seven states that levy a food tax at the same rate as other goods, and one of the two states (the other being the neighbouring Mississippi) that fully taxes the grocery store without any compensatory relief for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most states exempt the grocery store from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on working poor families is one of the highest in the United States, Alabama, the only state to levy income tax on a family of four whose income does not exceed $4,600, or just a quarter of the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,The Alabama threshold is lowest among the 41 states and the Columbia district with income tax.
399,0,alabama,399,The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400," Overall, the federal, state and local tax burden in Alabama makes the State the second least taxed state in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Property taxes are lowest in the United States
402,0,alabama,402,The current Constitution of the State requires an electoral referendum to increase property taxes.
403,0,alabama,403,"As Alabama's tax structure is largely dependent on consumer spending, it is subject to a high variable budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003 Alabama recorded an annual budget deficit of $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405,The Alabama has 67 counties.
406,0,alabama,406," Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually known as a county commission."
407,0,alabama,407,It also has a limited executive power in the county.
408,0,alabama,408," Due to the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power within the state's legislative power, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby and Tuscaloosa) in the state have a limited family regime."
409,0,alabama,409," Instead, most state counties must put pressure on the Local Legislation Committee of the State Legislative Assembly to obtain approval for simple local policies, ranging from waste disposal to land-use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The State Legislative Assembly retained power over local governments by refusing to adopt a constitutional amendment establishing the system of county origin, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission."
411,0,alabama,411, Legislative delegations retain certain powers in each county.
412,0,alabama,412,"The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr (1964) required both houses to have population-based districts and redistributed after each census, in order to apply the principle of ""one man, one voice""."
413,0,alabama,413," Before that, each county was represented by a state senator, resulting in under-representation in the State Senate for the more urbanized and populated counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had failed to redistribute seats in the state house, affected politics well before the 20th century, not recognizing the growth of industrial cities and urbanized areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The absence of a domestic regime for Alabama counties has led to the proliferation of local legislation allowing counties to do things not authorized by the constitution of the state."
416,0,alabama,416,"The constitution of Alabama has been amended more than 700 times, and nearly a third of the amendments are local in nature and apply only to one county or city."

422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white democrats, known as Redemptors, took control of the republican state government, partly by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423," After 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to separate and deprive African American residents, a process completed in the provisions of the 1901 Constitution."
424,0,alabama,424,The provisions depriving blacks of their right to vote have led to the exclusion of many poor whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"In 1941, more whites than blacks were deprived of their voting rights: 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total impact has been greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens have been deprived of their rights and relegated to separate and unequal treatment according to the law."
427,0,alabama,427," From 1901 to 1960, the state did not redraw electoral districts as the population increased and moved within the state during the urbanization and industrialization of certain regions."
428,0,alabama,428,"As the counties were at the base of the electoral districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated State policy for almost three quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases had to be redistributed in 1972 to ensure equal representation."
429,0,alabama,429,"The policy of the state of Alabama received national and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, while the whites, bureaucraticly and sometimes violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."

431,0,alabama,431,"It was only after the passage of the 1964 Federal Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act that African Americans regained the capacity to vote, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many jurisdictions, they continue to be excluded from representation by electoral systems in general, allowing the majority of the population to dominate the elections."
433,0,alabama,433, Some changes have taken place at the county level as a result of court challenges to the creation of single-member districts that allow for a more diverse representation among county councils.

699,1,alaska,699," Alaska is by far the largest American state by region, and the tenth richest (per capita income)."
700,1,alaska,700,"In November 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%.In 2018, it was one of the 14 US states that still had only one regional indicator."
701,1,alaska,701," According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Alaska had 710,231 inhabitants."
702,1,alaska,702,"In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.1%) non-Hispanic whites, 14.8% Alaska Native Americans, 5.4% Asians, 3.3% Blacks or African Americans, 1.0% Hawaii Native Americans and other Pacific Islanders, 1.6% other races and 7.3% two or more races."
703,1,alaska,703," Hispanics or Latinos, regardless of their race, make up 5.5% of the population."
704,1,alaska,704,"In 2011, 50.7% of the Alaskan population under one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two non-Hispanic white parents)."
705,1,alaska,705," According to the 2011 American Community Survey, 83.4% of people over five years of age spoke English only at home."
706,1,alaska,706," About 3.5% spoke Spanish at home, 2.2% another Indo-European language, approximately 4.3% an Asian language (including Tagalog), and about 5.3% another language at home."
707,1,alaska,707,The Alaska Native Language Centre at the University of Alaska Fairbanks states that there are at least 20 Aboriginal languages in Alaska and that there are also some languages with different dialects.
708,1,alaska,708," Most of Alaska's Aboriginal languages belong to Eskimo-Aleut or Na-Dene-speaking families; however, some languages are considered isolates (e.g.:"
709,1,alaska,709,Haida) or have not yet been classified (for example:
710,1,alaska,710,- Tsimshianic).
711,1,alaska,711,"In 2014, almost all of Alaska's native languages were considered threatened, moving, dying, almost extinct or dormant."
712,1,alaska,712,"In total, 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state, known locally as ""Aboriginal languages""."
713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the 20 native languages of the state to official status."
714,1,alaska,714," This bill has given them symbolic recognition as official languages, although they have not been adopted for official use within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages that have been included in the bill are as follows:
716,1,alaska,716," According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2010, approximately 34% of Alaskans were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people were identified as evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholics, and 32,550 as principal Protestants."
718,1,alaska,718," About 4% are Mormons, 0.5% Jews, 1% Muslims, 0.5% Buddhists, 0.2% Baha'is and 0.5% Hindus."
719,1,alaska,719,"The largest religious denominations in Alaska in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents, non-denominational evangelical Protestants with 38,070 adherents, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Saints of last days with 32,170 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents."
720,1,alaska,720," Alaska has been identified, along with the Pacific Northwest States Washington and Oregon, as the least religious states in the United States, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,In 1795 the first Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak.
722,1,alaska,722, Marriage with Alaskan natives helped Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches were gradually created in Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724, Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (percentage) of all states.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for which compliance with the halakha could pose particular problems)."
726,1,alaska,726," Hindus in Alaska often share places and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, the Hindus of Alaska established the Sri Ganesha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu temple in Alaska and the northernmost Hindu temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728,"The number of Hindus in Alaska is estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000."
729,1,alaska,729,The vast majority of Hindus live in Anchorage and Fairbanks.
730,1,alaska,730," Estimates of the number of Muslims in Alaska vary from 2,000 to 5,000."
731,1,alaska,731,"In the late 1990s, the Anchorage Islamic Community Centre began to build a mosque in Anchorage."
732,1,alaska,732, They opened the ground on a building in southern Anchorage in 2010 and were about to be completed at the end of 2014.
733,1,alaska,733," Once finished, the mosque will be the first of the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world."
734,1,alaska,734, There is also a Bahá ́í center.
735,1,alaska,735,"The 2018 gross national product was $55 billion, the nation's 48th largest."
736,1,alaska,736,"Her per capita personal income for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the country."
737,1,alaska,737," According to a 2013 study conducted by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75%."
738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with over 80% of the government's revenues from oil extraction."
739,1,alaska,739," Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture accounts for a tiny portion of Alaska's economy.
741,1,alaska,741," Agricultural production is mainly intended for consumption within the state and includes nurseries, dairy products, vegetables and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742," Manufacturing is limited, with most food and general products imported elsewhere."
743,1,alaska,743," Employment primarily affects government and industries such as natural resource extraction, marine transportation and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744," Military bases are an important component of the economy of the districts of Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island and Kodiak."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746," Its industrial production is crude oil, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other extractive industries, seafood processing, wood and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747, There is also a growing service and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748, Tourists contributed to the economy by supporting local housing.
749,1,alaska,749," Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted."
750,1,alaska,750," Significant oil and gas reserves were found in Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, in February 2014, Alaska fell to fourth place in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota and California."
751,1,alaska,751," Prudhoe Bay, on the northern slope of Alaska, is still the second-high-yielding oil field in the United States, usually producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although at the beginning of 2014, the Bakken North Dakota Formation produced more than 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752," Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil deposit ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than the huge Athabasca oil sands deposit in Canada, which in 2014 produced approximately 1,500 000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of productive reserves at that rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"Trans-Alaska Pipeline can carry and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"In addition, significant coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite coal basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of technically recoverable gas not discovered from natural gas hydrates on the northern slope of Alaska."
756,1,alaska,756, Alaska also offers some of the country's highest hydroelectric potential from its many streams.
757,1,alaska,757,Large sections of the Alaskan coast also have potential for wind and geothermal energy.
758,1,alaska,758," Alaska's economy relies heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electrical energy and light."
759,1,alaska,759," Although wind and hydro power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g., wind and hydro power) have been developed."
760,1,alaska,760,"It was found not to be cost-effective (at the time of reporting, 2001) due to low fuel prices (less than 50¢/gal), long distances and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of one gallon of gas in urban Alaska is generally thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally much higher, but vary greatly depending on transportation costs, seasonal peaks of use, nearby oil development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized oil revenue allocation established by voters in 1976 to manage the government's surplus oil revenues, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans-alaska pipeline system."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the sale of the Prudhoe Bay lease in 1969, for fear that the legislature would spend all the proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at a time."
764,1,alaska,764,He was later defended by Governor Jay Hammond and State representative Kenai Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765," This is an attractive political perspective since then, which diverts revenues that would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaskan Constitution was drafted to discourage the allocation of public funds for a particular purpose.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this situation, mainly because of the political climate of distrust that prevails at the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768," Starting with its initial capital of $734,000, the fund increased to $50 billion due to oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769, Most if not all of the capital is invested cautiously outside Alaska.
770,1,alaska,770," This has led Alaskan politicians to frequently call on the Fund to make investments in Alaska, although such a position has never gained momentum."
771,1,alaska,771," Beginning in 1982, dividends from the annual growth of the fund were paid each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial amount of $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years of payment, since the allocation of payments was retained in a distribution plan proceeding) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time amount of $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772," Each year, the state legislature withdraws 8% of the earnings, gives 3% to the capital for proof of inflation, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all eligible Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To be eligible for the Permanent Fund dividend, one must have lived in the State for at least 12 months, keep his permanent residence subject to authorized absences and not be subject to judicial judgements or criminal convictions that fall under various exclusion classifications or may subject the amount of the payment to civil arrest."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often seen as one of the main examples of a ""basic income"" policy in the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska was long higher than in the 48 contiguous states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal government employees, particularly U.S. Postal Service (USPS) employees and active members, receive a subsistence allowance normally set at 25% of basic pay because, although the cost of living has decreased, it is still one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska is experiencing extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to relatively limited transport infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778," Because of the northern climate and the short growing season, breeding is relatively low in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779," Most farms are located either in the Matanuska Valley, about 64 kilometres north-east of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 97 kilometres south-west of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits crops that can be grown, but long sunny summer days make productive growing seasons."
781,1,alaska,781,"The main crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce and cabbages."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural site, particularly the Delta Junction area, about 160 km southeast of Fairbanks, with a large concentration of farms growing agronomic crops, which are mainly to the north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783, This region was largely set aside and developed as part of a state programme led by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784,The delta crops consist mainly of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"To the west of Fairbanks is another concentration of small farms serving restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and community-supported agriculture."
786,1,alaska,786,"In recent years, Alaskan agriculture has seen strong growth in market gardeners, small farms and agricultural markets, with the largest percentage increase (46%) in the country's agricultural market growth in 2011, compared to 17% nationally."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a supply gap elsewhere in the world, filling a niche in the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788," Alaska, which does not have a county, lacks county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789," However, a small assortment of state fairs and local fairs (with Alaska's largest state fair in Palmer) take place mainly in late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"Fairs are primarily located in communities with historical or current farming activities, and feature local farmers exhibiting products in addition to more publicized commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792," Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the main fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific."
793,1,alaska,793,Seafood is one of the few food products that are often cheaper within the state than outside.
794,1,alaska,794," Many Alaskans take advantage of the salmon season to harvest portions of their domestic diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as for sport."
795,1,alaska,795," This includes fish caught by hook, net, or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Subsistence hunting, mainly caribou, moose and Dall's sheep, is still common in the state, particularly in the remote communities of Bush."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of traditional indigenous diet is Akutaq, Eskimo Ice Cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798," Alaska reindeer farming is concentrated on the Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with domestic reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799," Most food in Alaska is transported to the state from the outside, and shipping costs make food relatively expensive in cities."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, hunting and subsistence gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitive."
801,1,alaska,801," Although most of the small towns and villages in Alaska are located along the coast, the cost of importing food into remote villages can be high, due to terrain and difficult road conditions, which change significantly due to climate change and precipitation."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transportation can reach up to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult periods, if these places can be reached at all during these adverse climatic conditions and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering an American gallon (3.8 litres) of milk is approximately $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"The cost of fuel per gallon is regularly twenty to thirty cents higher than the United States contiguous average, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805, Alaska has few road links compared to the rest of the United States.
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road network covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centres and the Alaska Highway, the main exit route from the state across Canada."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a motor ferry; this has led to a debate for decades about moving the capital to a city on the road network, or the construction of a road link from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,"In western Alaska, there is no road system linking communities to the rest of Alaska."
809,1,alaska,809, Alaska's interstate highways comprise a total of 1082 miles.
810,1,alaska,810,"One of the unique features of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an Alaskan railway tunnel in operation recently renovated to provide asphalt road connections to the isolated community of Whittier, Prince William Sound, to Seward Road, approximately 80 kilometres southeast of Anchorage, Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 4.0 km, the tunnel was North America's longest road tunnel until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812,The tunnel is North America's longest road and rail tunnel.
813,1,alaska,813," Built around 1915, the Alaskan Railway (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska during the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It connects the navigation of the North Pacific by providing critical infrastructure with routes from Seward to the interior of Alaska through south-central Alaska, through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and the North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815," Cities, villages and areas served by the ARR are known throughout the State as the ""railway belt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the continuous improvement of the asphalt road network has begun to overshadow the importance of the railway to the Alaskan economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railway played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight to Alaska while transporting natural resources to the south, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy at Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,He is well known for his summer tourist service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaska Railway was one of the last railways in North America to use cabotage in regular service and still use it on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last flag stop roads in the country.
821,1,alaska,821,A section of about 100 km of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road.
822,1,alaska,822," Until the park road was built in the 1970s, the railway provided the only land access to most of the area along its entire road."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northeastern Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Highway also partly crosses the state from Skagway northward to Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at the White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824," This line is now mainly used by tourists, who often arrive by cruise ship in Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was presented in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways.
826,1,alaska,826,The Alaskan railway network is not externally connected.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The closest link to the North American rail system is the northwestern terminus of Canada's National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada and the 48 minus."
829,1,alaska,829, Some private companies offer float service between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830," Many towns and villages in the state do not have access to the road or highway; the only modes of access include air, river or sea travel."
831,1,alaska,831,"The well-developed Alaskan state ferry network (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of the southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832, Ferries carry vehicles as well as passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The network also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington, and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada, through the inland passage to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important maritime link for many communities in the Southeast Prince of Wales area and works in collaboration with Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summer tourism market, mainly linking the Pacific Northwest to southeastern Alaska and, to a lesser extent, the cities along the Gulf of Alaska coast."
836,1,alaska,836,"The population of Ketchikan, for example, fluctuates dramatically over many days – up to four large cruise ships can moor there at the same time."
837,1,alaska,837," Cities not served by road, sea or river can only be served by air, foot, dog sled or snow machine, which represents Alaska's highly developed bush air services, a novelty of Alaska."
838,1,alaska,838,"L'Anchorage and, to a lesser extent, Fairbanks, are served by many large airlines."
839,1,alaska,839," Due to limited road access, air transport remains the most efficient form of transport within and outside the state."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed extensive renovation and construction work at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to respond to the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska welcomed nearly two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841," Regular flights to most commercially viable villages and towns in the state are difficult to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government as part of the essential air services program."
842,1,alaska,842," Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering jet flights in the state (sometimes in combination cargo and passengers Boeing 737-400) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional centres such as Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak and other major communities, as well as major communities in the southeast and the Alaska Peninsula."
843,1,alaska,843,"The majority of the remaining commercial flights come from small regional suburban companies such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"Smaller towns and villages have to rely on regular or chartered bush flight services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845," Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska mail bypass program, which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to rural Alaskan communities."
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires that 70% of this subsidy be provided to carriers that provide passenger services to communities.
847,1,alaska,847, Many communities have smaller air taxi services.
848,1,alaska,848, These transactions stemmed from the demand for personalized transportation to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849, Perhaps the most quintessence aircraft in Alaska is the bush seaplane.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights to remote villages without airstrips carry passengers, freight, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,"In 2006, Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita in any U.S. state."
852,1,alaska,852, Another method of transport in Alaska is the dog sled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (i.e. at any time after the mid-1920s), dog mushing is more a sport than a means of transportation."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are organized around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod sled dog race, a trail of 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum race in Nome in which moshers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicines very necessary to the diphtheria community of Nome when all the other means of transport failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from around the world come to Anchorage every March to fight for money, prizes and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that follows more precisely the route of the famous 1925 relay, starting from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) in Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by off-road vehicle and winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine,"" as is commonly known in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859, Alaska's Internet and other data transportation systems are largely provided by the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and, at the end of 2011, Alaska Communications announced that it has ""two fibre optic pathways down 48 and two more throughout Alaska."
861,1,alaska,861,"In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to link Asia and the rural areas of Alaska was planned, partially supported by $350 million in stimulus to the federal government."
862,1,alaska,862," Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive power composed of the Governor of Alaska and his appointed persons who are head of executive departments; a legislative power composed of the House of Representatives of Alaska and Senators of Alaska; and a judicial power composed of the Supreme Court of Alaska and the lower courts."
863,1,alaska,863,"The state of Alaska employs about 16,000 people throughout the state."
864,1,alaska,864,The Alaska Legislative Assembly consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senator.
865,1,alaska,865," Senators serve four-year terms, and members of the House two."
866,1,alaska,866,The Governor of Alaska is appointed for a term of four years.
867,1,alaska,867,"The Lieutenant Governor presents himself separately from the Governor in the primaries, but in the general election the candidate for governorship and the candidate for lieutenant governor stand together on the same note."
868,1,alaska,868,"The Alaskan judicial system has four levels: the Alaskan Supreme Court, the Alaskan Court of Appeal, the Superior Courts, and the District Courts."
869,1,alaska,869,The Superior and District Courts are courts of first instance.
870,1,alaska,870," Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts deal with only certain types of cases, including criminal cases and civil cases of up to $100,000."
871,1,alaska,871,The Supreme Court and Court of Appeal are courts of appeal.
872,1,alaska,872,"The Court of Appeal is required to hear appeals from certain decisions of the lower courts, including those relating to criminal prosecution, juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus."
873,1,alaska,873,"The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and, at its discretion, hears criminal appeals."

1909,4,california,1909,"The Spaniards gave the name of Las Californias to the Baja California Peninsula and Alta California, the region that has become the present state of California."
1910,4,california,1910,"The name is probably derived from the mythical island of California in the fictitious history of Queen Calafia, as recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandián by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo."
1911,4,california,1911, This work was the fifth in a series of popular Spanish chivalry novels that began with Amadis de Gaula.

1913,4,california,1913,"In the fictional paradise, Queen Calafia's leader fought alongside the Muslims and his name may have been chosen to echo the title of Muslim leader, the Caliph."
1914,4,california,1914,It is possible that the Californian name was intended to imply that the island was a caliphate.
1915,4,california,1915,"The abbreviated forms of the state name include CA, Cal, Cali, Calif, Calfas, and US-CA."
1916,4,california,1916," Installed by successive waves of arrivals over the last 13,000 years at least, California is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse regions in pre-Columbian North America."

1920,4,california,1920,"Trade, marriage between spouses and military alliances have fostered many social and economic relations between different groups."
1921,4,california,1921,The first Europeans to explore the Californian coast were members of a Spanish sailing expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo; they entered San Diego Bay on 28 September 1542 and reached at least as far north as the island of San Miguel.

1931,4,california,1931," Spanish colonization began to decimate indigenous people through epidemics of various diseases for which indigenous peoples had no natural immunity, such as measles and diphtheria."
1932,4,california,1932,"The establishment of the Spanish systems of government and social structure, which the Spanish settlers had brought with them, also submerged the societies of the first indigenous peoples technologically and culturally."
1933,4,california,1933," During the same period, Russian ships also explored the coast of California and established a trading post at Fort Ross in 1812."
1934,4,california,1934,"The Russian coastal colonies of the early 19th century in California were located just north of the northernmost limit of the Spanish colony area in San Francisco Bay, and were the southernmost Russian colonies in North America."

1938,4,california,1938,The governor has granted many square leagues of land to others who have political influence.
1939,4,california,1939, These huge ranches or cattle ranches have become the dominant institutions of Mexican California.

1943,4,california,1943," These newcomers used the Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts of California and its surroundings."
1944,4,california,1944,"The first newly independent Mexican government was very unstable, and in a reflection of this, starting in 1831, California also experienced a series of armed conflicts, both internal and with the Mexican central government."
1945,4,california,1945," During this turbulent political period, Juan Bautista Alvarado was able to serve as governor from 1836 to 1842."

1948,4,california,1948,John Marsh is one of California's largest breeders.
1949,4,california,1949," After not obtaining justice from the Mexican courts against squatters in his territory, he determined that California should be part of the United States."
1950,4,california,1950," Marsh led a campaign of writing letters marrying the Californian climate, the soil, and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best way to follow, which became known as the ""Marsh Road""."
1951,4,california,1951," His letters were read, read, passed, and printed in newspapers across the country, and began the first trains of cars going to California."
1952,4,california,1952,He invited the immigrants to stay in his ranch until they could settle and helped get their passport.
1953,4,california,1953," After opening the organized emigration to California, Marsh engaged in a military battle between the Mexican General, Manuel Micheltorena, and the Californian governor whom he had replaced, Juan Bautista Alvarado."
1954,4,california,1954,The armies of each meet at the Battle of Providencia near Los Angeles.

1960,4,california,1960, This paved the way for the final acquisition of California by the US.
1961,4,california,1961,"In 1846, a group of American settlers, inside and around Sonoma, rebelled against Mexican domination during the bear flag revolt."
1962,4,california,1962," Subsequently, the rebels raised the Bear flag (holding a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words ""Republic of California"") in Sonoma."
1963,4,california,1963,"The only president of the Republic was William B. Ide, who played a central role during the revolt of the Bear flag."
1964,4,california,1964, This American settler revolt served as a prelude to the US military invasion of California later and was closely coordinated with neighbouring US military commanders.

1969,4,california,1969,The lower even slightly more populated and arid region of the former Baja California remained a part of Mexico.
1970,4,california,1970,"In 1846, it was estimated that the total population of settlers in the western part of the former Alta California was not more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, compared to about 300,000 before Hispanic colonization in 1769."
1971,4,california,1971,"In 1848, only a week before the American official annexation of the region, gold was discovered in California, which was an event that had to forever change both the demography of the state and its finances."

2414,4,california,2414," Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including the current Governor Gavin Newsom; however, the state has elected Republican governors, although many of its Republican governors, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more centrist than the national party."
2415,4,california,2415, Several political movements have advocated California's independence.
2416,4,california,2416,The California National Party and the California Freedom Coalition advocate for Californian independence in the sense of progressivism and civic nationalism.
2417,4,california,2417,"The Yes California movement attempted to hold a referendum on independence through an electoral initiative for 2019, which was then postponed."

2522,5,colorado,2522,Colorado's climate is more complex than states outside the mountain state region.
2523,5,colorado,2523," Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than the north."
2524,5,colorado,2524," Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,The mountains and surrounding valleys have a great influence on the local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a general rule, the increase in altitude leads to a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeastern, eastern and southeastern Colorado are mostly the high plains, while northern Colorado is a mixture of high plains, foothills and mountains."
2528,5,colorado,2528,"The northwest and west of Colorado are mainly mountainous, with mixed desert lands."
2529,5,colorado,2529,Southwestern and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountainous regions.
2530,5,colorado,2530,"The climate of the eastern plains is semi-arid (Köppen climate classification: BSk) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually 15-25 inches (380-640 millimetres) per year."
2531,5,colorado,2531,"The area is known for its abundant sun and cool and bright nights, which give this area a large range of average daytime temperature."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable, because the heat dissipates in the space during the clear nights, since the thermal radiation is not trapped by the clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, home to most of Colorado's population, is in a severe precipitation shadow because it is on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this area can have many days above 95°F (35°C) and often 100°F (38°C)."
2535,5,colorado,2535,"In the plains, winter lows typically range from 25 to 10°F (−4 to -23°C)."
2536,5,colorado,2536," Approximately 75% of precipitation occurs during the growing season, from April to September, but this area is highly drought-prone."
2537,5,colorado,2537," Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and major snowstorms that occur in winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538," If not, winters tend to be generally dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,"In much of the area, Mars is the most snowy month."
2540,5,colorado,2540,"The months of April and May are normally the wettest, while April is the wettest in total."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"The cities of Front Range closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in winter due to the Chinook wind that warms the region, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70°F (21°C) or higher in winter."
2542,5,colorado,2542,The mean July temperature is 55°F (13°C) in the morning and 90°F (32°C) in the afternoon.
2543,5,colorado,2543,"The mean temperature in January is 18°F (−8°C) in the morning and 48°F (9°C) in the afternoon, although the variation between consecutive days may be 40°F (20°C)."
2544,5,colorado,2544,"To the west of the plains and in the foothills, there are a wide variety of climatic types."
2545,5,colorado,2545, Locations a few kilometres apart may experience totally different climatic conditions depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546," Most valleys have a semi-arid climate that is no different from the eastern plains, which moves to an alpine climate at the highest altitudes."
2547,5,colorado,2547,"Microclimates also exist in local areas that cover almost the full spectrum of climates, including subtropical highlands (Cfb/Cwb), wet subtropicals (Cfa), wet continentals (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterraneans (Csa/Csb) and subarctics (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548," Extreme climate change is common in Colorado, although much of the extreme climate change occurs in the less populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549," Storms are common east of the continental ditch in spring and summer, but are generally short."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"Hail is a common view in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern plains, especially the northeastern part of the State."
2551,5,colorado,2551,Hail is the most commonly reported serious weather hazard for the warm season and occasionally causes human injuries as well as significant material damage.
2552,5,colorado,2552,The eastern plains are prone to some of the largest hailstorms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553,"An example is the violent hailstorms that struck Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the most costly ever recorded in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The eastern plains are part of the extreme west of the Tornado gangway; some of the harmful tornadoes on the eastern plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the 2008 Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern plains see particularly frequent tornadoes, whether from mesocyclones in storms of supercells or less intense tillages, as in the Denver Convergence Zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,The plains are also exposed to occasional flooding and particularly severe flash floods caused by both thunderstorms and rapid snowmelt in the mountains during warm weather.
2557,5,colorado,2557," Significant examples include the Denver flood in 1965, the Big Thompson flood in 1976 and the Colorado flood in 2013."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common in the summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's record in 1901 for consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken in the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record of nearly a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561," Much of Colorado is very dry, with an average of only 17 inches (430 millimetres) of precipitation per year across the state."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely goes through a period when part of it is not to some extent drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563," Lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of forest fires in the state, such as the 2002 Hayman Fire."
2564,5,colorado,2564," Other notable fires include the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, the Waldo Canyon Fire, and the June 2012 High Park Fire, as well as the June 2013 Black Forest Fire."
2565,5,colorado,2565," Even these fires were overtaken by the pine mulch fire, Cameron Peak's fire, and the Eastern Troublefire in 2020, all three of the largest fires in Colorado history (see Colorado Forest Fires in 2020)."
2566,5,colorado,2566," However, some mountainous areas of Colorado receive a large amount of moisture from winter snowfall."
2567,5,colorado,2567,"The spring melting of these snows often causes large flows of water in the Yampa River, Colorado River, Rio Grande, Arkansas, North Platte River and South Platte River."
2568,5,colorado,2568,"Water flowing from the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very important source of water for farms, towns and cities in southwestern New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada, as well as for the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas."
2569,5,colorado,2569,"A significant amount of water is also diverted to be used in California; from time to time (formerly naturally and regularly), water flows reach northern Mexico."
2570,5,colorado,2570,"The highest ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115°F (46.1°C) on July 20, 2019, at the John Martin Dam."
2571,5,colorado,2571,The official minimum air temperature was −61°F (−51.7°C) on 1 February 1985 at Maybell.
2572,5,colorado,2572,"In spite of its mountainous terrain, Colorado is relatively calm on the seismic plane."
2573,5,colorado,2573,The National Earthquake Information Centre of the United States is located in Golden.
2574,5,colorado,2574,"On 22 August 2011, an earthquake of magnitude 5.3 occurred 14 km west-southwest of the city of Trinidad."
2575,5,colorado,2575, There were no casualties and only a small number of damage was reported.
2576,5,colorado,2576,It was the second earthquake in Colorado history.
2577,5,colorado,2577,In 1973 an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 was recorded.
2578,5,colorado,2578,"In the early morning of August 24, 2018, four minor earthquakes caught up with Colorado, ranging from magnitude 2.9 to 4.3."

3341,7,delaware,3341,"In a Maryland-like vein, Delaware's geography, culture and history combine elements from the Middle Atlantic, North-East and South regions of the country."
3342,7,delaware,3342," Before its shores were explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Amerindians, including Lenape to the north and Nanticoke to the south."
3343,7,delaware,3343,"It was first colonized by Dutch merchants at Zwaanendael, near the present town of Lewes, in 1631."

3347,7,delaware,3347,"The state is named after the Delaware River, which in turn derives its name from Thomas West, the 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577–1618), who was the governor in power of the colony of Virginia at the time when Europeans first explored the river."
3348,7,delaware,3348,"The people of Delaware, a name used by Europeans for the native Lenape of the Delaware Valley, also derives its name from the same source."

3350,7,delaware,3350,It's probably from a Norman War Place.

3353,7,delaware,3353,It could also be linked to a patronymic of old Norse verr.
3354,7,delaware,3354,"The Delaware is 154 kilometres long and ranges from 14 kilometres to 56 kilometres long, making it the second smallest state in the United States after Rhode Island."
3355,7,delaware,3355,"Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania, to the east by Delaware River, Delaware Bay, New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean, and to the west and south by Maryland."
3356,7,delaware,3356,Small portions of Delaware are also located on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land borders with New Jersey.
3357,7,delaware,3357,"Delaware, along with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia, form the Delmarva Peninsula, which extends along the central Atlantic coast."
3358,7,delaware,3358,The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual.
3359,7,delaware,3359, Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending 12 miles (19.3 km) from the dome of the New Castle City Courthouse.
3360,7,delaware,3360, This border is often called the circle of the Twelve-Miles.
3361,7,delaware,3361," Although the circle of twelve miles is often considered the only territorial border in the United States that is a true arc, the Mexican border with Texas includes several arches, and many cities in the South (such as the plains, Georgia) also have circular boundaries."
3362,7,delaware,3362," This boundary extends to the east to the low point on the shore of New Jersey, then continues south along the shore until it again reaches the 12 miles (19 km) arc to the south; then the boundary continues more conventionally in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River."
3363,7,delaware,3363,"To the west, part of the bow extends beyond the eastern boundary of Maryland."
3364,7,delaware,3364,The rest of the western border runs a little east of the south from its intersection with the arch.
3365,7,delaware,3365,"Land between the northwest portion of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed."
3366,7,delaware,3366,"Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation."
3367,7,delaware,3367," Its highest altitude, located at Ebright Azimuth, near Concord High School, is less than 450 feet (140 metres) above sea level."
3368,7,delaware,3368,The northernmost part of the State is part of the Piedmont plateau with hills and rolling surfaces.
3369,7,delaware,3369,"The fall line of the Atlantic dashboard follows approximately the Robert Kirkwood road between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road lies the Atlantic coastal plain with flat, sandy terrain and, in some parts, marshy terrain."
3370,7,delaware,3370,A ridge of approximately 75 to 80 feet (23 to 24 m) extends along the western boundary of the state and separates watersheds that feed the Delaware River from the bay to the east and Chesapeake Bay to the west.
3371,7,delaware,3371," Since almost all of Delaware is part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate."
3372,7,delaware,3372,The State is located in the humid subtropical climate zone.
3373,7,delaware,3373," Despite its small size (about 160 km) between the northernmost and southernmost points, the average temperature and amount of snowfall vary considerably between Sussex County and New Castle County."
3374,7,delaware,3374," Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern part of the state has a milder climate and longer growing season than the northern part of the state."

3376,7,delaware,3376,The record historical record of -17°F (−27°C) was also recorded in Millsboro on 17 January 1893.
3377,7,delaware,3377,Hardiness zones are 7a and 7b.
3378,7,delaware,3378,The Delaware transition climate supports a wide variety of vegetation.
3379,7,delaware,3379,In the northern third of the state there are northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States.
3380,7,delaware,3380,"In the south, two-thirds of the state is located in mid-Atlantic coastal forests."
3381,7,delaware,3381,"Trap Pond State Park, as well as other areas of Sussex County, for example, are home to bald cypress stands in northern North America."
3382,7,delaware,3382,"Delaware provides government subsidies for the cleaning of ""lightly contaminated"" property with hazardous waste, the product of which comes from a wholesale oil sales tax."
3383,7,delaware,3383," Before Delaware was colonized by European settlers, the area housed the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mainly along the coast, and the Nanticokes who occupied much of the southern Delmarva peninsula."
3384,7,delaware,3384,"John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of Nanticoke – they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating to Chesapeake Bay."
3385,7,delaware,3385,Kuskarawocks are probably the Tuscarora.
3386,7,delaware,3386,The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely linked to the Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River.
3387,7,delaware,3387," They had an established hunting and farming company, and they quickly became involved in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their former enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock."
3388,7,delaware,3388," With the loss of their land on the Delaware River and the destruction of Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wanted to remain identified as such left the area and moved over the Alleghany Mountains in the mid-18th century."
3389,7,delaware,3389,"In general, those who did not move out of Delaware's state were baptized, became Christians and were regrouped with others of colour in official documents and in the minds of their non-Aboriginal American neighbours."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the current Delaware in the Middle Region by establishing a trading post in Zwaanendael, near the Lewes site in 1631."
3391,7,delaware,3391," Within a year, all settlers were killed in a dispute with the Amerindian tribes in the region."
3392,7,delaware,3392,"In 1638, a new Sweden, a trading post and a Swedish colony was established at Fort Christina (now Wilmington) by Peter Minuit as head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch."
3393,7,delaware,3393,The colony of New Sweden lasted for 17 years.
3394,7,delaware,3394,"In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at the present time New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the colony of New Sweden, annexing it to the Netherlands New Land."
3395,7,delaware,3395," Nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr, under the leadership of James, the Duke of York."
3396,7,delaware,3396," Combating a previous claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, owner of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat doubtful property to William Penn in 1682."
3397,7,delaware,3397,"Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his province of Pennsylvania and praised what was then known as the Duke's ""low counties on Delaware""."
3398,7,delaware,3398,Penn established a representative government and briefly combined its two assets under one General Assembly in 1682.
3399,7,delaware,3399," However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had become so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the consent of the lower counties, and the two groups of representatives began to meet alone, one in Philadelphia, and the other in New Castle."
3400,7,delaware,3400,Penn and his heirs have remained owners of both and have always appointed the same person as governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory in the lower counties.
3401,7,delaware,3401,The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique.
3402,7,delaware,3402, From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.
3403,7,delaware,3403, Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for a period of time.
3404,7,delaware,3404," Depending on the first years of contract work, Delaware imports more slaves while the number of English immigrants declines with better economic conditions in England."

4330,9,georgia,4330, Due to anthropogenic changes The climate in Georgia is warming.

4345,9,georgia,4345," Today, many of these same people claiming to be of ""American"" descent are actually of English origin, and some of them are of Scottish origin; however, their families have been living in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify themselves simply as having an ""American"" ancestry or do not know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346," Their ancestry dates mainly to the thirteen colonies of origin and, for this reason, many of them are now content to claim American ancestry, although they are mainly of English ancestry."

4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonization of a large number of Scottish, English-American and Scottish-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmonts, and coastal colonization by some English-Americans and Afro-Americans have strongly influenced state culture in food, language and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported into coastal areas in the 18th century several times in the rice regions of West Africa led to the development of the Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the lower country among African Americans.

4406,9,georgia,4406," Until 1964, the Georgian state government had the longest record of domination of a single party by the Democratic Party of any state of the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407, This record was largely established due to the abandonment of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws at the beginning of the 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408," Some elements, such as the obligation to pay voting taxes and pass literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted in the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early twentieth century."

4414,9,georgia,4414," Most importantly, any Georgian descendant of a veteran of any of these wars was also exempted."
4415,9,georgia,4415," Because in 1908 many white men in Georgia were grandsons of veterans and/or possessed the property required, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only whites to vote."
4416,9,georgia,4416,"Good character qualifications, knowledge of citizenship and literacy (all subjectively determined by white registrars) and property were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote."
4417,9,georgia,4417,Voter lists have fallen dramatically.
4418,9,georgia,4418,"At the beginning of the 20th century, Progressive promoted electoral reform and reduced the power of ward leaders to cleanse politics."

4691,10,hawaii,4691,The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an underwater magma source called the Hawaii Hotspot.
4692,10,hawaii,4692,"The process continues to build islands; the tectonic plate under most of the Pacific Ocean continuously moves to the northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes."
4693,10,hawaii,4693," Due to the location of the hotspot, all of the currently active terrestrial volcanoes are located on the southern half of Hawaii Island."
4694,10,hawaii,4694,"The most recent volcano, Lōahi Seamount, is located south of the coast of Hawaii Island."

4704,10,hawaii,4704,"The destruction affected at least 36 buildings, which, together with lava flows and sulphur dioxide fumes, necessitated the evacuation of more than 2,000 local residents from the neighbourhoods."
4705,10,hawaii,4705," Since the Hawaiian Islands are far from other terrestrial habitats, it is believed that life has reached them by the wind, by the waves (i.e."
4706,10,hawaii,4706,"by ocean currents) and wings (i.e.,"
4707,10,hawaii,4707," birds, insects and all the seeds they may have borne on their feathers)."
4708,10,hawaii,4708," This isolation, combined with the diversity of the environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates and arid shores), has allowed the evolution of endemic flora and fauna."

4714,10,hawaii,4714,The archipelago's main current islands have been above the surface of the ocean for less than 10 million years.
4715,10,hawaii,4715,The islands are well known for the diversity of the environment that occurs on high mountains within a trade field.
4716,10,hawaii,4716,"On a single island, the climate around the coast can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres of annual precipitation) to wet tropical; on the slopes, the environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres per year), to temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold and dry climate."
4717,10,hawaii,4717,"Rainy climate has implications for soil development, which largely determines soil permeability, affecting the distribution of rivers and wetlands."

4722,10,hawaii,4722,The Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Monument was proclaimed by President George W. Bush on 15 June 2006.
4723,10,hawaii,4723,"The monument covers approximately 140,000 square kilometres (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls and shallow deep waters up to 80 kilometres off the Pacific Ocean, an area larger than all United States national parks combined."
4724,10,hawaii,4724,"The Hawaii climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme due to near-constant trade winds in the east."
4725,10,hawaii,4725,"Summer peaks usually reach about 88°F (31°C) during the day, with temperatures reaching a minimum of 75°F (24°C) at night."

4731,10,hawaii,4731,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state, at Pahala on April 27, 1931, is 100°F (38°C), making it bound to Alaska as the lowest observed temperature in the U.S. state."
4732,10,hawaii,4732," Its record low temperature is 12°F (−11°C) observed in May 1979, at the top of Mauna Kea."
4733,10,hawaii,4733, Hawaii is the only state that has ever recorded any Fahrenheit subzero temperatures.
4734,10,hawaii,4734,"The climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into wind and wind zones (ko-olau and kona, respectively) depending on their location relative to the upper mountains."
4735,10,hawaii,4735,The windy sides face with cloudy cover.
4736,10,hawaii,4736, Hawaii is one of the two states that were widely recognized independent nations before joining the United States.
4737,10,hawaii,4737,The Kingdom of Hawaii was sovereign from 1810 to 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by capitalists and resident American and European landowners.
4738,10,hawaii,4738," Hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until 12 August 1898, when it officially became a territory of the United States."
4739,10,hawaii,4739, Hawaii was admitted as an American state on 21 August 1959.
4740,10,hawaii,4740,"On the basis of archaeological data, the first habitation in the Hawaiian Islands dates back to about 300 AD, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands."
4741,10,hawaii,4741,A second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora occurred in the 11th century.
4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of the human discovery and housing of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743," Some archaeologists and historians believe that it is a wave of immigrants from Tahiti around 1000 AD who introduced a new line of high leaders, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the construction of Heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744, This later immigration is detailed in the Hawaiian mythology (mo-olelo) about Pa-ao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745, Other authors say that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a subsequent influx of Tahitian settlers and that Paao should be considered a myth.
4746,10,hawaii,4746,"The history of the islands is marked by a slow and steady growth of the population and the size of the capitals, which have grown to encompass entire islands."
4747,10,hawaii,4747,"The local leaders, called alii, ruled their colonies and waged wars to expand their influence and defend their communities against predatory rivals."
4748,10,hawaii,4748,"The former Hawaii was a caste-based society, as was the Hindu society in India."
4749,10,hawaii,4749,"The arrival in 1778 of the British explorer, Captain James Cook, marked the first documented contact of a European explorer with Hawaii."
4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the archipelago ""Sandwich Islands"" in honour of his sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the location of the islands and making the name native as Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form ""Owyhee"" or ""Owhyhee"" is retained in the name of certain parts of the U.S. Northwest Pacific, including Owyhee County and the Owyhee Mountains in Idaho, named after three Hawaiian Aboriginal members of an extirpated trapping party in the area."
4752,10,hawaii,4752,"It is very possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the sixteenth century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778."
4753,10,hawaii,4753,"Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships leaving Acapulco in 1542 for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano on board as a pilot."
4754,10,hawaii,4754," According to interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe a meeting with the Hawaiians or the Marshall Islands."
4755,10,hawaii,4755," If the crew of Villalobos had spotted Hawaii, Gaetano would be considered the first European to see the islands."
4756,10,hawaii,4756, Some scholars have rejected these claims because of a lack of credibility.
4757,10,hawaii,4757," Nevertheless, the Spanish archives contain a map that represents the islands at the same latitude as Hawaii, but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands."

4761,10,hawaii,4761,The exact route was kept secret in order to protect the Spanish commercial monopoly from competing powers.
4762,10,hawaii,4762," Hawaii thus retained its independence, although it was situated on an east-west sea route between the nations that were subjects of the Vice-royalty of New Spain, an empire that exercised jurisdiction over many civilizations and subject kingdoms on both sides of the Pacific."

5197,11,idaho,5197,"It officially became American territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho territory was only organized in 1863, instead of being included for periods in the Oregon Territory and the Washington Territory."

5209,11,idaho,5209,The origin of the name remains a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the U.S. Congress planned to organize a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician who presented himself as an unrecognized delegate of the unofficial territory of Jefferson."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a Shoshone term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""the name of the mountains,"" but it was later revealed that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he was inspired to give the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"As the name appeared to be made, the U.S. Congress finally decided to appoint the Colorado Territory region instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time this decision was made, the city of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been appointed according to Willing's proposal."

5216,11,idaho,5216,"In any event, part of Washington's territory, including Idaho County, was used to create Idaho's territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217," Finally, the name was given to the Idaho Territory, which later became the US state."
5218,11,idaho,5218," Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well in the 20th century repeated as Willing's narrative the name ""Idaho"" derived from the term Shoshone ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,A 1956 Idaho history manual says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"An alternative to etymology attributes the name to the Plains Apache word ""ídaahęя"" IPA: [í.ta=.h=""] (enemy) which was used in reference to the Comanche."

5276,11,idaho,5276,"The first attempts of organized communities, within the current borders of Idaho, were launched in 1860."
5277,11,idaho,5277,Lewiston was the first permanent community incorporated in 1861.
5278,11,idaho,5278," After a few tribulations as a territory, including the chaotic transfer from the territorial capital of Lewiston to Boise, the abandonment of the right to vote of the Mormonist polygamous confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, and a federal attempt to divide the territory between the territory of Washington which obtained state status in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho obtained state status in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,The Idaho was one of the hardest hit by the Pacific Northwest States during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280," Prices fell for Idaho's main crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes earned only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho's farmers saw their annual income fall from $686 in 1929 to $250 in 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its business base as a state of tourism and agriculture to include science and technology industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest economic centre in the state (more than 25 per cent of total government revenue) and are more important than agriculture, forestry and mining combined."
5283,11,idaho,5283," According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Idaho was 1,787,065 on July 1, 2018, an increase of 14% since 2010."

5289,11,idaho,5289," From 2017 to 2018, Idaho grew up in second place, surpassed only the Nevada."
5290,11,idaho,5290,"Nampa, about 30 km west of downtown Boise, became the second largest city in the state in the late 1990s, passing through Pocatello and Idaho Falls."
5291,11,idaho,5291,"The population of Nampa was less than 29,000 in 1990 and increased to over 81,000 in 2010."
5292,11,idaho,5292," Located between Nampa and Boise, Meridian has also experienced strong growth from less than 10,000 residents in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now the third largest city in Idaho."
5293,11,idaho,5293," Growth of 5% or more was also observed during the same period in Caldwell, Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls and Twin Falls."
5294,11,idaho,5294," From 1990 to 2010, the Idaho population increased by more than 560,000 (55 per cent)."

5308,11,idaho,5308,The County of Nez Perce is considered a prominent soft white growth site.
5309,11,idaho,5309,"Idaho's major industries are food processing, lumber and wood products, machinery, chemicals, paper products, electronic manufacturing, silver and other extractive industries, and tourism."
5310,11,idaho,5310,"The largest factory in the world for cheese in barrels, the raw product for processed cheese is in Gooding, Idaho."

5348,11,idaho,5348,"In 2017, Idaho's primary energy source was hydro, and energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatt hours (MWh)."
5349,11,idaho,5349,"In 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market, with Idaho Public Services Commission regulating the three main utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,The energy landscape of Idaho supports the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,The State is rich in renewable energy resources but has limited fossil fuel resources.
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller watersheds provide Idaho with some of the country's best hydroelectric resources and geologically active mountain areas have considerable geothermal power and wind energy potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353, These realities have shaped much of the state's energy landscape.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports most of the energy that it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355," Imports account for more than 80% of energy consumption, including the full supply of natural gas and oil to Idaho and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"In 2005, 48% of the electricity consumed in Idaho came from hydroelectricity, 42% came from coal combustion and 9% from natural gas."
5357,11,idaho,5357,The rest comes from other renewable sources such as wind energy.
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The state's numerous watersheds allow hydropower plants to supply 556,000 MWh, or about three quarters of the electricity generated by Idaho in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,The state of Washington provides most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two main pipeline systems that supply the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360," Although the government relies on non-state sources for its entire natural gas supply, it uses natural gas-fired facilities to produce 127,000 MWh, or about 10 per cent of its production."
5361,11,idaho,5361, Coal production and the small grid of state wind turbines feed the rest of the state's electricity production.
5362,11,idaho,5362,"The state produces 739 000 MWh, but still has to import half of its electricity from the outside to meet demand."
5363,11,idaho,5363," While the 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) in Idaho are small compared to other states and account for only 0.5% of U.S. consumption, the state also has the country's 11th smallest population, or 1.5 million people, so that its per capita energy consumption of 352 million BTU (103 MWh) is just above the national average of 333 million BTU (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th state in terms of area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), the distance creates an additional problem of ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365," When the length of an electric transmission line is doubled, the resistance to passing electric current is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States and the population is expected to increase by 31 per cent between 2008 and 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367," This projected increase in the population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, which will further increase Idaho's limited hydroelectric resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has a higher estimate of the development potential to produce 44 320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind energy and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar energy using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of photovoltaics on roofs, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar energy."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Ministry of Transportation is the government agency responsible for Idaho's transportation infrastructure, including operation and maintenance and planning for future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The Agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of federal, state and subsidies for government transportation programs."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is one of the few states in the nation without a major highway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise to the south and Coeur d'Alene to the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"The United States-95 connects both ends of the state, but like many other Idaho highways, it is in dire need of repair and improvement."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Department of Transport stated that the Government's road infrastructure is facing an annual deficit of $200 million in maintenance and improvements."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main highway connecting the southeast and southwest parts of the state, with I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Major Federal Aid Roads in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"Major airports include the Boise International Airport serving the southwestern Idaho and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) serving northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377, Other scheduled airports include Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving Palouse; Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and the north and west centre of Idaho; Magic Valley Regional Airport at Twin Falls; Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and Pocatello Regional Airport.
5378,11,idaho,5378,Idaho is served by three transcontinental railways.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland, and Spokane to the west, and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"The BNSF travels to Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary counties."
5381,11,idaho,5381,"The Union Pacific railway crosses North Idaho by entering Canada via Boundary and Bonner, and heading towards Spokane."
5382,11,idaho,5382,Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Northern Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland (Oregon).
5383,11,idaho,5383,"Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop at Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384," Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho"
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific railway also crosses southern Idaho between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming and Ogden, Utah, and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,Lewiston Harbour is the furthest port from the west coast of the Pacific.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and the Columbia River facilitate the movement of the Lewiston barge to Portland, where goods are loaded onto ocean vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,The constitution of Idaho is largely modelled on the national constitution with several additions.
5389,11,idaho,5389,The Constitution defines the form and functions of the State government and may be modified by a plebiscite.
5390,11,idaho,5390,"At present, the constitution of the State requires the government of the State to maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391,"As a result, Idaho has limited debts (construction obligations, etc.)."

5393,11,idaho,5393,All Idaho laws are contained in the Idaho Code and Statute.
5394,11,idaho,5394,The Code is amended by the legislature with the approval of the Governor.
5395,11,idaho,5395,The Idaho still operates under its original constitution (1889) of the state.
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The Idaho Constitution provides for three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected from 35 legislative districts, each represented by a senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398," Since 1946, state-wide elected constitutional officers have been elected for a four-year term."
5399,11,idaho,5399," These include the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of State of Idaho (Pre-1994 Auditor), the Treasurer, the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Education."
5400,11,idaho,5400," Last questioned in 1966, the Inspector of Mines was a constitutional body originally elected."
5401,11,idaho,5401," Subsequently, it was an appointed position and eventually completely abolished in 1974."
5402,11,idaho,5402,The government of Idaho has a monopoly on alcohol.
5403,11,idaho,5403,The Governor of Idaho has a four-year term and is elected in the so-called national mid-term elections.
5404,11,idaho,5404,"As such, the Governor is not elected during the same election year as the President of the United States."
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current governor is Republican Brad Little, who was elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,Idaho's legislative power is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407," However, the session may be extended if necessary, and it is often extended."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"As a result, the legislators of Idaho are considered ""citizen legislators"", which means that their position as legislator is not their main profession."
5409,11,idaho,5409,The terms of office of the senator and the House of Representatives are two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410," Parliamentary elections are held every year, even when numbered."
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The Idaho Legislature has been continuously controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although democratic legislators are systematically elected from Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and in the north of Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,The highest court in Idaho is the Supreme Court of Idaho.
5413,11,idaho,5413," There is also an interim court of appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeal, which hears cases assigned to it by the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The State District Courts are at the service of seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,The Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416," Since 1919 there have been 44 counties in the state, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 km2)."
5417,11,idaho,5417, Three counties were first designated as such by the Land Assembly of Washington in 1861.
5418,11,idaho,5418,"Nez Percé County in 1861 has since been divided into counties of Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai and Clearwater."
5419,11,idaho,5419,The Idaho licence plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county name.
5420,11,idaho,5420," When a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number shall accompany it in alphabetical order."
5421,11,idaho,5421," This reflects an abnormal situation coinciding with ten counties starting with B, seven with C and four with L, or 21 out of 44 counties."
5422,11,idaho,5422," After the civil war, many Democrats from the Midwest and South settled in the territory of Idaho."
5423,11,idaho,5423,"As a result, the first territorial legislatures were heavily controlled by the democrats."
5424,11,idaho,5424,"On the other hand, most territorial governors were appointed by Republican Presidents and were Republicans."
5425,11,idaho,5425," This has led to sometimes bitter clashes between the two parties, including a war of scope with the democrats supporting the shepherds and the Republicans the breeders, which ended in the trial for the murder of Jack Davis ""Diamondfield""."
5426,11,idaho,5426,In the 1880s Republicans became more important in local politics.
5427,11,idaho,5427,In 1864 Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and statehood from a locked safe and took them to Boise.
5428,11,idaho,5428," This did indeed move the capital from where they were stored (Lewiston, Idaho) to the current capital Boise."
5429,11,idaho,5429," Since statehood, the Republican Party is generally the dominant party of Idaho."
5430,11,idaho,5430,"At one time, the Idaho had two democratic parties, one being the general public and the other called the anti-Marmon Democrats, which lasted at the beginning of the 20th century."
5431,11,idaho,5431,"In the 1890s and early 1900s, the populist party enjoyed importance, while the Democratic Party retained a brief domination in the 1930s during the Great Depression."
5432,11,idaho,5432," Since the Second World War, most of the state-wide elected representatives have been Republicans, although Democrats were the majority in the House (by one seat) in 1958 and in the post of Governor from 1971 to 1995."
5433,11,idaho,5433,The delegations of the Idaho Congress have also been generally republican since the status of state.
5434,11,idaho,5434," Several Idaho Democrats have had an electoral success in the House over the years, but the Senators' delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades."
5435,11,idaho,5435," Several Idaho Republicans, including the current Senator Mike Crapo, won the re-election in the Senate, but only Frank Church won the re-election as a Democrat."

6352,13,indiana,6352,The explanation seems to be some factors in the labour market.
6353,13,indiana,6353,"First of all, a large part of heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires a highly skilled workforce, and companies are often willing to find where skills that are difficult to train already exist."
6354,13,indiana,6354,"Second, Indiana's labour force is found primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolitan areas."

6412,13,indiana,6412," Most Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system has replaced the old arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) it is much easier to identify call sources placed in the 9-1-1 system."
6413,13,indiana,6413, These systems are easier to implement in the glacially flat northern and central parts of the state.
6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on non-systematic road names (e.g., Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott and Washington counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415, There are also counties in the northern parts of the state that have never set up a grid or implemented only a part of it.
6416,13,indiana,6416," Some counties are also located in a grid system that is almost similar to that of diamonds (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson and Knox counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417, Such a system is also almost unnecessary in these situations.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"One day Knox County used two different network systems for county roads because the county was constructed using two different survey grids, but it has since decided to use road names and to combine roads instead."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"In particular, the county road network of St. Joseph County, the main city of which is South Bend, uses perennial tree names (i.e., the name of the province)."

6542,14,iowa,6542,"Fort Madison was built to control the trade and establish American domination over the Upper Mississippi, but it was misconceived and hostile by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom were allies with the British, who had not abandoned the claims of the territory."
6543,14,iowa,6543,"Fort Madison was defeated by the British-backed Aboriginal people in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby, on the Dog Prairie in Wisconsin, also fell into British hands."

6549,14,iowa,6549,"A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison, which delivered much of Illinois to the United States, enraged many Sauk and led to the Black Hawk War of 1832."
6550,14,iowa,6550,"The Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley in 1832 in the Black Hawk purchase and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of which settled on a reserve in Kansas."

6553,14,iowa,6553," However, contrary to the unprecedented act of the Iowa Legislature, the United States federal government, by resorting to treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk of Iowa in 1848, and the Dakota of Iowa in 1858."

6561,14,iowa,6561," Once admitted to the Union, the problems of the state border solved, and most of its land purchased from the natives, Iowa gave its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the rich agricultural lands of the young border state, good citizens, free and open society, and good government."
6562,14,iowa,6562,Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs.
6563,14,iowa,6563,The first and second Iowa State Fairs took place in the eastern part of the more developed state in Fairfield.
6564,14,iowa,6564,"The first fair took place from October 25 to 27, 1854, for a cost of approximately 323."
6565,14,iowa,6565," Subsequently, the fair moved to places closer to the centre of the State and found, in 1886, a permanent house in Des Moines."
6566,14,iowa,6566," Since then, the State Fair has been held every year, with a few exceptions: 1898 due to the war between Spain and America and the World Fair held in Omaha, Nebraska, nearby; 1942-19, due to the Second World War, because the fairs were used as a supply depot for the army; and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."
6567,14,iowa,6567,"The Iowa supported the Union during the civil war, voting strongly for Abraham Lincoln, although there was an anti-war movement ""Copperhead"" in the state, caused in part by a fall in crop prices caused by the war."
6568,14,iowa,6568," There was no battle in the state, although the Battle of Athens, the Missouri, 1861, was fought just opposite the River Des Moines of Croton, Iowa, and the shots of the battle landed in Iowa."
6569,14,iowa,6569,Iowa sent a lot of food to the armies and eastern cities.

6579,14,iowa,6579,"Iowa has several Brigadier Generals and four principal Generals, namely Grenville Mellen Dodge, Samuel R. Curtis, Francis J. Herron and Frederick Steele, and many of its generals occupy a prominent position in the state and the country after the war."
6580,14,iowa,6580," After the civil war, the population of Iowa continued to increase dramatically from 674,913 in 1860 to 1,624,615 in 1880."
6581,14,iowa,6581,The American Civil War brought briefly higher profits.
6582,14,iowa,6582,"In 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers and all Iowans experienced an economy in times of war."
6583,14,iowa,6583,"For farmers, change was significant."
6584,14,iowa,6584," Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war."

6586,14,iowa,6586," Starting with the first industries developed in the 1830s, which were mainly intended for the processing of cultivated materials in the region, Iowa experienced a gradual increase in the number of enterprises and manufacturing operations."
6587,14,iowa,6587,The transition from an agricultural to a mixed economy took place slowly.
6588,14,iowa,6588,"The Great Depression and the Second World War accelerated the transition from small farms to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization."

7737,16,kentucky,7737," Nevertheless, in the 19th century, Kentucky received a large number of German immigrants, who settled mainly in the Midwest, along Ohio mainly in Louisville, Covington and Newport."
7738,16,kentucky,7738," Only Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia have higher percentages of German ancestry than Kentucky in the southern states defined by the census, although the percentage of Kentucky is closer to Arkansas and Virginia than that of the previously appointed state."

7744,16,kentucky,7744,Louisville's 1914 Order on Residential Racial Segregation was rescinded by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1917.
7745,16,kentucky,7745," However, in 1908, Kentucky enacted the law of the day, ""An Act to Prohibit White and Colourful Persons from Attending the Same School"", which Berea College unsuccessfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in 1908; in 1948, Lyman T. Johnson brought an action for admission to the University of Kentucky; therefore, in the summer of 1949, nearly thirty African-American students entered the United Kingdom's graduate and professional curricula."

7905,17,louisiana,7905,"The colony soon became a flourishing river port and a crossroads, giving birth to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were exploited by imported African slaves."
7906,17,louisiana,7906,"Over time, the planters have developed large plantations and built beautiful houses in a growing city."
7907,17,louisiana,7907," This has become a repeated model in New Orleans and in other places, although the cultivation of commodities in the south was mainly sugar cane."
7908,17,louisiana,7908,"The French colonies of Louisiana contributed to exploration and outposts, concentrated along the shores of Mississippi and its main tributaries, from Louisiana to the north of the area known as Illinois, around St. Louis, Missouri, today."
7909,17,louisiana,7909,The latter was installed by French settlers in Illinois.
7910,17,louisiana,7910, Initially Mobile and then Biloxi served as the capital of La Louisiana.
7911,17,louisiana,7911," Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River for trade and military interests, and wishing to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civil and military authority in the south of the Great Lakes."
7912,17,louisiana,7912," From then on, until the United States acquired the territory in Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of Mississippi."
7913,17,louisiana,7913,"In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River in an area called the German coast."
7914,17,louisiana,7914,"France ceded most of its territory east of Mississippi in Great Britain in 1763, after Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War (generally called the French and Indian War in North America)."
7915,17,louisiana,7915,"The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, became a colony of Spain under the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)."
7916,17,louisiana,7916,The transfer of power on each side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.
7917,17,louisiana,7917,"In 1765, during Spanish domination, several thousand Francophone refugees from the Acadia region (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada) visited Louisiana after being expelled from their homeland by the British during the French and Indian War."
7918,17,louisiana,7918," They settled mainly in the southwestern region of Louisiana, now known as Acadiana."
7919,17,louisiana,7919," Governor Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, who wanted to win more settlers, welcomed the Acadian refugees, the ancestors of the Cajuns of Louisiana."
7920,17,louisiana,7920,"The Spanish Canary Islands, called Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783."
7921,17,louisiana,7921,"In 1800, Frenchman Napoleon Bonaparte took over Louisiana from Spain in the treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years."
7922,17,louisiana,7922,"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, carrying them from a French colony to the West Indies."
7923,17,louisiana,7923,"In 1709 French financier Antoine Crozat obtained a trade monopoly in La Louisiana, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois."
7924,17,louisiana,7924,"""This concession allowed him to bring a cargo of African blacks every year,"" writes British historian Hugh Thomas."
7925,17,louisiana,7925," Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh that there was high mortality among settlers and slaves, resulting in continued demand for and import of slaves."
7926,17,louisiana,7926," Starting in 1719, traders began importing more slaves; two French ships, Du Maine and Aurore, arrived in New Orleans and carried more than 500 black slaves from Africa."
7927,17,louisiana,7927,Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721 New Orleans had 1,256 inhabitants, almost half of whom were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724, the French government published a law called the Code Noir (""Code Noir"" in English) which ""regulates the interaction of white [white] and black [black] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much greater than the present state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law included 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, prohibited ""interracial"" marriages (those between people of different skin colour, whose varying nuances were also defined by law), restricted the Manumission, described the legal penalties imposed on slaves for various offences and defined certain obligations of owners towards their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main intention of the French government was to assert control over the system of agricultural slavery in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slave owners.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Black Code was extremely difficult to implement by far."
7933,17,louisiana,7933," Some priests continued to perform interracial wedding ceremonies, for example, and some slave owners continued to handle slaves without permission, while others brutally punished slaves."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Black Code of 1724 required the owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935, Sunday was a day of rest for the slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On the days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of them."
7937,17,louisiana,7937," During the economic crisis of the 1740s in the colony, the owners struggled to feed their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938," Giving them free time also gave more power to the slaves, who began to cultivate their own gardens and to make objects for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939," They began to participate in the economic development of the colony, while increasing their independence and autonomy."
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Black Code prohibits mixed marriages, prohibits mixed marriages, but hardly protects women slaves from the rape of their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941," Overall, the Code benefits the owners but has more protection and flexibility than the establishment of slavery in the 13 southern colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were rarely prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"The fugitive slaves, called marons, could easily hide in the bay's hinterland and survive in small colonies."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maroon"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", i.e. ""fugitive bovine""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"At the end of the 18th century, the last Spanish governor of Louisiana wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946," When the United States bought Louisiana in 1803, it was quickly accepted that African slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighbouring Mississippi, although it violated American law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947," Despite the demands of Rep. James Hillhouse of the United States and the brochure Thomas Paine to apply the federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the least expensive work."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small sugar producer with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Santo Domingo and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949," Shortly thereafter, he became an important sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations."
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, the first governor of the United States in Louisiana, stated that the work of African slaves was necessary because white workers ""can't have in this unhealthy climate."""
7951,17,louisiana,7951," Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to implement the abolition of the African slave trade, which the United States and Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastal trade, the shipping of slaves along the Atlantic coast to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"In 1840 New Orleans was the largest slave market in the United States, making a significant contribution to the economy of the city and the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,"New Orleans had become one of the richest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation."
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and the importation of slaves have increased demand in the internal market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"Over the decades since the American Revolutionary War, more than a million enslaved Africans have been forced to migrate from the South to the South, two thirds of them into the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957, Others were transported by their owners as the slaves moved westward for new land.
7958,17,louisiana,7958," With the evolution of agriculture in the Upper South as planters moved from tobacco to low-labour-intensive mixed farming, planters had surplus workers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959, Many sold slaves to traders to take them to the deep South.
7960,17,louisiana,7960, Slaves were driven by Upper South merchants or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by boat as part of the slave trade on the coast.
7961,17,louisiana,7961," After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations in Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,The occupation of Louisiana by Spain lasted from 1769 to 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963," From the 1790s, waves of immigration occurred in Santo Domingo, following a slave rebellion that began in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana on the island, including ethnic Europeans, people of free colour and African slaves, some of whom were brought by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965," They have greatly increased the Francophone population of New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and slaves have strengthened African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The process of independence in Santo Domingo was complex, but uprisings continued."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803, France withdrew its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two thirds sent to the island two years earlier, mainly with yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic of the Western Hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, obtained by slave leaders."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) said: ""Saint-Domingue was, of all our colonies in the West Indies, the one whose mentality and customs have most influenced Louisiana."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970," When the United States gained independence from Britain in 1783, one of its main concerns was to have a European power at its western border and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As the American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachians were obstructing the shipment of goods to the east."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship the products was to use a flat boat to float it in Ohio and Mississippi to the port of New Orleans, where the goods could be placed on oceanic ships."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this road was that the Spaniards had both sides of the Mississippi below Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974, Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana implied the creation of a new empire focused on the sugar trade in the Caribbean.
7975,17,louisiana,7975," Under the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain referred to the French for ownership of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe."
7976,17,louisiana,7976," Napoleon considered Louisiana as a deposit for these sugar islands, and as a buffer for the American colony."
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a major military force to take over Santo Domingo, then under the control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.When Napoleon Leclerc's army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to restore French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979," With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close Mississippi to the American trade at any time."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, American minister in France, to negotiate the purchase of the city of New Orleans, parts of the eastern shore of Mississippi, and the free navigation of the river for American trade."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston has been authorized to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer from Louisiana to the French property had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's understanding with the Spaniards was a poorly guarded secret at the border."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, the acting intendant of Louisiana, announced Spain's intention to revoke the deposit in New Orleans for all shipments originating in the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port in the United States has caused anger and dismay.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,"In the West, trade has been practically blocked."
7986,17,louisiana,7986," Historians believe that the revocation of the right of deposit was caused by the abuses committed by the Americans, in particular by smuggling, and not by the French intrigues, as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987," President Jefferson was unaware of public pressure for the war with France, and appointed James Monroe as special envoy to Napoleon to help secure New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson has also increased authorized expenditures to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989," However, on April 11, 1803 French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking him how willing the United States was to pay for the whole of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered it)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon could withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them without the possibility of obtaining the desired region of New Orleans), and that President Jefferson's approval could take months, so that Livingston and Monroe decided to open the negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"As at 30 April, they entered into a contract for the purchase of the entire territory of Louisiana of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for sixty million francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,"Part of this, $3.5 million, was used to repay France's debts to the United States."
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in U.S. bonds, which Napoleon sold in nominal value to the Dutch company Hope and Company, and to the British bank house in Baring, at a discount of 87 1⁄2 per $100."
7994,17,louisiana,7994," Consequently, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"English banker Alexander Baring confided Marbois in Paris, fled to the United States to recover the bonds, took them to Great Britain and returned to France with the money Napoleon used to wage war in the country of Baring."
7996,17,louisiana,7996," When news of the purchase came to the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,He had authorized an expenditure of $10 million for a port city and received treaties urging the government to spend $15 million on a set of lands that would double the size of the country.
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents to the Federalist Party argued that the purchase in Louisiana was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new lands or the negotiation of treaties without the consent of the Senator."
7999,17,louisiana,7999," What really worries the opposition is the new states that will inevitably be cut off from Louisiana territory, reinforcing Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England's federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000," President Jefferson has been a strong supporter of western expansion, and has stood firm in his support for the treaty."
8001,17,louisiana,8001," Despite federalist objections, the American Senate ratified the Treaty of Louisiana on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002," Under an act enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories transferred by France and to ensure initial governance."
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004," Since Louisiana territory had never been officially handed over to the French, the Spanish took off their flag, and the French raised their flag."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,"The next day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans in the United States."
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony took place in Saint-Louis on 9 March 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The following day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the First United States"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,The artillery marched its troops in the city and made the American flag go up the fort's pier.
8009,17,louisiana,8009," Louisiana Territory was officially transferred to the United States Government, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010," Louisiana's territory, purchased for less than three hundred per acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and created a precedent for the purchase of territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It paved the way for a possible expansion of the United States throughout the continent to the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012," Shortly after the seizure of possession of the United States, the region was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on 26 March 1804, thus organizing the territory of Orleans to the south and the district of Louisiana (later formed as the territory of Louisiana) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013," Louisiana became the eighteenth American state on April 30, 1812; the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana and the territory of Louisiana was simultaneously renamed the territory of Missouri."
8014,17,louisiana,8014,A region known as Florida Parishes was soon annexed to Louisiana on 14 April 1812.
8015,17,louisiana,8015," From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a two-party system, with the Democrats fighting first with the Whigs, then with the Know Nothings, and finally with the Democrats alone."
8016,17,louisiana,8016," According to the 1860 census, 331,726 persons were slaves, or nearly 47 per cent of the total population of the State (708,002)."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,The strong economic interest of the elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to separate from the Union on 26 January 1861.
8018,17,louisiana,8018,He followed other southern states in secession after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019,"The secession of Louisiana was announced on 26 January 1861, and became part of the Confederate States of America."
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated in the civil war, the result of the Union's strategy to cut Confederation in half by seizing Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,"The federal troops seized New Orleans on April 25, 1862."
8022,17,louisiana,8022," Because a large part of the population had sympathies with the Union (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives in the United States Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023,"As a result of the civil war and the emancipation of slaves, violence intensified in the South as the war was waged by private and paramilitary rebel groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024," Initially, state legislatures were dominated by the former Confederates, who adopted black codes to regulate free men and generally refused to vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025, They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).
8026,17,louisiana,8026," Following the Memphis riots of 1866 and the riot of New Orleans that same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted which provided the vote and full citizenship for the liberated men."
8027,17,louisiana,8027," Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for states where conditions were considered to be the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,She was regrouped with Texas in what was administered as the fifth military district.
8029,17,louisiana,8029, African-Americans have begun to live as citizens with a certain degree of equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030,"Free men and persons of colour who had been free before the war began to make more progress in education, family stability and employment."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was huge social volatility in the aftermath of the war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labour market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in the chapters of Ku Klux Klan."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"In 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, the white democrats of Louisiana and other states regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which abolished the black vote through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034," According to the example of Mississippi in 1890, in 1898, the white, democratic legislature, dominated by planters, adopted a new constitution that effectively deprived people of colour of their right to vote, raising obstacles to voter registration, such as voting taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect was immediate and long lasting.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the electoral lists and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the population of the State, which was also divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"In 1900, the population of the state was 47% African-American, a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038," Many in New Orleans were descendants of coloured Creoles, the considerable population of colourless people before the civil war."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"In 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the State."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"In 1910, there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 per cent of eligible African American men), despite the progress in education and literacy among blacks and people of colour."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and unable to serve in juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"The White Democrats established a one-party democratic regime, which they maintained in the state for decades deep in the 20th century until, after the passage by Congress of the 1965 Law on Voting Rights, Federal Control and the Application of the Constitutional Right to Vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration northward to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,The infestation of the plow and agricultural problems have cost many farmers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,Mechanization of agriculture has also reduced the need for workers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046," Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went to California for jobs in its expanding defence industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047," During part of the Great Depression, Louisiana was ruled by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected on a populist appeal.
8049,17,louisiana,8049," His public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased the vote for the poor whites, but Long was criticized for his so-called democratic and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He extended the control of favouritism to each branch of the Louisiana government.
8051,17,louisiana,8051, His plans to redistribute wealth in the State are particularly controversial.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule came to an abrupt end when he was murdered in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,Mobilization for the Second World War created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,"But thousands of other workers, black and white, have migrated to California to get better jobs in its booming defence industry."
8055,17,louisiana,8055," Many African-Americans left the state during the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s to the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had greatly reduced workers' needs.
8057,17,louisiana,8057," They sought qualified jobs in the defence industry in California, improved education for their children, and lived in communities where they could vote."
8058,17,louisiana,8058,"On November 26, 1958, at Chennault Air Force Base, a USAF B-47 nuclear-weapon bomber on board set fire to the ground."
8059,17,louisiana,8059,The wreckage of the aircraft and the accident site were contaminated after a limited explosion of non-nuclear material.
8060,17,louisiana,8060,"In the 1950s, the State created new conditions for the establishment of a citizenship criterion for voter registration."
8061,17,louisiana,8061," Despite opposition from the State Rights Party, low-state black voters have begun to increase their enrolment rates, which also reflects the growth of their middle class."
8062,17,louisiana,8062,"In 1960, the state established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation."
8063,17,louisiana,8063," Despite this, the registration and turnout of black voters has gradually increased to 20 per cent or more, and it was 32 per cent in 1964, when the first national legislation on civil rights at the time was adopted."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"The percentage of black voters varied considerably during these years, from 93.8% in the evangelical parish to 1.7% in the parish of Tensas, for example, where white efforts were made to suppress voting in the parish with a black majority."
8065,17,louisiana,8065,"Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill cities were the catalysts for the creation of the first two chapters of the Deacons for Defence and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, respectively, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa."
8066,17,louisiana,8066,"Composed of veterans of the Second World War and the Korean War, they were armed self-defence groups created to protect activists and their families."
8067,17,louisiana,8067,"In 1965, following the adoption of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal government ordered the local police to protect the activists."
8068,17,louisiana,8068," Other chapters were formed in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama."
8069,17,louisiana,8069,"In 1960, the proportion of African-Americans in Louisiana had dropped to 32%."
8070,17,louisiana,8070,"The 1,039,207 black citizens were still being repressed by segregation and exclusion."
8071,17,louisiana,8071, African-Americans continue to face disproportionate discriminatory application of the state's voter registration rules.
8072,17,louisiana,8072," Due to better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, Blacks continued to migrate out of Louisiana for a net loss of more than 37,000 people."
8073,17,louisiana,8073," According to official census figures, the Afro-American population in 1970 was 1,085,109 persons, a net gain of more than 46,000 persons compared to 1960."
8074,17,louisiana,8074," During this last period, some people began to migrate to New South cities to find opportunities."
8075,17,louisiana,8075," Since that time, blacks have entered the political system and begun to be elected to power, as well as to have other possibilities."
8076,17,louisiana,8076,"On 21 May 1919, the nineteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, giving women full voting rights, was adopted at the national level and was adopted on 18 August 1920 throughout the United States."
8077,17,louisiana,8077, Louisiana finally ratified the amendment on 11 June 1970.
8078,17,louisiana,8078," Because of its location on the Gulf coast, Louisiana has regularly suffered from the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes."
8079,17,louisiana,8079,"On August 29, 2005, New Orleans and many other lower parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were struck by catastrophic hurricane Katrina."
8080,17,louisiana,8080,It caused much damage as a result of the breakup of dykes and large-scale flooding of more than 80 per cent of the city.
8081,17,louisiana,8081," Officials have issued warnings to evacuate the city and surrounding areas, but tens of thousands of people, most of them African Americans, have remained behind, many of whom have failed."
8082,17,louisiana,8082, Many people have died and survivors have suffered from the damage caused by the floods.
8083,17,louisiana,8083,"In July 2016, the shooting of Alton Sterling sparked demonstrations throughout the state capital of Baton Rouge."
8084,17,louisiana,8084,"In August 2016, an unnamed storm poured billions of gallons of rain into southern Louisiana, including the cities of Denham Springs, Baton Rouge, Gonzales, Saint-Amant and Lafayette, causing catastrophic flooding."

8091,17,louisiana,8091, Louisiana entered the first phase of state recovery on May 15.
8092,17,louisiana,8092,"On June 4, Governor John Bel Edwards signed an Order-in-Council for the second phase."
8093,17,louisiana,8093,- That's the government.
8094,17,louisiana,8094,"Edwards extended the second phase to September 11, and the third phase began with speculation on October 9."
8095,17,louisiana,8095, Louisiana is bordered west by Texas
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The state can well be divided into two parts, the northern highlands, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial area includes low marshlands, coastal marshes and beaches, as well as barrier islands that cover approximately 20,000 square miles (32,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098," This region is mainly along the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi, which crosses the state from north to south for a distance of about 600 mi (970 km) and flows into the Gulf of Mexico; the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The width of the alluvial region along Mississippi is 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100 km), and along the other rivers the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15 km)."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as leve), from which the land declines to a river beyond an average fall of six feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,Alluvial lands along other watercourses have similar characteristics.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The highest and contiguous hills in the north and north-west of the state have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103, These are meadows and forests.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,Altitudes above sea level range from 10 feet (3 m) on the coast and marshland to 50-60 feet (15-18 m) on grasslands and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the highlands and hills, altitudes rise to Driskill Mountain, the highest point of the state at only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106," From 1932 to 2010, the state lost 1,800 square miles due to sea level increases and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPAR) spends approximately $1 billion annually to assist in the establishment and protection of the shores and lands of Louisiana through federal and state funding.
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"In addition to the previously named streams, there is Sabine, which forms the western boundary; and Pearl, the eastern boundary; Calcasieu, Mermentau, Vermilion, Bayou Teche, Atchafalaya, Boeuf, Bayou Lafourche, Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, Macon River, Tensas, Amite River, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Natalbany River, and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural network of navigable rivers, with a length of over 4,000 miles (6,400 km)."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The State also has political jurisdiction over the portion of approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) of inland continental shelf underwater land in the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110," Because of a particular feature of the political geography of the United States, it is a territory far less than the 14-km-wide jurisdiction of the neighbouring states of Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have vast Gulf coasts."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is one of the fastest disappearing areas in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112, This is largely due to poor human management of the coast (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one point, the land was added as spring floods of the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated the growth of the marshes; the land is shrinking today."
8114,17,louisiana,8114, There are multiple causes.
8115,17,louisiana,8115, Artificial dikes block spring floodwater that would bring fresh water and sediment into the marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"The marshes have been extensively exploited, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move seawaters inward, damaging swamps and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,The increase in sea water has exacerbated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119, Some researchers estimate that the state loses land mass equivalent to 30 football fields per day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120," Many proposals are aimed at saving coastal areas by reducing human damage, including the rehabilitation of natural floods in Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121," Without this restoration, the coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as communities disappear, more and more people leave the area."
8123,17,louisiana,8123," Since coastal wetlands support an economically significant inshore fishery, the loss of wetlands negatively affects this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,The Gulf of Mexico 'dead zone' off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"In 2017, this was the highest record ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico did not exist 250 million years ago while there was only one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As Pangea splits, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico open."
8128,17,louisiana,8128," Louisiana has gradually developed over millions of years from water to land, and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,"The oldest rocks are exposed to the north, in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest."
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date from the beginning of the Cenozoic era, 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,The history of the formation of these rocks is found in Louisiana's D. Spearing's Roadside Geology.
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest parts of the state have been formed over the past 12,000 years as successive deltas of the Mississippi River: the Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, the modern Mississippi, and now the Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133, These sediments were transported from north to south through the Mississippi River.
8134,17,louisiana,8134," Between the tertiary rocks of the north and the relatively new sediments along the coast, is a vast belt known as Terrasses du Pleistocene."
8135,17,louisiana,8135, Their age and distribution may be largely related to sea-level rise and fall in recent ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had enough time for rivers to cut deep canals, while the more recent terraces tend to be much flattering."
8137,17,louisiana,8137, Salt domes are also found in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138," Their origin dates back to the early Gulf of Mexico, when the shallow ocean experienced high rates of evaporation."
8139,17,louisiana,8139," There are hundreds of salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140, Salty domes are important not only as a source of salt
8141,17,louisiana,8141," Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long, warm, humid summers and short, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low elongated topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its furthest point is not more than 200 mi (320 km)."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rain is common throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state wet season."
8144,17,louisiana,8144, There's a fall in precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, the storms are built during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief tropical rains."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June to September, with an average of 90°F (32°C) or higher, and night hollows above 70°F (21°C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148," Sometimes temperatures in the 1990s F, combined with dew points in the higher 70s F, create reasonable temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The wet, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and films."
8150,17,louisiana,8150,"The temperatures are generally warm in winter in the southern part of the state, with peaks around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico on average 66°F (19°C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the condition is slightly cool in winter, with average levels of 59°F (15°C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152,"The low winter nights are on average well above freezing in the whole state, with 46°F (8°C) average near the Gulf and an average low of 37°F (3°C) in winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153," Occasionally, the cold fronts of the low pressure centres in the north reach Louisiana in winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154," Low temperatures near 20°F (−7°C) occur occasionally in the northern part of the state, but rarely in the southern part of the state."
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although people in the northern part of the state can receive snow dust a few times a decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"The highest recorded temperature in Louisiana was 114°F (46°C) in Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature was −16°F (−27°C) in Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157," Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to the strikes of major hurricanes, especially the lowlands around and in the New Orleans region."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can cause damage to water through a large area from major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The region is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state is on average more than 60 days of storms per year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161, Louisiana has an average of 27 tornadoes annually.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The whole State is vulnerable to a tornado, with the southern extreme of the State slightly less than the rest of the State."
8163,17,louisiana,8163, tornadoes are more frequent from January to March in the southern part of the State and from February to March in the northern part of the State.
8164,17,louisiana,8164," Because of its location and geology, the state has a great biodiversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165," Some vital areas, such as the southwest prairie, have lost more than 98 per cent."
8166,17,louisiana,8166," Flat pine woods are also at great risk, mainly due to fire suppression and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167, There is not yet a well-organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168," Such a system would be a protected system of central areas linked by biological corridors, as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169," Louisiana includes a number of areas which, to varying degrees, prevent people from using them."
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to the areas of the U.S. National Parks Service and a national forest, Louisiana operates a network of state parks, state historic sites, a state conservation area, a state forest and many wildlife management areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of the largest public areas of Louisiana is the Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172," Its area is about 600,000 acres, more than half of which are flat forests with many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173, These include the Louisiana Pine Snake and the Red Peacock Woodpecker.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The government-owned cypress swamp system around Pontchartrain Lake is another large area, with southern wetland species, including scratches, alligators and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 base areas would be required to build a ""protected area system"" for the state; these would be southwestern grasslands, the Pearl River floodplain to the east, and alluvial marshes of the Mississippi River in the north."
8176,17,louisiana,8176," Historic or picturesque areas otherwise managed, protected or otherwise recognized by the National Parks Service include:"
8177,17,louisiana,8177," Louisiana operates a network of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and a state preservation zone."
8178,17,louisiana,8178," Louisiana has 955,973 acres in four ecoregions under wildlife management in Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries."
8179,17,louisiana,8179,The Nature Conservancy owns and manages a range of natural areas.
8180,17,louisiana,8180,"The Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System provides a degree of protection for 51 rivers, streams, and bayous rivers in the state."
8181,17,louisiana,8181,It is administered by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fishing.
8182,17,louisiana,8182," Louisiana has 308 incorporated municipalities consisting of four consolidated parish cities and 304 cities, towns and villages."
8183,17,louisiana,8183," Louisiana's municipalities cover only 7.9 per cent of the state's surface area, but account for 45.3 per cent of its population."

8207,17,louisiana,8207," Increasing from the 2010 and 2014 censuses, Hispanics or Latinos of any race accounted for 5.1% of Louisiana's population in 2018."
8208,17,louisiana,8208," Mexican Americans (2.0%), Puerto Ricans (0.3%) and Cubans (0.2%) were the largest in Latin America."

8216,17,louisiana,8216," Because of the French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants the Creoles, and later the Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and the Greater New Orleans region are mainly Catholics."
8217,17,louisiana,8217," Since the Creoles were the first settlers, planters and rulers of the territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics."
8218,17,louisiana,8218,"For example, the majority of first governors were Creole Catholics."
8219,17,louisiana,8219," Because Catholics still constitute a large portion of Louisiana's population, they have continued to have an influence on state policy."
8220,17,louisiana,8220,The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population make Louisiana distinct between the southern states.

8225,17,louisiana,8225," Louisiana was one of the southern states with a large Jewish population before the 20th century; Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia also had influential Jewish populations in some of their large cities of the 18th and 19th centuries."
8226,17,louisiana,8226,The first Jewish settlers were sefarate Jews who immigrated with British settlers from London.
8227,17,louisiana,8227," Later in the 19th century, German Jews began to immigrate, followed by those from Eastern Europe and the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."

8280,17,louisiana,8280,"The conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were not suitable for certain crops known to settlers, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281,The settlers and the slaves they import have high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"Settlers continued to import slaves, resulting in a high proportion of West Africans who continued to practice their culture in a new environment."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As described by historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, they developed an African-Creole culture marked in colonial times."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a significant influx of white and Métis refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285," This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in Santo Domingo came from Africa than in the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286," They have strongly influenced the city's Afro-American culture in terms of dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is a mix of French, African, Spanish (and other European) and Amerindian cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word crioulo; originally it referred to a colonist of European origin (specifically French) born in the New World, compared with immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289," Louisiana's oldest manuscript to use the word ""Creole"", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,"But, initially, he referred more generally to French settlers born in Louisiana."
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, a relatively large group of Creoles de Couleur (free-coloured people) developed in the French colony, mainly descended from African slaves and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mixture, as well as some Amerindians)."
8292,17,louisiana,8292,"The French often freed their concubines and Métis children, and passed on social capital to them."
8293,17,louisiana,8293,"For example, they could educate sons of France and help them enter the French army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294, They have also established assets or capital assets on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295,The colour-free population has gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education
8296,17,louisiana,8296, Many of them became craftsmen and owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""Creole"" became associated with this class of Colour Creoles, many of which reached freedom well before the civil war."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,Rich French Creoles generally maintained townhouses in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside the city along the Mississippi.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans has the largest population of colour-free people in the region; they can find work there and create their own culture, marrying each other for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"Cajuns' ancestors immigrated mainly from western central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally known as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301," After the British defeat of France in the French and Indian War (seven-year war) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of Mississippi to Great Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated the families and expelled them from Acadia because they refused to give their loyalty to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304," Some, who escaped from the British, remained in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305," Others have dispersed in France, Canada, Mexico and the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306, Many Acadian refugees settled in southern Louisiana in the region of Lafayette and the country of LaFourche Bayou.
8307,17,louisiana,8307," They developed a separate rural culture, different from the French Creole settlers of New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"By marrying others in the area, they developed what is called music, cooking and Cajun culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309," Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered to be somewhat derogatory."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,"In Louisiana, a third distinct culture is that of the Isleños."
8311,17,louisiana,8311," Its members were descendants of settlers from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and married other communities such as the French, Acadians, Creoles, Spaniards and other groups, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, the Isleños originally settled in four communities, including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313," Among these colonies, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most prosperous because the other two were both plagued by disease and flooding."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,"The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community, while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) managed to preserve much of its unique culture and language in the 21st century."
8315,17,louisiana,8315," That being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs completely stopped in St. Bernard with those with competence in Spanish being octagenary."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Over the centuries, the various communities of Isleño de Louisiana have kept alive various elements of their heritage of the Canary Islands while adopting and relying on the customs and traditions of the communities around them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317," Today, two heritage partners exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard and the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana."
8318,17,louisiana,8318,"The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated every year in the parish of Saint-Bernard, which presents heritage representations of local groups and the Canary Islands."

8320,17,louisiana,8320," Historically, the Amerindian peoples of the region at the time of the European encounter were seven tribes characterized by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321," Among them, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have live indigenous speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322," Other Amerindian peoples have emigrated to the region, escaping from Eastern European pressure."
8323,17,louisiana,8323," Among them were the people of Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati and Ofo."
8324,17,louisiana,8324, From the 1700s French settlers began to settle along the coast and found New Orleans.
8325,17,louisiana,8325, They have established institutions of French culture and language.
8326,17,louisiana,8326," They imported thousands of slaves from West African tribes, who spoke several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the process of Creolization, the slaves developed a Creole dialect of Louisiana incorporating both French and African forms, which the settlers adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, in particular, who spoke of the Louisiana Creole."
8329,17,louisiana,8329," During the 19th century after the purchase of Louisiana by the United States, English gradually gained importance for business and government because of population change with the establishment by many Americans who were English-speaking."

8333,17,louisiana,8333,The subsequent state constitutions reflect the decreasing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The Constitution of 1868, adopted at the time of the reconstruction before the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, prohibited laws requiring the publication of judicial proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335," Subsequently, the legal status of French was somewhat restored, but it never regained its importance before the civil war."
8336,17,louisiana,8336," Several unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana."

8338,17,louisiana,8338, Louisiana Créole French is the term of one of the Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339," Two unique dialects developed from the English language: Louisiana English, a variety of English with French influence in which the fall of /r/ post-vocal is common; and what is unofficially known as Yat, which resembles the New York City dialect sometimes with southern influences, especially that of historic Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340," These two accents were influenced by large Irish and Italian immigrant communities, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341, Colonial French was the dominant language of white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period.
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, Métis people and slaves developed Creole Louisiana, with a base in West African languages."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish domination at the end of the 18th century did not lead to widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"The French Creole and Louisiana are still used in modern Louisiana, often in family gatherings."
8345,17,louisiana,8345,"English and its dialects became predominant after the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, after which the area became dominated by many Anglophones."
8346,17,louisiana,8346,"In some areas, English is influenced by French, as can be seen from Louisiana's English."
8347,17,louisiana,8347," Colonial French, although mistakenly named Cajun French by a few Cajuns, persisted alongside English."
8348,17,louisiana,8348,"The renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the creation of Canadian-style French immersion schools, as well as bilingual signage in the French historic neighbourhoods of New Orleans and Lafayette."
8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the State has maintained the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which encourages the use of the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and the international relations of the State."

8392,17,louisiana,8392," Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law had common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code had never been in force in Louisiana, as it had been enacted in 1804, after the United States had purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803."

8395,17,louisiana,8395," While some of these differences have been filled by the strong influence of the common law tradition, the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana's private law."

8904,19,maryland,8904,"In 1704, the Maryland General Assembly prohibited Catholics from operating schools, limited the collective ownership of property to hinder the expansion or support of religious orders, and encouraged the conversion of Catholic children."
8905,19,maryland,8905,The celebration of Catholic sacraments was also officially restricted.
8906,19,maryland,8906, This state of affairs lasted until after the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
8907,19,maryland,8907,Rich Catholic planters built chapels on their lands to practice their religion in relative secrecy.
8908,19,maryland,8908,"In the 18th century, lay priests and leaders claimed the Jesuit-owned farms of Maryland as personal property and bequeathed them to avoid legal restrictions on property belonging to religious organizations."
8909,19,maryland,8909,The Royal Charter granted Maryland the lands north of the Potomac River until the 40th parallel.
8910,19,maryland,8910,A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania.
8911,19,maryland,8911,"The subsidy defined the southern border of Pennsylvania as identical to the northern border of Maryland, the 40th parallel."
8912,19,maryland,8912,"But the grant indicated that Charles II and William Penn assumed that the 40th parallel would pass near New Castle, Delaware when it fell north of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already chosen the capital of his colony."
8913,19,maryland,8913, Negotiations followed after the discovery of the problem in 1681.
8914,19,maryland,8914,A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682 was undermined by the fact that Penn received the additional award of what is now Delaware.
8915,19,maryland,8915,"Penn successfully argued that the Maryland Charter, Lord Baltimore, applied only to unoccupied lands, and that Dutch colonization at Delaware predates its charter."
8916,19,maryland,8916,"The dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century, pursued by the descendants of William Penn and Lord Baltimore, the Calvert family, which controlled Maryland, and the Penn family, which controlled Pennsylvania."
8917,19,maryland,8917,The border dispute with Pennsylvania led to the Cresap War in the 1730s.
8918,19,maryland,8918,"The hostilities broke out in 1730 and intensified in the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and Pennsylvania in 1737."
8919,19,maryland,8919,"The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who imposed the negotiation of a cease-fire."
8920,19,maryland,8920,A provisional agreement had been in place in 1732.
8921,19,maryland,8921,The negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760.

8923,19,maryland,8923,The border of Maryland with Delaware rests on a transpennine line and the circle of twelve miles around the new castle.
8924,19,maryland,8924," Most of the English settlers arrived in Maryland as contracted servants, and had to fulfill a mandate of several years as workers to pay for their passage."
8925,19,maryland,8925,"In the early years, the line between contract servants and African slaves or workers was fluid, and white and black workers generally lived and worked together, and formed unions."
8926,19,maryland,8926," Mixed-bred children born to white mothers are considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, whereby children take on the social status of their mother, a principle of the Slave Law which was adopted in all colonies, after Virginia in 1662."
8927,19,maryland,8927," During the colonial period, families of free people of colour were formed most often by unions of white women and African men."
8928,19,maryland,8928," Many free black families migrated to Delaware, where land was cheaper."
8929,19,maryland,8929,"As the flow of contract workers to the colony declined with the improvement of economic conditions in England, the planters of Maryland imported thousands of other hardened slaves and lineages of racial castes."
8930,19,maryland,8930,"The growth and prosperity of the economy was based on slave labour, first devoted to tobacco production as a basic crop."
8931,19,maryland,8931,Maryland was one of the thirteen colonies that rebelled against British rule during the American Revolution.
8932,19,maryland,8932," Towards the end of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), on 2 February 1781, Maryland became the last and 13th state to approve the ratification of the statutes of the Confederation and the perpetual Union, first proposed in 1776 and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in 1778, which made the United States a united, sovereign and national State."
8933,19,maryland,8933,It also became the seventh State admitted to the Union after ratifying the new Federal Constitution in 1788.
8934,19,maryland,8934,"In December 1790 Maryland donated lands selected by First President George Washington to the federal government for the creation of Washington's new national capital, D.C."
8935,19,maryland,8935,"Land was provided along the north shore of the Potomac River from the counties of Montgomery and Prince George, as well as Fairfax and Alexandria County on the south shore of the Potomac River in Virginia; however, land donated by the Commonwealth of Virginia was later returned to that state by the District of Columbia retrocession in 1846."
8936,19,maryland,8936,"Influenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals and preaching by ministers, many planters in Maryland liberated their slaves within 20 years of the revolutionary war."
8937,19,maryland,8937," Throughout the Upper South, the free black population rose from less than 1% before the war to 14% in 1810."

8939,19,maryland,8939," During the War of 1812, the British army attempted to capture Baltimore, which was protected by Fort McHenry."
8940,19,maryland,8940," During this bombing, the song ""Star Spangled Banner"" was written by Francis Scott Key; it was then adopted as a national anthem."

8943,19,maryland,8943,"It opened its first track section for regular operation in 1830 between Baltimore and Ellicott City, and in 1852 became the first railway line to reach the Ohio River from the east coast."
8944,19,maryland,8944,"The state remained with the Union during the civil war, largely because of demography and federal intervention."
8945,19,maryland,8945,"The 1860 census, held shortly before the outbreak of the civil war, showed that 49% of the African Americans in Maryland were free Blacks."
8946,19,maryland,8946," Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks suspended the state's legislature and, in order to help secure the election of a new governor and legislature in favour of union, President Abraham Lincoln arrested a number of his slavery-loving politicians, including Baltimore Mayor George William Brown; suspended several civil liberties, including habeas corpus; and ordered the installation of artillery on the Federal Hill overlooking Baltimore."
8947,19,maryland,8947," Historians are debating the constitutionality of these acts in times of war, and the suspension of civil liberties is later found illegal by the Supreme Court of the United States."
8948,19,maryland,8948,"In April 1861, federal units and state regiments were attacked as they passed through Baltimore, causing the Baltimore riot in 1861, the first bloodbath of the civil war."
8949,19,maryland,8949,"Of the 115 000 men in Maryland who joined the army during the civil war, 85,000, or 77%, joined the Union army, while the others joined the Confederate army."
8950,19,maryland,8950,"The Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, was the most important and important battle in the state."
8951,19,maryland,8951," Although tactical, the battle was considered a strategic victory for the Union and a turning point in the war."
8952,19,maryland,8952,"A new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a ""free state"" in that context."
8953,19,maryland,8953," Following the adoption of constitutional amendments granting the right to vote to men who were released in 1867, the state extended the vote to non-white men."
8954,19,maryland,8954,The Democratic Party quickly regained power in the Republican state.
8955,19,maryland,8955,The Democrats replaced the Constitution of 1864 by the Constitution of 1867.
8956,19,maryland,8956," After the reconstruction ended in 1877, the Democrats developed ways to deprive blacks of their right to vote, first through physical intimidation and electoral fraud, then through constitutional amendments and laws."
8957,19,maryland,8957,"Blacks and immigrants, however, resisted the Democratic Party's efforts to emancipate the State."
8958,19,maryland,8958,The Blacks of Maryland were part of a biracial republican coalition elected to the state government in 1896–04 and represented 20% of the electorate.

8961,19,maryland,8961, Half the population lives in the city.
8962,19,maryland,8962," Literacy was high among blacks and, as democrats designed ways to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped to reach out to blacks and teach them how to resist."
8963,19,maryland,8963,"Whites effectively imposed racial segregation in public institutions and Jim Crow's laws, which lasted until federal civil rights legislation was enacted in the mid-1960s."
8964,19,maryland,8964,"Baltimore experienced significant growth during the industrial revolution, largely thanks to its seaport and good rail links, attracting the European immigrant workforce."

8969,19,maryland,8969,The progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought about political reforms.
8970,19,maryland,8970,"In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by parties); obtained closed polling stations to prevent party workers from assisting voters; launched primary elections to prevent party bosses from selecting candidates; and had registered candidates without party symbols, which discouraged illiterates from participating."
8971,19,maryland,8971, These measures targeted poorly educated whites and blacks.
8972,19,maryland,8972,"The Blacks resisted such efforts, with groups of votes leading the education of voters.The Blacks defeated three efforts to refuse them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various democratic campaigns."
8973,19,maryland,8973,"In 1905, 1907 and 1911, bills on the abandonment of the right to vote were rejected, largely because of the black opposition."
8974,19,maryland,8974,"Blacks accounted for 20 per cent of the electorate and immigrants 15 per cent, and legislators had difficulty designing requirements against blacks who also did not disadvantage immigrants."
8975,19,maryland,8975,The progressive era has also brought reforms to the working conditions of Maryland's labour force.
8976,19,maryland,8976,"In 1902, the State regulated conditions in mines; prohibited child workers under the age of 12; prescribed compulsory school attendance; and promulgated the first national workers' compensation law."

8981,19,maryland,8981," Existing facilities, including Fort McHenry, have been significantly expanded."
8982,19,maryland,8982," After Georgian MP William D. Upshaw openly criticized Maryland in 1923 for not passing prohibition laws, Baltimore Sun's editor, Hamilton Owens, invented the nickname ""Free State"" for Maryland in this context, which was popularized by H. L. Mencken in a series of newspaper editorials."

8988,19,maryland,8988,Maryland experienced population growth following World War II.
8989,19,maryland,8989," Beginning in the 1960s, while suburban growth was taking place around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to adopt a more mid-Atlantic culture, contrary to the traditional southern and tidewater culture that once dominated most of the state."
8990,19,maryland,8990," Agricultural sectors have given way to residential communities, some of which have been carefully planned, such as Columbia, St. Charles and Montgomery Village."

8996,19,maryland,8996,"On the Lower East Shore, family farms were bought out by major concerns and large poultry farms and vegetable farming became widespread."
8997,19,maryland,8997,"In southern Maryland, tobacco farming has almost disappeared as a result of the development of the suburbs and a tobacco buying program by the state in the 1990s."
8998,19,maryland,8998,"In an effort to reverse the depopulation caused by the loss of workers' industries, Baltimore undertook urban renewal projects in the 1960s with Charles Center and the Baltimore World Trade Center."
8999,19,maryland,8999," Some have led to the break-up of intact residential neighbourhoods, resulting in social volatility, and some older residential neighbourhoods around the harbour have had renovated units and have become popular with new populations."
9000,19,maryland,9000,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Maryland population was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 4.71% since the 2010 U.S. Census and an increase of 2,962 over the previous year."
9001,19,maryland,9001," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 269,166 (464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people to the State."
9002,19,maryland,9002,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 129,730 persons, and internal migration resulted in a net loss of 13,017 persons."

9004,19,maryland,9004,The history of Maryland as a border state has led her to present the characteristics of the northern and southern parts of the United States.
9005,19,maryland,9005,"In general, the rural western Maryland between the Panhandle of West Virginia and Pennsylvania has an Appalachian culture; the regions of the south shore and east of Maryland embody a South culture, while the densely populated central Maryland — radiating outwards from Baltimore and Washington, D.C. — is more common than that of the northeast.The U.S. Census Bureau designates Maryland as one of the states of the South Atlantic, but is generally associated with the States of the Middle Atlantic and/or the Northeast of the United States by other federal agencies, the media and some residents."

9007,19,maryland,9007,"Note: Births in the table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, resulting in a higher overall number."

9012,19,maryland,9012," Historically, these and many other cities in Maryland have developed along the autumn line, the line along which rivers, streams and streams are interrupted by rapids and/or waterfalls."
9013,19,maryland,9013,"The capital of Maryland, Annapolis, is an exception to this pattern, as it lies along the banks of the Severn River near the point where it flows into Chesapeake Bay."
9014,19,maryland,9014,"The east coast is less populated and more rural, as are the counties of western Maryland."
9015,19,maryland,9015,"The two counties west of Maryland, Allegany and Garrett, are mountainous and sparsely populated, more like Western Virginia and Appalachia than the rest of the state."
9016,19,maryland,9016,"The east and west of Maryland, however, are dotted with cities of regional importance, such as Ocean City, Princess Anne and Salisbury on the East Coast and Cumberland, Frostburg and Hancock in West Maryland.The south Maryland is still somewhat rural, but Washington's suburbs have been intruding significantly since the 1960s; major local population centres include Lexington Park, Prince Frederick, California and Waldorf."

9023,19,maryland,9023," Many immigrants from the Horn of Africa settled in Maryland, where large communities exist in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. (especially Montgomery County and Prince George County) and in the city of Baltimore."
9024,19,maryland,9024,The Greater Washington area has the largest population of Ethiopians outside Africa.
9025,19,maryland,9025,"The Ethiopian Greater DC community was historically based in Washington, D.C.'s Adams Morgan and Shaw neighbourhoods, but as the community developed, many Ethiopians settled in Silver Spring."

9029,19,maryland,9029,"Smaller but much older Irish populations are found in southern Maryland, some of whose roots date back to the first colony of Maryland."
9030,19,maryland,9030," However, the population remains very culturally active and annual festivals are held."

9042,19,maryland,9042," Although the Salvadoran population is more concentrated in the Washington, D.C. region, and the Puerto Rican population is more concentrated in the Baltimore region, all other major Hispanic groups in the State are also dispersed between these two areas."

9055,19,maryland,9055,Maryland has always played an important role in the American Catholic tradition because the English colony of Maryland was designed by George Calvert as a refuge for English Catholics.

10723,23,mississippi,10723, Two of the five most deadly tornadoes in United States history occurred in the State.
10724,23,mississippi,10724, These storms struck Natchez in the southwest of Mississippi (see The Great Natchez Tornado) and Tupelo in the northeast corner of the state.

10732,23,mississippi,10732,"The rest of the state, mainly north of Interstate 20, excluding the Prairie regions, consists of mixed pine and hardwood forests, common lobolly pines, oaks (e.g., water oaks), hickories, sweetgum, and elms."
10733,23,mississippi,10733," Areas bordering large rivers are generally inhabited by bald cypress, water tupelo, water elm and bitter pecan."

10741,23,mississippi,10741," Mississippi is home to 63 species of crayfish, at least 17 of which are endemic."
10742,23,mississippi,10742, Mississippi is home to eight species of winter sandstone.
10743,23,mississippi,10743," Due to seasonal flooding, possible from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile flood plain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744," Floods in the river created natural dikes, which the planters had built earlier to try to prevent flooding of cultivated land for cotton crops."
10745,23,mississippi,10745, Temporary workers built dykes along the Mississippi River over the natural dykes that formed from land deposited after the flood of the river.
10746,23,mississippi,10746," From 1858 to 1861, the State assumed responsibility for the construction of dykes, carrying out it through contractors and employees."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters considered their slaves to be too valuable to hire them for such a dangerous job."
10748,23,mississippi,10748, Entrepreneurs have hired Irish immigrant bands to build dykes and sometimes clear land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749,A large number of Irish were relatively recent immigrants from years of famine who struggled to settle.
10750,23,mississippi,10750," Prior to the U.S. Civil War, the earth dams had an average height of six feet, although in some areas they had reached 20 feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751," Floods have been an integral part of Mississippi's history, but clearing land for the cultivation and supply of wood to steamboats has removed the absorption of trees and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river were stripped naked, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753," After the civil war, major flooding devastated the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754," These floods regularly overflowed the dikes damaged by the Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those built after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties."
10756,23,mississippi,10756,"In 1879, the United States Congress established the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included helping the state dykes build dykes."
10757,23,mississippi,10757,"At the end of the 19th century, white and black temporary workers were hired to build the dykes."
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"By 1882 the dikes had an average height of seven feet, but many in the southern delta were severely affected by the flooding that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759," After the flood of 1882, the system of dykes was extended."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the district of Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee was created to oversee the construction and maintenance of the dykes in the northern counties of the delta; there were also some Arkansas counties that were part of the delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761," Floods submerged the northwest of Mississippi in 1912-13, causing serious damage to the dyke districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,The regional losses and lobbying of the Mississippi River Levee Association for a flood control bill contributed to the passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local dike districts on a scale of 2:1.
10763,23,mississippi,10763," Although U.S. participation in the First World War interrupted the financing of the dikes, the second funding cycle helped raise the average height of the dikes in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764, Scientists now understand that dykes have increased flood severity by increasing the flow rate of the river and reducing the floodplain area.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The area was severely damaged by the Mississippi flood in 1927, which crossed the dykes."
10766,23,mississippi,10766," Millions of dollars have been lost in property, inventory and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The greatest damage occurred in the lower delta, including the counties of Washington and Bolivar."
10768,23,mississippi,10768," Although scientific knowledge on Mississippi has developed, upstream development and the consequences of dykes have caused more severe flooding in some years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769, Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and the construction of dykes have altered the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770," This work has resulted in the elimination of natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, thereby strengthening the flow of the river."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The federal and state governments are struggling for the best approaches to restoring certain natural habitats to better interact with the original riparian ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772," Nearly 10,000 Indians from British Columbia or Paleo-Indians have arrived in what is now known as the South American."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,The Southern Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that disappeared after the late Pleistocene age.
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Amerindian colonies and agricultural fields have been developed on natural dikes, higher land near rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Amerindians developed vast fields near their permanent village.
10776,23,mississippi,10776," Along with other practices, they created some localized deforestation, but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777," After thousands of years, the successive cultures of the timber and Mississippi eras have developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which the surplus has fostered the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778, Both were mound builder cultures.
10779,23,mississippi,10779,"The ones in Mississippi culture were the largest and most complex, built from about 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,"People had a commercial network covering the continent, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf coast."
10781,23,mississippi,10781," Their great terrestrial works, expressing their cosmology of political and religious concepts, are still in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys."
10782,23,mississippi,10782, Native American tribes of the descendants of Mississippi culture in the southeast include the Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783," Other tribes that lived in Mississippi (and whose names were honoured by settlers in local towns) include Natchez, Yazoo and Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition to the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, Hernando de Soto, who passed to the north-eastern part of the state in 1540, on his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French settlers established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built in the vicinity of today's Ocean Springs, on the Gulf coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was installed by Pierre Le Moyne of Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,"In 1716, the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (under the name of Fort Rosalie), and became the dominant city and trading post of the region."
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the largest territory ""New France""; the Spaniards continued to claim part of the Gulf Coast region (east of Mobile Bay) of the present-day southern Alabama, in addition to the entire Florida region."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"In the 18th century, the region was governed by colonial governments in Spain, France and the United Kingdom."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,The settlers imported African slaves as workers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791," Under the French and Spanish rule, there has been the development of a class of free people of colour (people of free colour), mainly multiracial descendants of European men and black women enslaved or free, and their Métis children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,"In the early days, French and Spanish settlers were mainly men."
10793,23,mississippi,10793," While more and more European women have joined the colonies, men have race unions among women of African descent (and increasingly of multiracial ancestry), before and after the marriage of European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"European men often help their multiracial children to learn or to acquire apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settle on them; they often free mothers and their children if they are slaves, under placarding contracts."
10795,23,mississippi,10795," With this social capital, the people free of colour have become artisans, and sometimes educated traders and real estate owners, forming a third class between Europeans and the most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish colonies, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796," After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (seven-year war), the French gave up the Mississippi region to them under the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797," They also divest their areas north to the east of Mississippi, including Illinois and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798," After the peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi passed under Spanish domination as part of western Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819, the United States completed the purchase of Western Florida and all Eastern Florida under the Adams-Onís Treaty, and in 1822 the two were merged into Florida territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800," After the American Revolution (1765-1783), Britain gave up the area to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801," Mississippi was organized on 7 April 1798, from the territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States."
10802,23,mississippi,10802, Their original colonial charters extended theoretically westward to the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803,The territory of Mississippi was subsequently expanded twice to include the disputed territory claimed by the United States and Spain.
10804,23,mississippi,10804," From about 1800 to 1830, the United States purchased land (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Native American tribes for new European American colonies."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mostly migrants from other southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were depleted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,"New settlers were continually encroaching on the lands of Choctaw, and they urged the federal government to expel the Amerindians."
10807,23,mississippi,10807,"On September 27, 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the United States government and the Choctaw."
10808,23,mississippi,10808,The Choctaws agreed to sell their traditional lands in Mississippi and Alabama for compensation and removal of reserves in Indian territory (now Oklahoma).
10809,23,mississippi,10809, This has opened up land for sale to the establishment of Euro-American migrants.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 of the Treaty allows Choctaws who choose to remain in states to become American citizens, as they are considered to abandon their tribal affiliation."
10811,23,mississippi,10811," They were the second largest American Aboriginal ethnic group to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas during the period rather than join the abduction)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812," Today, their descendants number about 9,500 people who identify themselves as Choctaw, and who live in the counties of Neshoba, Newton, Leake and Jones."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band was reorganized in the twentieth century and is a tribe recognized by the federal government.
10814,23,mississippi,10814," Many slaves brought African-American slaves with them or bought them through the domestic slave trade, especially in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"As a result of this trade, it is estimated that nearly one million slaves were forcibly transported to the deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke many families of Upper South slaves, where planters were selling surplus slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816,The Southists imposed slave laws in the deep South and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817," From 1822, Mississippi slaves were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishments by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,"In most cases, the slave codes of the South made it illegal for a slave to be killed voluntarily."
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, in Mississippi 1860, Oliver v. State accused the accused of killing his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820," Mississippi became the twentieth state on December 10, 1817."
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes was its first governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as an ancestral land by several Amerindian tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823,"The plantations were developed mainly along the main rivers, where the seafront provided access to the main transport routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"It is also where the first cities develop, linked by steamboats that transported commercial products and crops to markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The rest of the Amerindian ancestral lands remained largely undeveloped, but were sold by treaty until 1826 when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826," Following the abolition of the Choctaw Tribal Government by the Mississippi State Legislative Assembly in 1829, the Indian Abduction Act of President Andrew Jackson and the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty of 1830, the Choctaws were effectively forced to sell their lands and were transported to Oklahoma territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, along with other southeastern tribes abducted as a result of the Act, has become known as the Tears Trail."
10828,23,mississippi,10828," When cotton was king in the 1850s, the owners of Mississippi plantations, especially those in the central Delta and black belt regions, became rich because of the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market and the free labour acquired through their African-American enslavement."
10829,23,mississippi,10829, They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830, Planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for work and serious wealth imbalances among whites have played an important role in state policy and in supporting planters for secession.
10831,23,mississippi,10831,The Mississippi was a slave society whose economy depended on slavery.
10832,23,mississippi,10832,The State was sparsely populated and the population was concentrated in riparian areas and towns.
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"In 1860, the enslaved Afro-American population numbered 436,631, representing 55 per cent of the total State population, or 791,305 persons."
10834,23,mississippi,10834," Less than 1,000 were people of free colour."
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively small population of the state prior to the civil war reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the river fronts, which formed the main transport corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836, Ninety per cent of the bottom land in the delta was still bordered and undeveloped.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The state needs many more settlers for development.
10838,23,mississippi,10838,Land farther from the rivers was cleared by liberated men and white migrants during reconstruction and later.
10839,23,mississippi,10839,"On January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union, and it was one of the founding members of the Confederate States."
10840,23,mississippi,10840,The first six states to separate were those with the largest number of slaves.
10841,23,mississippi,10841," During the war, the forces of the Union and the Confederates fought for their domination over the Mississippi, critical for supply routes and trade."
10842,23,mississippi,10842,"Over 80,000 Mississippians fought during the civil war, and the losses were extremely heavy."
10843,23,mississippi,10843,The long siege of Vicksburg of the General Union Ulysse S. Grant finally acquired control of the Union of the River in 1863.
10844,23,mississippi,10844,"In the postwar period, liberated men withdrew from white churches to create independent congregations."
10845,23,mississippi,10845,"The majority of Blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, reducing its membership considerably."
10846,23,mississippi,10846, They create independent Black Baptist congregations.
10847,23,mississippi,10847,In 1895 they established numerous associations of black Baptist states and the National Baptist Convention of Black Churches.
10848,23,mississippi,10848,"In addition, independent black denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church (established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 19th century) and the African Methodist Episcopal Church (established in New York), sent missionaries to the South in the post-war years."

10980,23,mississippi,10980,The African-American percentage of the population has begun to increase mainly because of a younger population than whites (the total fertility rates of both races are approximately equal).

11223,24,missouri,11223,"The state is named after the Missouri River, which was named after the Missouri Indians, a Siwan-speaking tribe."
11224,24,missouri,11224," They are said to have been called the Ouemessourita (wimihsoorita), which means ""those who have dug canoes"", by the speakers of the Miami-Illinois language."
11225,24,missouri,11225," This seems to be popular etymology – Illinois spoke an Algonquian language and the closest approximation that can be made in that of their close neighbours, the Ojibwe, is ""You should go down and visit these people."""
11226,24,missouri,11226," This would be a strange event, because the French who first explored and tried to settle in Mississippi generally obtained their translations during this fairly precise period, often giving things French names that were accurate translations of the native language(s)."
11227,24,missouri,11227," Assuming that the Missouri derives from the Siwan language, it translates as ""it connects to its side"", with reference to the river itself."
11228,24,missouri,11228,"It's not quite probable either, because it would be like ""Maya sunni"" (Mah-yah soo-nee)."
11229,24,missouri,11229," Most likely, however, the name Missouri comes from Chiwere, a Siwan language spoken by people who lived in the modern states of Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri and Nebraska."
11230,24,missouri,11230,"The name ""Missouri"" has several different pronunciations even among its natives of today, the two most common being (listening) miz-UR-ee and (listening) miz-UR-."
11231,24,missouri,11231," Other pronunciations also exist in Missouri or elsewhere in the United States, involving the realization of the medial consonant as either or ; the vowel in the second syllable as either or ; and the third syllable as (phonetically [i] (listening), [=] (listening) or [=] (listening) or."
11232,24,missouri,11232, Any combination of these phonetic achievements can be observed from the speakers of American English.
11233,24,missouri,11233,"In Great Britain, the preferred variant is miz-OR-ee, the OR-ee being a possible alternative."
11234,24,missouri,11234," Linguistic history was definitely dealt with by Donald M. Lance, who acknowledged that the issue was sociologically complex, but no pronunciation could be declared ""correct"", nor clearly defined as native or external, rural or urban, south or north, educated or not."
11235,24,missouri,11235," Politicians often use multiple pronunciations, even in a single speech, to appeal to more listeners."
11236,24,missouri,11236,"In informal contexts, the name of the state, for example ""Missour-ee"" or ""Missour-uh"", is sometimes used to phonetically distinguish pronunciations."
11237,24,missouri,11237, There's no official state nickname.
11238,24,missouri,11238," However, the unofficial nickname of Missouri is the ""Show Me State"", which appears on its license plates."
11239,24,missouri,11239, This formula has many origins.
11240,24,missouri,11240,"One of them is largely attributed to a speech by MP Willard Vandiver in 1899, who said that ""I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and democrats, and the sparkling eloquence does not convince me or satisfy me."
11241,24,missouri,11241,"I'm from Missouri, and you need to show me."
11242,24,missouri,11242," This is consistent with the saying ""I'm from Missouri,"" which means ""I'm skeptical about the issue and I'm not easily convinced of it."""
11243,24,missouri,11243," However, according to the researchers, the expression ""show me"" was already used before the 1890s."
11244,24,missouri,11244, Another indicates that this is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville (Colorado) to replace strikers.
11245,24,missouri,11245," Since the new men were not familiar with mining methods, they needed frequent education."
11246,24,missouri,11246," Other nicknames for Missouri include ""The Lead State"", ""The State of Bullion"", ""The State of Ozark"", ""The Mother of the West"", ""The State of the Iron Mountain"", and ""Western Pennsylvania""."
11247,24,missouri,11247,"It is also known as ""the state of the cellar"" because there are more than 7,300 caves registered in the State (second in Tennessee)."
11248,24,missouri,11248,Perry County is the county with the most caves and the longest.
11249,24,missouri,11249,"The official motto of the state is Latin: ""Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto"", which means ""Let the well-being of the people be the supreme law""."
11250,24,missouri,11250, Indigenous peoples lived in Missouri for thousands of years prior to European exploration and settlement.
11251,24,missouri,11251," Archaeological excavations along rivers have shown continuous habitat for more than 7,000 years."
11252,24,missouri,11252," From the year 1000 there was the complex culture of Mississippi, whose inhabitants created regional political centres at present, Saint-Louis, and on the other side of the Mississippi River, at Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois, today."
11253,24,missouri,11253, Their large cities have thousands of individual residences.
11254,24,missouri,11254," Yet, they are known for their massive mounds of earthmoving, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platform, peak of ridge and conical forms."
11255,24,missouri,11255,Cahokia was the centre of a regional trade network that extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
11256,24,missouri,11256," Civilization declined from 1400, and most descendants left the region long before the arrival of Europeans."
11257,24,missouri,11257,Saint-Louis was at a time known by American Europeans as Mound City because of the many prehistoric mounds that have survived since lost for urban development.
11258,24,missouri,11258," Mississippi culture left mounds in the mid-Missippi and Ohio valleys, extending into the southeast and upper rivers."
11259,24,missouri,11259,The land that became the state of Missouri was part of many different territories had changing and often undetermined boundaries and had many indigenous and European names between the 1600s and state status.
11260,24,missouri,11260,"For most of the first half of the 1700s, the western shore of Mississippi, which was to become Missouri, was essentially uninhabited, a land of no man who kept peace between Illinois on the east shore of Mississippi and north, and Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley."
11261,24,missouri,11261,"In the early 1700s, French merchants and missionaries explored the entire Mississippi Valley, known as the Louisiana area.At the same time, a different group of French Canadians who established five villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River placed their colonies in Illinois, Illinois."
11262,24,missouri,11262,"Genevieve, they continued to place their establishments in Illinois."
11263,24,missouri,11263,"At the same time, French colonies on both sides of Mississippi were part of the French province of Louisiana."
11264,24,missouri,11264,"To distinguish the colonies in the Middle Mississippi Valley from the French colonies in the Lower Mississippi Valley around New Orleans, French officials and residents called the Middle Mississippi Valley Upper Louisiana, Upper Louisiana, or Upper Louisiana."
11265,24,missouri,11265,"The first European settlers were mainly French Canadians, who created their first settlement in Missouri at the present time in Ste."
11266,24,missouri,11266,"Geneviève, about one hour south of Saint Louis."
11267,24,missouri,11267, They had migrated about 1750 from Illinois Country.
11268,24,missouri,11268," They came from colonial villages on the east side of the Mississippi River, where soils were becoming exhausted, and there was not enough seabed for the growing population."
11269,24,missouri,11269,"The early colonies of Missouri included many African and Amerindian slaves, and slave labor was at the heart of both commercial agriculture and the fur trade."
11270,24,missouri,11270,"Sainte-Geneviève has become a prosperous agricultural centre, producing enough wheat, corn and excess tobacco to ship tonnes of grain annually to Lower Louisiana for trade."
11271,24,missouri,11271, Grain production in Illinois was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.
11272,24,missouri,11272,Saint Louis was founded shortly afterwards by Pierre Laclède and the son-in-law Auguste Couteau of New Orleans in 1764.
11273,24,missouri,11273," From 1764 to 1803, European control of the region west of Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri basin, known as Louisiana, was assumed by the Spaniards as part of the vice-royalty of New Spain, because of the Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order for Spain to join France in the war against England)."
11274,24,missouri,11274,The arrival of the Spaniards in Saint Louis took place in September 1767.
11275,24,missouri,11275,"Saint-Louis became the centre of a regional fur trade with the Amerindian tribes that extended the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades."
11276,24,missouri,11276,The trading partners of the major companies shipped their furs from Saint-Louis through the river to New Orleans to export them to Europe.
11277,24,missouri,11277, They provided a variety of goods to dealers for sale and trade with their Amerindian customers.
11278,24,missouri,11278,The fur trade and associated companies have made St. Louis an early financial centre and have provided wealth for some to build fine houses and import luxury items.
11279,24,missouri,11279, Its location near Illinois's confluence meant that it also treated agricultural products.
11280,24,missouri,11280, Traffic and river trade along the Mississippi River are an integral part of the state economy.
11281,24,missouri,11281,"As the first major city in the region, Saint-Louis developed considerably after the invention of the steamboat and the growth of river trade."
11282,24,missouri,11282, Napoleon Bonaparte had acquired Louisiana for the French ownership of Spain in 1800 under the treaty of San Ildefonso after it had been a Spanish colony since 1762.
11283,24,missouri,11283,But the treaty was kept a secret.
11284,24,missouri,11284," Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until the transfer of power to France on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the transfer to the United States."
11285,24,missouri,11285,"Part of the purchase of Louisiana by the United States in 1803, the Missouri won the nickname ""Porte à l'Ouest"" because it served as an important starting point for expeditions and settlers heading west during the 19th century."
11286,24,missouri,11286,"Saint-Charles, just west of Saint-Louis, was the starting point and returning destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which climbed into Missouri in 1804, to explore the lands from the west to the Pacific Ocean."
11287,24,missouri,11287,Saint-Louis has been an important supply point for decades for settler parties heading west.
11288,24,missouri,11288,"As many early settlers from western Missouri emigrated from the Upper South, they brought Afro-American slaves as agricultural workers, and they wanted to continue their culture and the institution of slavery."
11289,24,missouri,11289," They settled mainly in 17 counties along the Missouri River, in an area of flat land that allowed plantation farming and became known as ""Little Dixie""."
11290,24,missouri,11290,The state was shaken by the earthquakes of 1811 to 1812.
11291,24,missouri,11291, There were few losses due to the small population.
11292,24,missouri,11292,"In 1821, the former Missouri territory was admitted as a slave state, under the compromise of Missouri and with a temporary state capital in Saint Charles."
11293,24,missouri,11293,"In 1826 the capital was moved to its current permanent location in Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River."
11294,24,missouri,11294," Originally, the western boundary of the state was a straight line, defined as the meridian passing through Kawsmouth, the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River."
11295,24,missouri,11295,The river has moved since this designation.
11296,24,missouri,11296, This line is known as Osage's border.
11297,24,missouri,11297,"In 1836 the purchase of the Platte was added to the northwest corner of the state after the purchase of the lands of the native tribes, making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River."
11298,24,missouri,11298," This addition increased the area of what was already the largest state of the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to the 65,000 square miles of Virginia, which then included Western Virginia)."
11299,24,missouri,11299,"In the early 1830s, Mormon migrants from the northern states and Canada began to settle near independence and areas just north of the island."
11300,24,missouri,11300," Conflicts over religion and slavery have arisen between the ""former settlers"" (mainly from the south) and the Mormons (mainly from the north)."
11301,24,missouri,11301,The Mormon War broke out in 1838.
11302,24,missouri,11302,"In 1839, with the help of a ""order of extermination"" from Governor Lilburn Boggs, the former settlers expelled the Mormons of Missouri and confiscated their lands."
11303,24,missouri,11303, Conflicts related to slavery exacerbated border tensions between States and territories.
11304,24,missouri,11304," From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with Iowa over the so-called Honey Lands gave rise to the call of militias from both states along the border."
11305,24,missouri,11305," With the increase in migration from 1830 to 1860, the Missouri population nearly doubled every decade."
11306,24,missouri,11306," Most of the newcomers were born in the United States, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s."
11307,24,missouri,11307," Since the majority were Catholics, they set up their own religious institutions in the state, most of which were Protestants."
11308,24,missouri,11308," Many settled in cities, creating a regional network and then a state of Catholic churches and schools."
11309,24,missouri,11309,19th-century German immigrants created the wine industry along Missouri and the beer industry in St. Louis.
11310,24,missouri,11310," While many German immigrants were strongly anti-slavery, many Irish immigrants living in cities were pro-slavery, fearing that the liberation of African-American slaves would create a mass of unskilled labour, leading to a drop in wages."
11311,24,missouri,11311, Most Missouri peasants were engaged in subsistence farming before the American Civil War.
11312,24,missouri,11312,The majority of those who were slaves had fewer than five persons each.
11313,24,missouri,11313," Planters, defined by some historians as holding some 20 or more slaves, were concentrated in the counties known as ""Little Dixie"" in the central part of the state along the Missouri River."
11314,24,missouri,11314,Tensions about slavery relate mainly to the future of the State and the nation.
11315,24,missouri,11315,"In 1860, African-American slaves accounted for less than 10% of the population of the state, or 1,182,012."
11316,24,missouri,11316,"To control the flooding of agricultural land and low-lying villages along Mississippi, the state completed the construction of 230 kilometres of dikes along the river in 1860."
11317,24,missouri,11317," After the secession of the southern states began in 1861, the parliament of Missouri called for the election of a special convention on secession."
11318,24,missouri,11318,Pro-South Governor Claiborne F. Jackson ordered the mobilization of hundreds of members of the state militia who had gathered in a Saint-Louis camp to train.
11319,24,missouri,11319," Alarmed by this action, the General Union Nathaniel Lyon strikes first, surrounds the camp and forces the troops of the state to surrender."
11320,24,missouri,11320,"Lyon directed its soldiers, mainly non-English-speaking German immigrants, to walk the prisoners in the streets, and they opened fire on the widely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them."
11321,24,missouri,11321," Soldiers killed unarmed prisoners, as well as men, women and children from Saint-Louis in the incident that became known as the ""Saint-Louis Massacre""."
11322,24,missouri,11322, These events have reinforced the confederate support within the state.
11323,24,missouri,11323," Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price, Speaker of the Secession Assembly, as head of the new Missouri State Guard."
11324,24,missouri,11324,"In the face of the rapid advance of the Lyon General Union across the state, Jackson and Price were forced to flee the capital of Jefferson City on June 14, 1861."
11325,24,missouri,11325,"In Neosho, Missouri, Jackson called the state legislature to ask for secession."
11326,24,missouri,11326," However, the elected legislative body has been divided between pro-Union and pro-Confederate."
11327,24,missouri,11327,"As such, few pro-unions attended the session called in Neosho, and the secession order was quickly passed."
11328,24,missouri,11328,"The Confederation recognized the secession of Missouri on October 30, 1861."

11652,25,montana,11652,"It is bordered by Idaho to the west, North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan to the north."
11653,25,montana,11653,"It is the fourth largest state by region, the eighth smallest populous state, and the third least dense densely populated state."
11654,25,montana,11654,"The western half of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges, while half is characterized by prairie terrain and western badlands, with more (although smaller) mountain ranges throughout the state."
11655,25,montana,11655,"In total, 77 named chains are part of the Rocky Mountains."
11656,25,montana,11656," Montana has no official nickname, but several unofficial names, including ""Big Sky Country"", ""The Treasure State"", ""Land of the Shining Mountains"", and ""The Last Best Place""."

11659,25,montana,11659,"The health, service and government sectors are also important to the government economy."
11660,25,montana,11660,"The fastest growing area in Montana is tourism, with nearly 13 million annual tourists visiting Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Beartooth Highway, Flathead Lake, Big Sky Resort and other attractions."
11661,25,montana,11661,"The name Montana comes from the Spanish word montaña, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, which means ""mountain"" or more widely ""mountainous country""."
11662,25,montana,11662,Montaña del Norte is the name given by the first Spanish explorers to the whole western mountainous region.
11663,25,montana,11663,The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill of the United States House Committee on Territories (then chaired by James Ashley of Ohio) for the territory that was to become the territory of Idaho.
11664,25,montana,11664,"The name was changed by representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained Montana had ""no sense""."
11665,25,montana,11665," When Ashley introduced a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be dug out of Idaho, he again chose Montana's territory."
11666,25,montana,11666," This time, Rep. Samuel Cox, also from Ohio, objected to the name."
11667,25,montana,11667,Cox complained that the name was a bad name given most of the territory was not mountainous and a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish name.
11668,25,montana,11668," Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but the Territorial Committee decided that they could appoint him as they wished, so that the original name of Montana had been adopted."
11669,25,montana,11669," Montana is one of eight mountain states, located north of the region known as the western United States."
11670,25,montana,11670,It is bordered by North Dakota and South Dakota to the east.

11675,25,montana,11675," Most of the hundreds or more of Montana's mountain ranges are in the western half of the state, most of which are geologically and geographically part of the northern Rocky Mountains."
11676,25,montana,11676,The Absaroka and Beartooth chains in the south-central part of the State are technically part of the Central Rockies.
11677,25,montana,11677,The Rocky Mountain Front is an important feature of the north-central part of the state and the expanses of isolated islands that interrupt the common prairie landscape in the central and eastern parts of the state.
11678,25,montana,11678," About 60 per cent of the state is a prairie, which is part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains, one of the longest continuous expanses of the Alaskan Rocky Mountains in Mexico, as well as smaller expanses, including the Alene Heart Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the Idaho State."

11682,25,montana,11682,"The northern section of the fracture, where the mountains quickly give way to the prairies, is part of the Rocky Mountain Front."
11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is most prominent in the Lewis range, located primarily in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684," Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (starting on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska) crosses this area and turns east at Montana at Triple Divide Peak."
11685,25,montana,11685,"It causes the Waterton, Belly and Saint Mary rivers to flow north, Alberta, Canada."

11698,25,montana,11698," Known as laccoliths, they formed when the igneous rock crossed cracks in the sedimentary rock."
11699,25,montana,11699,The underlying surface is sandstone and shale.
11700,25,montana,11700,"The area's surface soils are very diverse and strongly affected by local geology, whether they are glazed plains, inter-mountain basins, mountain foothills or plateaus."
11701,25,montana,11701,"The regions of the foothills are often covered with broken stones or slates or bare rocks discovered (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil of the intermountainous basins is generally composed of clay, gravel, sand, silt and volcanic ash, most of which consists of lakes that covered the region during the oligocene 33-23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"The plateaus are often surmounted by argillite gravel and worn quartzite, sometimes submerged with shale."
11704,25,montana,11704,"The glaciated plains are generally covered with clay, gravel, sand and silt left by the Great Falls Proglacial Lake or by moraines or ancient gravel-covered lake basins left by the glaciation of Wisconsin 85,000 to 11,000 years ago."

11770,25,montana,11770," Continental division has a considerable effect on climate, as it limits the warmer air flow in the Pacific from the east and the drier continental air from the west."
11771,25,montana,11771,"The region west of the fracture has a modified climate on the Pacific North Coast, with milder winters, colder summers, less wind and a longer growing season."
11772,25,montana,11772," Low clouds and fog often form in valleys west of the fracture in winter, but this is rarely seen to the east."
11773,25,montana,11773, Average daily temperatures range from 28°F or -2.2°C in January to 84.5°F or 29.2°C in July.
11774,25,montana,11774,Variation in geography results in large temperature variations.

11782,25,montana,11782, Cold winter spells are usually the result of cold continental air coming from southern Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The forehead is often well defined, causing a sharp drop in temperature within 24 hours."
11784,25,montana,11784," Conversely, the southwestern airflow translates into ""chinooks."""
11785,25,montana,11785," These steady winds from 25 to 50 mph (40 to 80 km/h) (or more) can suddenly warm up parts of Montana, especially areas just east of the mountains, where temperatures can sometimes reach 50 to 60 degrees F (10 to 15.6 degrees Celsius) for 10 days or more."
11786,25,montana,11786,Loma is the site of the most extreme temperature change recorded over a 24-hour period in the United States.
11787,25,montana,11787,"On 15 January 1972, a chinook wind blows and the temperature increases from -54°F to 49°F (−47.8°C to 9.4°C)."
11788,25,montana,11788, Average annual precipitation is 380 mm but large variations are observed.
11789,25,montana,11789,"The mountain ranges block the damp air of the Pacific, holding moisture in the western valleys, and creating rain shadows in the east."
11790,25,montana,11790,"Heron, in the west, receives the most rainfall, 34.70 inches (881 mm)."
11791,25,montana,11791,"On the eastern side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine measures an average of 11.45 inches (291 mm) and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation."
11792,25,montana,11792,"The mountains can receive more than 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the Glacier Glacier Glacier Glacier Glacier receives 105 inches (2700 mm)."

11799,25,montana,11799," Many cities in Montana recorded record heat in July 2007, the warmest month ever recorded in Montana."
11800,25,montana,11800,"Winters are also warmer, and have fewer cold spells."
11801,25,montana,11801," Previously, these cold spells had killed bark beetles, but they now attack forests in western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the area allowed various species to expand their range and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, beetle attack and poor management resulted in a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804," According to a study by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some parts of Montana will experience a 200 per cent increase in the area burned by forest fires and an 80 per cent increase in air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below shows average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month of the seven largest cities in Montana.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on the location, although the numbers are similar throughout."
11807,25,montana,11807, Montana is one of only two contiguous states (with Colorado) that are antipodal to land.

11809,25,montana,11809,"No city is exactly antipodal in Kerguelen, even though Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples lived in the territory of the present state of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811," Historical tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers in the United States included the Crow in south-central, Cheyenne in the very southeast, Blackfeet, Assiniboine and Gros Ventres in central and north-central, and Kootenai and Salish in the west."

11815,25,montana,11815," After and especially in the decades after the Lewis and Clark expeditions, American, British and French traders operated a fur trade, usually working with Aboriginal peoples, in the eastern and western parts of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816," These transactions have not always been peaceful, and although the fur trade has brought material gain to indigenous tribal groups, it has also highlighted European diseases and altered their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The Fort Raymond trading post (1807–11) was built in Crow Indian Country in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818," Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), lands to the west of the continental division were disputed between the British and the United States and were known as Oregon countries."
11819,25,montana,11819,The first permanent establishment by the Euro-Americans in what is today Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near Stevensville today.

11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state from 1862 onward found gold, silver, copper, lead and coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the region."

11834,25,montana,11834,"The Montana Historical Society, founded February 2, 1865 in Virginia City, is the oldest such institution to the west of Mississippi (excluding Louisiana)."
11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870, respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and Washburn–Langford–Doane expeditions were launched from Helen into the Upper Yellowstone area and led directly to the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As settlers began to populate Montana from the 1850s to the 1870s, disputes ensued with the Amerindians, mainly over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, the territorial governor of Washington, Isaac Stevens, negotiated the Hellgate Treaty between the United States government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai of western Montana, which established the boundaries of tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838,The treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839," While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reserve, the difficulty with the interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led Whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was open to colonization, but tribal nations challenged these provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first U.S. Army post in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect the traffic of steamboats going to Fort Benton."

11846,25,montana,11846,The last conflict in Montana between the U.S. Army and the Amerindians took place in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in Big Horn's country.
11847,25,montana,11847,Indian survivors who have signed treaties are generally required to enter reserves.
11848,25,montana,11848,"In parallel to these conflicts, bison, a key species of stone, and the main source of proteins on which Aboriginal people had survived for centuries, were destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849, Some estimates suggest that more than 13 million bison were found in Montana in 1870.

11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle farming has been at the heart of Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and exchanged fattened cattle in fertile valleys of Montana with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.

11857,25,montana,11857,The tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad (NPR) reached Montana from west in 1881 and east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858," However, in the 1870s, the railway played a leading role in tensions with the Amerindian tribes."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, president of the NPR, launched major surveys in the Yellowstone Valley in 1871, 1872 and 1873, which were violently contested by the Sioux under Chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860," These clashes contributed in part to the panic of 1873, a financial crisis which delayed the construction of the railway in Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"The surveys carried out in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped trigger the Great Sioux War of 1876."

11863,25,montana,11863,"The Great Northern Railroad (GNR) tracks reached eastern Montana in 1887, and when they reached northern Rocky Mountains in 1890, the GNR became a major tourism promoter in the Glacier National Park area."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893, in Scenic, Washington."

11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress only approved state status in Montana in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting state status in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington after the appropriate constitutions had been drafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,In July 1889 the Montaneans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government.

11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land for settlers who could claim and ""proven"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875, Montana did not see a significant influx of immigrants under this Act because 160 acres were generally insufficient to support a family in arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,"In 1868, David Carpenter, near Helen, made the first claim of ownership under the act in Montana."
11877,25,montana,11877,"The first claim of a woman was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana's pioneer, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"In 1880, farms were located in the greenest valleys of central and western Montana, but few were in the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Lands Act of 1877 was passed to permit the establishment of dry lands in the west and allocated 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a $25 per acre right and a promise of irrigation of the land.
11880,25,montana,11880," After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would belong to the settler."
11881,25,montana,11881," This law brought most cattle and sheep breeders to Montana, many of whom have pricked their herds in the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land, and then abandoned it without paying the final costs."
11882,25,montana,11882," Some farmers arrived with the arrival of the Northern and Northern Pacific Great Railways during the 1880s and 1890s, but in relatively small numbers."

11884,25,montana,11884, Other railroads followed.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the Rehabilitation Act was passed, which allowed for the construction of irrigation projects in the eastern river valleys of Montana."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909, Congress passed the Extended Houses Act, which extended the area of open land from 160 acres to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family, and in 1912 reduced the time to ""proven"" to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Homesteads Act allowed 640 acres of homesteads in areas unsuitable for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888," This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of landowners, attracted to free land, with World War I bringing particularly high prices of wheat."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana is going through a temporary period of higher than average precipitation."
11890,25,montana,11890," Owners arriving in this period were called ""Honyockers"", or ""scissors""."
11891,25,montana,11891," Although the word ""honyocker"", perhaps derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisory manner to the owners as ""green horns"", ""new in their business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had agricultural experience, although many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892," However, farmers have had to deal with a number of problems."
11893,25,montana,11893, Massive debt was one.
11894,25,montana,11894,"In addition, most settlers came from wetter areas, were not prepared for dry climate, lack of trees and limited water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small houses less than 320 acres (130 ha) were not suitable for the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896, Weather and agricultural conditions are much harsher and drier to the west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897, Then the drought of 1917-1921 proved devastating.
11898,25,montana,11898," Many people left, and half of the state banks went bankrupt by providing mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, the size of farms has increased while the number of farms has decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"In 1910, the owners filed claims on more than five million acres and in 1923, more than 93 million acres were cultivated."
11901,25,montana,11901,"In 1910, the Great Falls Land Office alone had more than a thousand property deposits per month, and at the peak of 1917-1918, it had 14,000 each year."
11902,25,montana,11902, Significant declines occurred following the 1919 drought.

11904,25,montana,11904," His actions were widely criticized in Montana, where support for war and patriotism was strong."
11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917-1918, due to a miscalculation of the population of Montana, approximately 40,000 Montanans, 10 per cent of the population of the State, volunteered or were recruited into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906, This represented a workforce contribution to the war that was 25 per cent higher than any other per capita state.
11907,25,montana,11907," Approximately 1500 Montanans died as a result of the war and 2437 were injured, also more than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908," Montana Remount Station in Miles City provided 10,000 horse cavalry horses for the war, more than any other army post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for the interests of mining, lumber and agriculture in Montana, as the demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the American Congress adopted the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the 1918 Sedition Act."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Parliament of Montana passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912," Together, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, army or symbols by speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana Act led to the arrest of more than 200 persons and the conviction of 78 persons, mainly of German or Austrian origin."
11914,25,montana,11914,Over 40 people spent time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, Governor Brian Schweitzer granted full posthumous pardons to all those found guilty of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed the entry of the United States into the war included groups of immigrants of German and Irish origin, as well as pacifist anabaptists such as the Hutterites and Mennonites, many of whom were also of Germanic origin."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-war groups such as the Montana Council of Defense, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and local loyalty committees, were formed."
11918,25,montana,11918,The sense of war was complicated by labour problems.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The Anaconda Copper Company, which was at its historic peak in copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and trade unions that struggle to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multi-ethnic community of major European immigrants, trade unions, in particular the new Metal Mining Workers' Union, were opposed to the war on the grounds that they mostly benefited from major interests in the softwood lumber and mining sector."
11921,25,montana,11921," Following the explosion of mining production and the disaster of the speculator mine in June 1917, Frank Little, world organizer of industrial workers, arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave a few speeches with an incendiary rhetoric against the war.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On 1 August 1917, he was dragged from his boarding school by masked vigilantes, and hanged on a railway lattice, considered to be a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,The murder of Little and the ensuing strikes led the National Guard to be sent to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925," Overall, anti-German and anti-laborator sentiment has increased and created a movement that led to the adoption of the Montana Sedition Act the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Defence Council had been established as a State body empowered to prosecute and punish persons tried in violation of the law."
11927,25,montana,11927,The Council also adopted rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting the use of German in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"As a result of the legislative action of 1918, emotions increased."
11929,25,montana,11929,U.S. prosecutor Burton K. Wheeler and several district court judges who have hesitated to prosecute or convict accused persons have been strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930," Wheeler was presented to the Defence Council, although he avoided formal proceedings, and a judge of the Forsyth District Court was indicted."
11931,25,montana,11931, There were book burns in German and several near-hangings.
11932,25,montana,11932,The ban on German speaking remains in force in the early 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Complemented with wartime struggles, the 1918 influenza epidemic claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanians."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that occurred has led some historians to duplicate this period ""the agony of Montana""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after the First World War and lasted during the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936," This has caused many difficulties for farmers, herders and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937," Wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state an important producer; wheat has a relatively high protein content, which requires high prices."
11938,25,montana,11938,"At the time of the United States' entry into the Second World War on December 8, 1941, many Montanas had enlisted in the army to escape the bad national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Over 40,000 Montanians entered the armed forces in the first year after the declaration of war, and more than 57,000 joined before the end of the war."
11940,25,montana,11940," These figures represented about ten per cent of the population of the state, and Montana again provided one of the highest per capita numbers of soldiers in any state."
11941,25,montana,11941," Many Amerindians were among those who served, including the Crow Nation soldiers who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,At least 1500 Montanans died in the war.
11943,25,montana,11943," Montana was also the training ground of the First Special Service Force or ""Devil's Brigade"", an American commando-style joint force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for the mountain and winter conditions prior to deployment."
11944,25,montana,11944,"Air bases have been built in Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank and Glasgow, some of which have served as assembly areas to prepare aircraft for Soviet Union allied forces."
11945,25,montana,11945," During the war, about 30 Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs landed in Montana, although no casualties or major forest fires were attributed to them."
11946,25,montana,11946,"In 1940, Jeannette Rankin was again elected to Congress."
11947,25,montana,11947,"In 1941, as it had done in 1917, she voted against the United States declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
11948,25,montana,11948," His vote was the only one against the war, and following a public outcry about his vote, Rankin needed police protection for a while."
11949,25,montana,11949," Other pacifists tended to be those of the ""peace churches"" that were generally opposed to war."
11950,25,montana,11950, Many people claiming U.S. conscientious objector status were sent to Montana during the war as smoke jumpers and for other tasks of fighting forest fires.
11951,25,montana,11951,"In 1942, the U.S. Army established camp Rimini near Helen to train sled dogs in winter weather."
11952,25,montana,11952," During the Second World War, the planned USMontana combat vessel was appointed in honour of the State, but it was never completed."
11953,25,montana,11953, Montana is the only one of the first 48 states that do not have a complete warship to be appointed in its favour.
11954,25,montana,11954, Alaska and Hawaii both had nuclear submarines bearing their names.
11955,25,montana,11955, Montana is the only State of the Union without a modern naval ship named in its honour.
11956,25,montana,11956," However, in August 2007, Senator Jon Tester asked for a submarine to be named U.S. Montana."
11957,25,montana,11957," Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced on September 3, 2015 that the Virginia-class SSN-794 submarine will become the second warship ordered to bear this name."
11958,25,montana,11958," After World War II, Montana became host to the US Air Force Military Air Transport Service (1947) for airlift training in the C-54 Skymasters and, finally, in 1953, the Air Force and the Strategic Air Command's anti-missile forces were based at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls."
11959,25,montana,11959,"The base also hosted 29 Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Air Defence Command, from 1953 to 1968."
11960,25,montana,11960,"In December 1959, the Malmstrom AFB was chosen to house the new Minuteman I intercontinental ballistic missile."

12597,27,nevada,12597," Eight days before the presidential election of 1864, Nevada became the 36th state of the Union, despite the absence of the minimum required of 60,000 inhabitants to become a state."
12598,27,nevada,12598,"(At the time, Nevada's population was just over 10,000.)"
12599,27,nevada,12599," Instead of sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27 – the most expensive telegraph on file at the time for a single shipment."
12600,27,nevada,12600," Finally, Washington's response came on October 31, 1864: ""The pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day has been admitted into the Union""."
12601,27,nevada,12601,"The state was rushed on 31 October to help secure the re-election of Abraham Lincoln on 8 November and Republican domination after the civil war in Congress, while the Nevada mining economy linked him to the more industrialized Union."
12602,27,nevada,12602,"As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the election manually and don't need Nevada's help."
12603,27,nevada,12603, Nevada is one of the only two states to significantly expand its borders after its entry into the Union.
12604,27,nevada,12604,"(The other was Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the purchase of platters.)"
12605,27,nevada,12605,"In 1866, another part of the western Utah territory was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state, setting the present eastern boundary."
12606,27,nevada,12606," Nevada reached its present southern boundaries on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the part of Pah-Ute County in Arizona territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of the present Nevada south of the 37th parallel."
12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was caused by the discovery of gold in the region, and officials thought that Nevada would be better able to oversee the projected population boom."
12608,27,nevada,12608, This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area.
12609,27,nevada,12609, Mining has shaped the Nevada economy for many years (see Silver mining in Nevada).
12610,27,nevada,12610," When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It, mining had led to an industry of speculation and vast wealth."
12611,27,nevada,12611, Mining and population decreased temporarily at the end of the 19th century.
12612,27,nevada,12612," However, the rich silver strike at Tonopah in 1900, followed by strikes at Goldfield and Rhyolite, created a second mining boom in Nevada and the population of Nevada."
12613,27,nevada,12613,"Unregulated gambling was commonplace in the early mining towns of Nevada, but it was banned in 1909 as part of a national anti-gambling crusade."
12614,27,nevada,12614,"As a result of the subsequent declines in mining production and the decline in the agricultural sector during the Great Depression, Nevada again legalized the game on March 19, 1931, with the approval of the Legislative Assembly."
12615,27,nevada,12615,The signature of Governor Fred B. Balzar promulgated the country's most liberal laws on divorce and open play.
12616,27,nevada,12616,The reforms came just eight days after the federal government introduced the $49 million construction contract for the Boulder Dam (now the Hoover Dam).
12617,27,nevada,12617,"The Nevada Test Site, located 105 kilometres northwest of Las Vegas, was established on January 11, 1951 for nuclear weapons testing."
12618,27,nevada,12618,"The site consists of approximately 1,350 square miles (3,500 km2) of the desert and mountainous terrain."
12619,27,nevada,12619," Nuclear tests at the Nevada test site began with a 1 kiloton TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb launched on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951."
12620,27,nevada,12620,The last atmospheric test was carried out on 17 July 1962 and underground weapons tests continued until 23 September 1992.
12621,27,nevada,12621,The location is known to have the highest concentration of detonated nuclear weapons in the United States
12622,27,nevada,12622,More than 80 per cent of the territory of the state is owned by the federal government.
12623,27,nevada,12623,The main reason for this is that homesteads have not been allowed in sufficient size to be viable in the arid conditions prevailing throughout the Nevada desert.
12624,27,nevada,12624," Instead, the first settlers resided in land surrounding a water source and then grazed livestock on adjacent public lands, which is unnecessary for agriculture without access to water (this farming pattern still prevails)."
12625,27,nevada,12625,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Nevada population as of July 1, 2019 was 3,080,156, an increase of 45,764 (1.51%) since the 2018 U.S. Census estimate and an increase of 379,605 (14.06 per cent) since the 2010 U.S. Census."
12626,27,nevada,12626, Nevada experienced the highest population growth between 2017 and 2018.
12627,27,nevada,12627,"As of the 2010 census, 6.9 per cent of the population of the State was under 5 years of age, 24.6 per cent under 18 years of age and 12.0 per cent 65 years of age and over."
12628,27,nevada,12628,Women make up about 49.5% of the population.
12629,27,nevada,12629," Since the 2010 census, the population of Nevada has experienced a natural increase of 87,581 people (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 people (of whom 104,032 are due to domestic migration and 42,594 due to international migration)."
12630,27,nevada,12630,The Nevada Population Centre is located in southern Nye County.
12631,27,nevada,12631,"In this county, the unincorporated city of Pahrump, 97 km west of Las Vegas on the California state line, grew very rapidly from 1980 to 2010."
12632,27,nevada,12632,"As of the 2010 census, it had 36,441 inhabitants."
12633,27,nevada,12633," Las Vegas grew from a mulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1970 and was the fastest growing city and metropolitan area in America from 1960 to 2000."
12634,27,nevada,12634," From the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the United States."
12635,27,nevada,12635," Between 1990 and 2000, the population of Nevada increased by 66 per cent, while the population of the country increased by 13 per cent."
12636,27,nevada,12636,"Over two-thirds of the population lives in Clark County, which is co-extensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12637,27,nevada,12637," Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the country's most centralized states."
12638,27,nevada,12638,"Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the fastest growing 20 cities in the United States with over 100,000 inhabitants."
12639,27,nevada,12639,The rural community of Mesquite 105 kilometres northeast of Las Vegas was an example of micropolitan growth in the 1990s and 2000.
12640,27,nevada,12640, Other desert cities such as Indian Springs and Searchlight on the outskirts of Las Vegas have also seen some growth.
12641,27,nevada,12641," Since 1950, the Nevada-born population rate has never exceeded 27 per cent, the lowest in all states."
12642,27,nevada,12642,"In 2012, only 25% of Nevadas were born in the state."
12643,27,nevada,12643," Most of the new residents of Nevada have moved from California, which has led some Nevadas to feel that their condition is ""California""."
12644,27,nevada,12644," According to the 2017 American Community Survey, 28.2% of the population of Nevada were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (21.4%), Puerto Rican (0.9%), Cuban (1.0%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (4.8%)."
12645,27,nevada,12645,"The five largest groups of non-Hispanic white descent were German (11.3%), Irish (9.0%), English (6.9%), Italian (5.8%) and American (4.7%)."
12646,27,nevada,12646,"In 1980, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 83.3% of the population of the state."
12647,27,nevada,12647,"In 2011, 63.6 per cent of the population of Nevada, under one year of age, were minorities."
12648,27,nevada,12648, Las Vegas is a majority-majority minority city.
12649,27,nevada,12649," According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 1 July 2018, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 48.7% of Nevada's population."
12650,27,nevada,12650,"In the counties of Douglas, Mineral and Pershing, a plurality of residents are of Mexican ancestry."
12651,27,nevada,12651,"In Nye County and Humboldt County, residents are mainly of German ancestry; Washoe County has many Irish Americans."
12652,27,nevada,12652,"British Americans form a plurality in Lincoln County, Churchill County, Lyon County, White Pine County and Eureka County."
12653,27,nevada,12653, Asian Americans had been living in the state since the California Gold Rush of the 1850s brought thousands of Chinese miners to Washoe County.
12654,27,nevada,12654, They were followed by a few hundred Japanese agricultural workers in the late 19th century.
12655,27,nevada,12655,"By the end of the 20th century, many immigrants from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India and Vietnam arrived in the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12656,27,nevada,12656,"The city now has one of America's most prolific Asian communities, with a predominantly Chinese and Taiwanese region known as ""Chinatown"" west of I-15 on Spring Mountain Road."
12657,27,nevada,12657,"The American Filipinos are the largest American Asian group in the state, with a population of over 113,000."
12658,27,nevada,12658, They make up 56.5 per cent of the Asian population of Nevada and about 4.3 per cent of the population of the State as a whole.
12659,27,nevada,12659,The mining booms attract many Greek and Eastern European immigrants to Nevada.
12660,27,nevada,12660,"The indigenous tribes of Nevada are Koso, Paiute, Panamint, Shoshoni, Walapi, Washoe and Ute tribes."
12661,27,nevada,12661,"The main countries of origin of Nevada immigrants were Mexico (39.5 per cent of immigrants), the Philippines (14.3 per cent), El Salvador (5.2 per cent), China (3.1 per cent) and Cuba (3 per cent)."
12662,27,nevada,12662,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, as Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, resulting in a higher overall number."
12663,27,nevada,12663,A small percentage of Nevada's population lives in rural areas.
12664,27,nevada,12664,The culture of these places differs significantly from the major metropolitan areas.
12665,27,nevada,12665,"The inhabitants of these rural counties tend to be residents of Nevada, unlike the Las Vegas and Reno regions, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state."
12666,27,nevada,12666,The rural population is also less diverse from the point of view of race and ethnic origin.
12667,27,nevada,12667,"The mining industry plays an important role in the economy of rural counties, with tourism being less important."
12668,27,nevada,12668,Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada.
12669,27,nevada,12669,The attendance of the Church in Nevada is one of the weakest of all American states.
12670,27,nevada,12670,"In a 2009 Gallup poll, only 30% of Nevadas reported that they attended church every week or almost, compared to 42% of all Americans (it was found that only four states had a lower attendance rate than Nevada)."
12671,27,nevada,12671,"The main religious affiliations of the Nevada population are: Protestants 35%, no religion 28%, Roman Catholics 25%, Saint of the last days 4%, Jews 2%, Hindus less than 1%, Buddhists 0.5% and Islamics less than 0.1%."

12675,27,nevada,12675," Nevada's economy is linked to tourism (particularly entertainment and gambling), mining and livestock farming."
12676,27,nevada,12676," Nevada's industrial products are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing and electrical equipment."
12677,27,nevada,12677,The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Nevada's total revenue in 2018 was $170 billion.
12678,27,nevada,12678,"The per capita personal income of the government in 2018 was $43,820, ranking 35th in the nation."
12679,27,nevada,12679," Nevada's 2012 public debt was calculated as $7.5 billion, or $3,100 per taxpayer."
12680,27,nevada,12680,"As of December 2014, the state unemployment rate was 6.8%."
12681,27,nevada,12681,The Nevada economy has long been linked to vice-industries.
12682,27,nevada,12682,"""Nevada was] based on mining and re-founded on sin – starting with the fight against prices and easy divorce a century ago, then extending to gambling and prostitution,"" said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist."
12683,27,nevada,12683,"In some parts of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas, mining plays a major economic role."
12684,27,nevada,12684,"In value, gold is by far the most important mineral mine extracted."
12685,27,nevada,12685,"In 2004, 6,800,000 ounces (1900,000,000 g) of gold worth $2.84 billion were mined in Nevada, and the state accounted for 8.7% of world gold production (see Nevada gold mining)."
12686,27,nevada,12686,"Silver is a second distant, with 10,300,000 ounces (290,000 g) worth $69 million extracted in 2004 (see Silver mining in Nevada)."
12687,27,nevada,12687," Other minerals used in Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite and lithium."
12688,27,nevada,12688," Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high and production is very sensitive to world commodity prices."
12689,27,nevada,12689,Cattle breeding is a major economic activity in rural Nevada.
12690,27,nevada,12690," Nevada's agricultural outputs are cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions and potatoes."
12691,27,nevada,12691,"As of 1 January 2006, there were about 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada."
12692,27,nevada,12692," Most of these animals feed in summer on the routes, with additional food in winter."
12693,27,nevada,12693,Calfs are usually shipped to out-of-state feedlots in the fall to be fattened for the market.
12694,27,nevada,12694,"More than 90% of Nevada's 484,000 acres (196,000 ha) of cultivated land are used to grow hay, especially alfalfa, for livestock feed."
12695,27,nevada,12695,"The largest employers in the State, in the first quarter of 2011, are the following, according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation:"
12696,27,nevada,12696,"Amtrak's California Zephyr train uses the original Union Pacific transcontinental railway line in daily service from Chicago to Emeryville, California, serving Elko, Winnemucca and Reno."
12697,27,nevada,12697, Las Vegas has not had a passenger train service since the Amtrak Desert Wind was abandoned in 1997.
12698,27,nevada,12698,"Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provides a connecting service between Las Vegas and the trains in Needles, California, Los Angeles and Bakersfield, California; and Stateline, Nevada, in Sacramento, California."
12699,27,nevada,12699,A number of proposals were made to reintroduce service in Los Angeles or Southern California.
12700,27,nevada,12700,The Union Pacific Railroad has railways north and south of Nevada.
12701,27,nevada,12701,Greyhound Lines provides a bus service in the state.
12702,27,nevada,12702,Interstate 15 (I-15) crosses the southern extremity of the state and serves Las Vegas and other communities.
12703,27,nevada,12703,The I-215 and I-515 also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12704,27,nevada,12704,"I-80 crosses the northern part of Nevada, following roughly the Humboldt River trail from Utah to the east and Truckee River to the west via Reno in California."
12705,27,nevada,12705,"She has a spur road, I-580."
12706,27,nevada,12706," Nevada is also served by several U.S. routes: U.S. 6, U.S. 50, U.S. 93, U.S. 95 and U.S. 395."
12707,27,nevada,12707, There are also 189 roads in Nevada.
12708,27,nevada,12708," Many counties of Nevada also have a network of county roads, although many are not signed or paved in rural areas."
12709,27,nevada,12709, Nevada is one of the few U.S. states that do not have a continuous interstate highway linking its two major population centres – the road link between the Las Vegas and Reno regions is a combination of several different interstate and American highways.
12710,27,nevada,12710,The routing proposed by Interstate 11 could possibly remedy this situation.
12711,27,nevada,12711,"The state is one of the few in the country to allow semi-trailers with three trailers – a so-called ""road train"" in Australia."
12712,27,nevada,12712,"But the American versions are usually smaller, partly because they have to climb and descend rather steep mountain passes."
12713,27,nevada,12713,RTC Transit is the transit system of the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12714,27,nevada,12714,"The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a network of bus services across the Las Vegas Valley, including the use of The Deuce, a two-storey bus, on the Las Vegas Band and several outlying roads."
12715,27,nevada,12715,RTC RIDE operates a local transport bus service system throughout the metropolitan area of Reno-Sparks.

12717,27,nevada,12717, Most other counties in the state do not have public transport at all.
12718,27,nevada,12718,"In addition, a 4 mile (6.4 km) monorail system provides public transportation in the Las Vegas area."
12719,27,nevada,12719,"The Las Vegas Monorail Line serves several casinos and the Las Vegas Convention Centre, east of the Las Vegas Strip, near Paradise Road, with a possible extension to McCarran International Airport."
12720,27,nevada,12720," Several hotels also operate their own monorail lines between them, which are usually several blocks in length."
12721,27,nevada,12721,The McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is the busiest airport serving Nevada.
12722,27,nevada,12722,Reno-Tahoe International Airport (formerly known as Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the state.
12723,27,nevada,12723, Nevada has a flourishing solar energy sector.
12724,27,nevada,12724,An independent study conducted in 2013 found that solar energy users created a net benefit of $36 million.
12725,27,nevada,12725," However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission allowed the State's only electricity company, NV Energy, to charge higher tariffs and charges to solar panel users, resulting in the immediate collapse of the use of solar panels on the roof."
12726,27,nevada,12726,"In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository as the only site that is considered a permanent repository for all highly radioactive waste in the country."
12727,27,nevada,12727," Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Government of Nevada are divided into three separate departments: the Executive, composed of the Governor of Nevada and his cabinet, as well as other elected members of the Constitution; the Legislative, composed of the Legislative Assembly of Nevada and the Senate; and the Judicial, composed of the Supreme Court of Nevada and lower courts."
12728,27,nevada,12728,"The Governor is the Chief Justice of Nevada, the Head of the Executive Department of the Government of the State and the Commander-in-Chief of the State Military Forces."
12729,27,nevada,12729,"The present governor is Steve Sisolak, Democrat."
12730,27,nevada,12730,The Nevada Legislature is a bicameral body divided into an Assembly and a Senator.
12731,27,nevada,12731, Members of the Assembly sit for two years and senators sit for four years.
12732,27,nevada,12732,"The two Houses of the Nevada Legislative Assembly will be affected by the terms of office from 2010, since senators and MPs/women will be limited to a maximum of 12 years in each chamber (by appointment or election that is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the Constitution that has recently been confirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court in a unanimous decision."
12733,27,nevada,12733," Each session of Parliament meets for a constitutional term of 120 days per odd year, or more if the governor calls for an extraordinary session."
12734,27,nevada,12734,"On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a women's majority in its legislature."
12735,27,nevada,12735,"Women occupy nine of the 21 seats of the Senator of Nevada, and 23 of the 42 seats in the Nevada Assembly."
12736,27,nevada,12736,The Supreme Court of Nevada is the Supreme Court of the State and the head of the judiciary of Nevada.
12737,27,nevada,12737, Initial jurisdiction is divided between district courts (with general jurisdiction) and courts and municipal courts (both of limited jurisdiction).
12738,27,nevada,12738," Appeals from district courts are addressed directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which, as part of a model derogatory jurisdiction, has the discretion to refer cases to the Court of Appeal for final adjudication."
12739,27,nevada,12739," Cities incorporated in Nevada, known as cities, are empowered to legislate on anything not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to allow the local government to integrate the cities of Nevada in order to give them more flexibility and less restrictions on the part of the Legislative Assembly.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"The municipal councils of unincorporated cities are limited local governments created either by the local county commission or by referendum, and play a purely consultative role and do not in any way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"In 1900, Nevada's population was the smallest of all states and decreased, as the difficulties of living in a ""wild desert"" began to prevail over the lure of money for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743,The historian Lawrence Friedman explains what happened next:
12744,27,nevada,12744," With the advent of air conditioning for the summer and the mild winters of South Nevada, the state's fortunes began to revolve around, as for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growth in the Union."
12745,27,nevada,12745, Nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal – in an approved brothel in a county that has expressly voted to allow it.
12746,27,nevada,12746,"It is illegal in large jurisdictions such as Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), Washoe County (which contains Reno), and the independent city of Carson City."
12747,27,nevada,12747," Nevada's first reputation as a ""divorce haven"" came from the fact that before the revolution of no-fault divorce in the 1970s, divorces were difficult to obtain in the United States."
12748,27,nevada,12748," Having already legalized gambling and prostitution, Nevada continued to strengthen its profile by adopting one of the country's most liberal divorce laws."

13612,29,new_jersey,13612,"The Act offers many choices to communities that prefer strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and provides great flexibility to allow municipalities to choose the characteristics of their government: the number of seats on the council; the seats chosen in general, by neighbourhoods or by combination of the two; staggered or concurrent mandates; and a mayor chosen by the council or directly elected by the voters."

14113,31,new_york,14113," Between 1640 and 1680, the Iroquoian peoples conducted campaigns ranging from modern Michigan to Virginia against the Algonquian and Siwan tribes, as well as between them."
14114,31,new_york,14114,"The goal was to control more land for the trapping of animals, a career that most Aboriginal people had turned to in the hope of trading with whites first."
14115,31,new_york,14115," This completely changed the ethnography of the area, and most of the big game was hunted before the whites fully exploded the land."
14116,31,new_york,14116," After that, the Confederacy of the Iroquois offered shelter to refugees from the Muscouten, Erie, Chononton, Tutelo, Saponi and Tuscarora nations."
14117,31,new_york,14117,"In the 1700s, they also merged with the Mohawks during the Franco-Indian war and took to the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after having been decimated in the war."
14118,31,new_york,14118, Most of these other groups were mixed until they ceased to exist.
14119,31,new_york,14119," Then, after the Revolution, a large group split up and returned to Ohio, becoming known as Mingo Senatorca."
14120,31,new_york,14120,"The six tribes of the Iroquois Confederation are currently the Senatorca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Tuscarora and Mohawk."

14123,31,new_york,14123," Meanwhile, the Lenape established a close relationship with William Penn."
14124,31,new_york,14124," However, when Penn died, his sons managed to take up much of their land and banish it in Ohio."
14125,31,new_york,14125," When the U.S. drafted the Indian Expulsion Act, the Lenapes were moved to Missouri, while their cousins, the Mohicans, were sent to Wisconsin."
14126,31,new_york,14126,"In addition, in 1778, the United States relocated the Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario, although they did not stay for long."
14127,31,new_york,14127," They mostly chose to migrate to Canada and merge with the Iroquois, although some moved west and merged with the Lenapes."
14128,31,new_york,14128,"In 1524 Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer in the service of the French crown, explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland, including the port of New York and the bay of Narragansett."
14129,31,new_york,14129,"On 17 April 1524 Verrazzano entered the bay of New York, passing through the strait now called the Narrows in the northern bay which he named Santa Margherita, in honour of the sister of the king of France."
14130,31,new_york,14130,"Verrazzano described it as ""a vast coastline with a deep delta in which each type of boat could pass"" and he added: ""that it extends inside for a league and opens to form a beautiful lake."
14131,31,new_york,14131," This vast water table has warmed up with native boats."""
14132,31,new_york,14132,He landed on the end of Manhattan and perhaps on the furthest point of Long Island.
14133,31,new_york,14133,Verrazzano's stay was interrupted by a storm that pushed him north towards the vineyards of Martha.
14134,31,new_york,14134,"In 1540, French traders from New France built a castle on Castle Island in the current Albany; it was abandoned the following year due to flooding."
14135,31,new_york,14135,"In 1614, the Dutch, under Hendrick Corstiaensen's command, rebuilt the French castle which they called Fort Nassau."
14136,31,new_york,14136,"Fort Nassau is the first Dutch settlement in North America and is located along the Hudson River, also in the current Albany."
14137,31,new_york,14137, This little fort served as a trading post and warehouse.
14138,31,new_york,14138," Located on the floodplain of the Hudson River, the rudimentary ""strong"" was swept away by floods in 1617 and abandoned for good after the construction of Fort Orange, Newfoundland, near 1623."

14140,31,new_york,14140," Sailing for the Dutch East India Company and seeking a passage to Asia, he entered Upper New York Bay on September 11 of the same year."
14141,31,new_york,14141, His findings encouraged Dutch traders to explore the coast in search of a profitable fur trade with local American Aboriginal tribes.
14142,31,new_york,14142,"In the 17th century, Dutch trading posts were established for the trade of hides from Lenape, Iroquois and other tribes."
14143,31,new_york,14143,"The first of these trading posts was Fort Nassau (1614, near Albany today); Fort Orange (1624, on the Hudson River, just south of the present town of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau), developing in the Beverwijck settlement (1647), and in what became Albany; Fort Amsterdam (1625, to develop in the city of New Amsterdam which is now New York City); and Esopus (1653, now Kingston)."
14144,31,new_york,14144,"The success of Rensselaerswyck (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony."
14145,31,new_york,14145,The English seized the colony during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and ruled it as the province of New York.
14146,31,new_york,14146,The city of New York was taken over by the Dutch in 1673 during the third Anglo-Dutch war (1672-1674) and renamed New Orange.

14149,31,new_york,14149,"The Stamp Congress met in the city on 19 October of the same year, composed of representatives of all the Thirteen Colonies that paved the way for the Continental Congress to follow."
14150,31,new_york,14150,"The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the Bill of Rights and Grievances, which was the first written expression by American representatives of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the Declaration of Independence of the United States."
14151,31,new_york,14151, This included the right to a representative government.
14152,31,new_york,14152,"At the same time, given the close commercial, personal and sentimental ties with Britain, many New Yorkers were loyalists."
14153,31,new_york,14153,The capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the gun and powder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the siege of Boston in 1775.
14154,31,new_york,14154,"New York was the only colony not voting for independence, as delegates were not allowed to do so."
14155,31,new_york,14155,New York subsequently endorsed the Declaration of Independence on 9 July 1776.
14156,31,new_york,14156,"The Constitution of the State of New York was conceived by a convention that met in White Plains on July 10, 1776 and after repeated adjournments and change of location, completed its work in Kingston on Sunday evening, April 20, 1777, when the new constitution drafted by John Jay was adopted with a single dissenting voice."

14161,31,new_york,14161," After their victory, the British occupied the city of New York, making it their military and political base of operations in North America throughout the conflict and, consequently, the centre of interest of General George Washington's intelligence network."
14162,31,new_york,14162,"On the famous British prison ships in Wallabout Bay, more American fighters died of intentional negligence than were killed in combat in every battle of the combined war."
14163,31,new_york,14163, Both sides of the fighters lost more soldiers as a result of illness than pure and simple injuries.
14164,31,new_york,14164,"The first of the two great British armies was captured by the Continental Army at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, a success that influenced France to join the revolutionaries.The state constitution was promulgated in 1777."

14167,31,new_york,14167,"In retaliation for the attacks on the border by the Mohawk forces of Joseph Brant and Loyalist, the Sullivan expedition in 1779 destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages, adjacent agricultural lands and winter shops, forcing many refugees to travel to Niagara, under British control."
14168,31,new_york,14168,"As British allies, the Iroquois were forced to leave New York, although they did not participate in the treaty negotiations."

14170,31,new_york,14170,"In the settlement of treaties, the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States."
14171,31,new_york,14171," Since New York entered into a treaty with the Iroquois without Congress' approval, some land purchases have since the end of the 20th century been the subject of land claims by the tribes recognized by the federal government."
14172,31,new_york,14172,"New York has sold more than 5 million acres (20,000 km2) of ancient Iroquois territory in the years following the revolutionary war, leading to rapid development in northern New York."

14175,31,new_york,14175," This organization was found to be insufficient, and prominent New Yorker Alexander Hamilton advocated a new government that would include executive power, national courts and the power to impose."
14176,31,new_york,14176,"Hamilton led the Annapolis Convention (1786), which called for the Philadelphia Convention, which drafted the Constitution of the United States, in which he also participated."
14177,31,new_york,14177,The new government had to be a strong federal government to replace the relatively weak confederation of states.
14178,31,new_york,14178," Following a lively debate, which included the publication of the now quintessence constitutional interpretation – The Federalist Papers – as a series of episodes in New York's newspapers, New York was the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution on July 26, 1788."
14179,31,new_york,14179,"New York remained the national capital under the new constitution until 1790 and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington, the drafting of the United States Bill of Rights and the first session of the United States Supreme Court."
14180,31,new_york,14180,Hamilton's recovery of the heavily indebted U.S. economy after the war and the creation of a national bank have greatly contributed to New York becoming the financial centre of the new nation.

14188,31,new_york,14188, Agricultural products came from the Midwest and finished manufactured goods moved westward.
14189,31,new_york,14189,It was a wonder of engineering that opened large areas of New York to commerce and colonization.
14190,31,new_york,14190,"It has allowed the port cities of the Great Lakes, such as Buffalo and Rochester, to grow and prosper."

14212,31,new_york,14212," Already controlled by the federal government, the island had been used as a ammunition depot."
14213,31,new_york,14213,"It was chosen because of its relative isolation with the proximity of New York City and the railway lines of Jersey City, New Jersey, by a short ferry ride."
14214,31,new_york,14214," While the island was being developed and expanded through land rehabilitation, the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge office at the Battery."
14215,31,new_york,14215,"Ellis Island opened its doors on 1 Jan. 1892 and became a central immigration centre until the passage of the National Origins Act in 1924, thereby reducing immigration."

14221,31,new_york,14221,"Ellis Island was the subject of a long-standing border and jurisdictional dispute between the State of New York and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed."
14222,31,new_york,14222,"The issue was resolved in 1998 by the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that the original island of 3.3 acres (1.3 ha) was the territory of New York State and that the balance of 27.5 acres (11 ha) added after 1834 per landfill was in New Jersey."

14237,31,new_york,14237,The storm and its deep effects led to discussions on the construction of seasides and other coastal barriers around the shores of New York City and Long Island in order to minimize the risks arising from another such occurrence.
14238,31,new_york,14238, Such a risk is considered highly probable due to global warming and sea-level rise.

15141,33,north_dakota,15141,"In recent years, the State has recorded unemployment rates below the national average and has increased employment and population."
15142,33,north_dakota,15142, Much of the growth was based on the development of Bakken oil fields in the western part of the state.

15151,33,north_dakota,15151,"North Dakota is the fourth least populous state in the country; only Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming have fewer residents."
15152,33,north_dakota,15152," With less than 2,000 inhabitants in 1870, the population of North Dakota increased to nearly 680,000 in 1930."
15153,33,north_dakota,15153," Growth then slowed, and the population has fluctuated slightly over the last seven decades, reaching 617,761 people in the 1970 census, with 642,200 people in the 2000 census."

15159,33,north_dakota,15159,"North Dakota was a popular destination known for immigrant farmers and workers in general and their families, mainly Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom."
15160,33,north_dakota,15160," Much of the colony was on the west side of the Red River Valley, as was seen in South Dakota and parallel in Minnesota."
15161,33,north_dakota,15161, This area is well known for its fertile lands.
15162,33,north_dakota,15162,"At the beginning of World War I, it was one of the richest agricultural areas in North America."
15163,33,north_dakota,15163,"But a period of stronger rain ended, and many migrants failed in arid conditions."

15165,33,north_dakota,15165," From 1930 to the end of the 20th century, the North Dakota population gradually declined, interrupted by a few brief increases."

15168,33,north_dakota,15168, Many people have moved to urban areas to find employment.
15169,33,north_dakota,15169," Since the end of the 20th century, one of the main causes of North Dakota migration has been the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates."

16241,36,oregon,16241,"A theory is that the name comes from the French word Ouragan (""windstorm"" or ""hurricane""), which was applied to the West River from Indian tales of powerful Chinook winds on the lower Columbia, or perhaps from the first-hand French experience with the Chinook winds of the Great Plains."

16245,36,oregon,16245," According to Stewart, the name comes from the error of a engraver in a French map published at the beginning of the 18th century, on which the Ouisiconink River (Wisconsin) was spelled ""Ouaricon-sint"", broken on two lines with the -sint below, so there seemed to be a river flowing west called ""Ouaricon""."

17536,39,south_carolina,17536,"The constitution of the state of 1895 overturned it, reducing the role of the counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature; essentially the counties were agents of the state and governed by the General Assembly through the legislative delegation for each county."
17537,39,south_carolina,17537, They are geographically complete
17538,39,south_carolina,17538," Since each county had one state senator, this position was particularly powerful."

17577,39,south_carolina,17577, Additional Amerindian slaves were exported from South Carolina to other American colonies.
17578,39,south_carolina,17578," According to historian Alan Gallay, ""the Indian slave trade was at the heart of the development of the English empire in the American South."

17603,39,south_carolina,17603,"For example, a man was not eligible to sit in the House of State Representatives unless he owns an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 Negroes, or at least Pound150, thereby reducing the electorate."
17604,39,south_carolina,17604,"In addition, the state maintained the indirect election of electors by the legislature until 1868, the last state to do so."

17642,39,south_carolina,17642,"To prevent this from happening again, the Democrats obtained the adoption of a new constitution in 1895 that effectively deprived almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements in terms of voting taxes, residence and literacy tests that considerably reduced the electoral roll."

17828,40,south_dakota,17828,In 1762 the whole region became part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802.
17829,40,south_dakota,17829,"At the beginning of the 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the region."

17839,40,south_dakota,17839,"The Sioux refused to grant mining rights or lands in the Black Hills, and the war broke out after the United States failed to prevent white miners and settlers from entering the area."

17849,40,south_dakota,17849,"The fertile soil was blown into massive dust storms, and several crops were completely destroyed."
17850,40,south_dakota,17850,"The Dust Bowl's experiences, coupled with the seizure of local banks and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, have led to the release of many Dakotas from the south of the state."

17860,40,south_dakota,17860," Despite the increase in the population of the State and recent economic development, many rural areas have struggled over the past 50 years with the decline of local populations and the emigration of educated young adults to the major cities of South Dakota, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states."
17861,40,south_dakota,17861,Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture have greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of small family farms and the resulting economic and demographic difficulties for rural cities.

17871,40,south_dakota,17871," Ethnicly, 2.7 per cent of the population of South Dakota was of Hispanic, Latin or Spanish origin (they may be of any race)."
17872,40,south_dakota,17872,"In 2011, 25.4% of the population of South Dakota under 1 years of age were minorities, meaning that there was at least one parent who was not Hispanic white."

17879,40,south_dakota,17879, Five of the state counties are within the boundaries of sovereign Indian reserves.
17880,40,south_dakota,17880," Due to the limitations of climate and land, and the isolation of urban areas with higher employment opportunities, the standard of living on many South Dakota reserves is often well below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest of the nation in 2009."
17881,40,south_dakota,17881,"The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, Crow Creek Reserve, is 70%, and 21% of households lack basic plumbing or cooking equipment."
17882,40,south_dakota,17882,A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Office found that 58 per cent of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve did not have a telephone.
17883,40,south_dakota,17883,"The isolation of reserves also hinders their ability to generate income from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centres."
17884,40,south_dakota,17884,"In 1995, the legislature passed a law to make English the ""common language"" of the State."
17885,40,south_dakota,17885," Since 2019, ""the language of the Grand Sioux Nation, consisting of three dialects, Dakota, Lakota and Nakota"", is an official language."

17893,40,south_dakota,17893,Young people have moved to cities to find other jobs.
17894,40,south_dakota,17894," This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 counties in South Dakota losing their population between 1990 and 2000."
17895,40,south_dakota,17895," Meanwhile, nine counties suffered a population loss of more than 10 per cent, with Harding County in the northwest corner of the state losing nearly 19 per cent of its population."
17896,40,south_dakota,17896,The low birth rate and the absence of younger immigrants led to an increase in the median age of many of these counties.
17897,40,south_dakota,17897,"In 24 counties, at least 20% of the population is over the age of 65, compared with a national rate of 12.8%."
17898,40,south_dakota,17898," However, the effect of rural flights has not been uniformly spread across South Dakota."

18094,41,tennessee,18094,"At the beginning of the 18th century, British merchants met a city of Cherokee called Tanasi (or ""Tanase"", in the syllable : """") in Monroe County, Tennessee, today."
18095,41,tennessee,18095,The city was located on a river of the same name (now known as Little Tennessee River) and appears on the maps as early as 1725.
18096,41,tennessee,18096,"It is not known if it was the same city as Juan Pardo's, although recent research suggests that Pardo's ""Tanasqui"" was at the confluence of the Pigeon River and the French Broad River near modern Newport."
18097,41,tennessee,18097,The meaning and origin of the term is uncertain.
18098,41,tennessee,18098, Some stories suggest that this is a Cherokee modification of a Yuchi word earlier.

18106,41,tennessee,18106,"Tennessee is known as The Volunteer State, a nickname that some claimed to have won during the War of 1812 because of the important role played by Tennessee volunteer soldiers, especially during the Battle of New Orleans."
18107,41,tennessee,18107," Other sources differ as to the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to the volunteers of the war between Mexico and America from 1846 to 1848."
18108,41,tennessee,18108," This explanation is more likely, because President Polk's call for 2,600 national volunteers at the beginning of the Mexico-America war resulted in 30,000 volunteers from Tennessee alone, largely in response to Davy Crockett's death and the appeals of the former Tennessee governor and then Texas politician Sam Houston."
18109,41,tennessee,18109,"Tennessee borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia in the north; North Carolina in the east; Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi in the south; Arkansas and Missouri in the west."

18167,41,tennessee,18167,"Sportsmen and visitors are attracted to Reelfoot Lake, originally formed by the earthquakes of 1811–12; the stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, as well as the lotus bed covering shallow waters, give the lake a hard beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168," Most of the condition has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in Appalachians, which are classified as having a temperate or humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the major factor in Tennessee's climate, with southern winds accounting for most of the annual rainfall in the state."

18178,41,tennessee,18178," Although the state is far enough away from the coast to avoid any direct impact of a hurricane, the state location makes it likely to be affected by the remnants of tropical cyclones that weaken over the earth and can cause significant rainfall, such as tropical storm Chris in 1982 and hurricane Opal in 1995."
18179,41,tennessee,18179,"The average condition is about fifty days of thunderstorms per year, some of which may be severe with large hail and harmful winds."

18186,41,tennessee,18186,"The capital and largest city are Nashville, although Knoxville, Kingston and Murfreesboro have all served as state capitals in the past."
18187,41,tennessee,18187,The metropolitan area of 13 counties of Nashville is the largest in the state since around 1990.

18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between the first colony and the time of European contact were unknown, but several distinct cultural phases were named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 B.C.), Woodland (1000 B.C. – 1000 B.C.) and Mississippi (1000–1600 B.C.), whose chiefs of staff were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee who lived in the Tennessee Valley before the migration of Cherokee into the river waters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first European excursions recorded in today's so-called Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559 and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo has registered the name ""Tanasqui"" of a local Indian village, which has evolved to the current name of the state."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,At that time Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi.
18197,41,tennessee,18197," Perhaps because of devastating European diseases the Indian tribes, which would have left a vacuum of population, and also because of the expansion of the European colony in the north, the Cherokee moved to the south of the area now known as Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European settlers spread throughout the region, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all the Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw, and finally, the Cherokee in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British colony in today's Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near Vonore today."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,Fort Loudoun became the westmost British outpost to that date.
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard of Brahm and built by forces under the direction of British Captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202," After his completion, Captain Raymond Demeré gave command on 14 Aug. 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203,"War broke out between the British and the neighbour Overhill Cherokees, and the siege of Fort Loudoun ended with his surrender on 7 Aug. 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The next morning, Captain Paul Demeré and several of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison were taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of Eastern and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began to arrive at the end of the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,"The majority of 18th-century settlers were English or mainly English, but nearly 20% were also Scottish-Irish."
18207,41,tennessee,18207," These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on land leased to the Cherokee people."
18208,41,tennessee,18208," During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycomore Shoals (now Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his belligerent faction of Cherokee who were aligned with the British loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209, These Cherokee renegades were designated by settlers as Chickamaugas.
18210,41,tennessee,18210, They opposed the annexation by North Carolina of the Washington District and the simultaneous colonization of Transylvania further north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The lives of many settlers were spared by the first warrior attacks by the warnings of Nancy Ward, cousin of Dragging Canoe."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The border fort, located on the banks of the Watauga River, later served as a gathering place in 1780 for the men of Overmountain to cross the Appalachian Mountains, engage and defeat the British army during the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213, Three counties in the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) left North Carolina in 1784 and formed Franklin State.
18214,41,tennessee,18214," Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (currently eight) had joined North Carolina in 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized in the southwest territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In an effort to encourage settlers to move westward into the new territory, in 1787, the mother state of North Carolina ordered a road to cut to take settlers to the Cumberland colonies – from the south end of Mount Clinch (in Eastern Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Highway"" or ""Trace d'Avery"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Route de la Sauvage"" through the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,Tennessee was admitted to the Union on 1 June 1796 as 16th state.
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It was the first state created from territory under the jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States.
18220,41,tennessee,18220," Apart from the 13 former colonies, only Vermont and Kentucky preceded the establishment of Tennessee, and neither was ever a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, article I, section 31, stipulates that the starting point for the identification of the boundary is the extreme height of the stone mountain, at the point where the Virginia line intersects it, and leads essentially the extreme heights of the mountain ranges through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee after the Amerindian cities of Cowee and Old Chota, from thence along the main ridge of said mountain (mount Unicoi) to the southern boundary of the State; all the territory, lands and waters to the west of said line are included within the limits and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also specified that the boundaries and jurisdiction of the State would include the future acquisition of land, reference to possible land exchanges with other States, or the acquisition of territory west of Mississippi."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As other white settlers settled in Tennessee, they entered into conflict with the Amerindian tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224," During the administration of US President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."
18225,41,tennessee,18225,"U.S. troops forced them to walk from ""emigration depots"" in eastern Tennessee, like Fort Cass, to Indian territory further west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma."
18226,41,tennessee,18226," During this relocation, about 4,000 Cherokees died along the west road."
18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi, ""the path where we shouted""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Amerindians forced to emigrate as a result of the alienation efforts of the Indians from the United States, so the expression ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indians, particularly among the ""Five Civilized Tribes""."
18229,41,tennessee,18229,The sentence was derived from a description of the previous emigration of the Choctaw Nation.
18230,41,tennessee,18230,"In February 1861 secessionists from Tennessee's state government, led by Governor Isham Harris, sought approval of an agreement to break ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a margin of 54-46%."
18231,41,tennessee,18231,"The strongest opposition to secession came from the Eastern Tennessee, which later attempted to form a separate State aligned with the Union."
18232,41,tennessee,18232," Following the confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's appeal for Tennessee and other states in response, Governor Isham Harris began the military mobilization, submitted a secession order to the General Assembly and made direct openings to the confederate government."
18233,41,tennessee,18233,"On May 7, 1861, the legislature of Tennessee ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States."
18234,41,tennessee,18234,"On 8 June 1861, when the inhabitants of the middle Tennessee changed their position considerably, the voters approved a second referendum calling for secession, thus becoming the last state to do so."
18235,41,tennessee,18235,"But Scott's state, supported by the Union, was also established at that time and remained a de facto enclave of the United States throughout the war."
18236,41,tennessee,18236," Many of the major battles of the American civil war were fought in Tennessee, most of the Union's victories."
18237,41,tennessee,18237,Ulysses S. Grant and the U.S. Navy captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862.
18238,41,tennessee,18238, They held the Confederate counter-attack in Shiloh in April.
18239,41,tennessee,18239,"Memphis fell into the Union in June, after a naval battle on the Mississippi River in front of the city."
18240,41,tennessee,18240,The capture of Memphis and Nashville gave Union control of the western and medium sections.
18241,41,tennessee,18241, This control was confirmed at the Battle of Murfreesboro in early January 1863 and the subsequent Tullahoma campaign.

18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution prohibited martial law in its jurisdiction.
18472,41,tennessee,18472, This may be the result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by the U.S. government's Union (North) forces after the American Civil War.
18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee politics, like that of most American states, is dominated by republican and democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474," Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state up to the period of the American civil war; for decades, a third east of the state was strongly republican and two thirds Western voted mostly democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475," This division was linked to the state's model of agriculture, plantation and slavery."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern part was made up of Yemeni farmers, but the middle and western Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton that depended on the use of slave labour."

18480,41,tennessee,18480," After the reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have a competitive party policy, but in the 1880s, the White-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a voting fee for voter registration."

18482,41,tennessee,18482,"In 1900, African-Americans accounted for 23.8 per cent of the state's population, concentrated in the Middle Tennessee and the West."
18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the State Legislative Assembly approved a form of city committee government on the basis of a broad vote for a few positions on a committee council; several cities adopted this as another means of limiting African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,"In 1913, the state legislature enacted a bill allowing cities to adopt the structure without legislative approval."
18485,41,tennessee,18485," After the blacks' inemancipation, the Republican Party of Tennessee became a predominantly white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, with the exception of two republican landslides at the national level of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee closely supported Warren G. Harding over the governor of Ohio James Cox, and in 1928, when he voted more resolutely for Herbert Hoover over the governor of New York Al Smith), the state was part of the Democratic South Solid until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In this post-war decade, he twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former commander of the Allied armed forces during World War II."

18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was only after the mid-1960s and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new mechanisms, such as the governments of the major municipal commissions, were adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491,The old Government.
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former U.S. senator Bill Brock won in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among the Whites for state-wide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493,Tennessee has been selecting governors from various parties since 1970.
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"At the beginning of the 21st century, Republican voters controlled most of the state, especially in rural and suburban areas outside cities; the democratic force was mainly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and was particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter region has a large Afro-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496," Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in the Eastern Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"The 1st and 2nd districts of Tennessee, located respectively in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, are among the few republican historic districts of the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498, Residents of these districts supported the Union on Confederation during the Civil War
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first one has been in the hands of the republicans permanently since 1881, and the Republicans (or their predecessors) have held it for all but four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The second was permanently held by the Republicans or their predecessors since 1859.

18502,41,tennessee,18502," Senator of Tennessee, did not manage to carry his state of origin, an unusual event but revealing the strengthening of Republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503," Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4 per cent in 2000 to 14 per cent in 2004."
18504,41,tennessee,18504," Candidates for the democratic presidency of the southern states, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, are generally better off than their northern counterparts in Tennessee, especially among voters split outside metropolitan areas."

18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, about 30 per cent of state voters identified themselves as independent."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"Baker v. Carr (1962) of the United States Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one vote"", requiring that state legislatures redistribute the distribution of Congress on the basis of decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,He also demanded that both chambers of state legislatures be population-based to be represented rather than geographical districts such as counties.
18511,41,tennessee,18511, This case was the result of a lawsuit that challenged the long-standing rural bias in the allocation of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512," After decades of under-representation of urban populations in many state legislatures, this important decision has led to increased (and proportional) importance in the policy of the state by cities and possibly suburbs, legislators and public office holders in relation to their population within the state."
18513,41,tennessee,18513," This decision also applies to many other states that have long been under the control of rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont and Montana."

18521,41,tennessee,18521,"In 94 of the 95 counties, the Sheriff is the chief of law enforcement in the county and has jurisdiction over the entire county."
18522,41,tennessee,18522," Each Sheriff's Office is responsible for the service of warrants, court security, prison operations and primary law enforcement in unincorporated areas of a county, as well as support to municipal police services."

18529,41,tennessee,18529," Before 1913, the method of execution was suspended."
18530,41,tennessee,18530," From 1913 to 1915 there was an interruption of executions, but they were restored in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531," From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court had ruled (Furman v. Georgia) that the death penalty was unconstitutional, there were no other executions."
18532,41,tennessee,18532,"The death penalty was resumed in 1978, although detainees awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 were mostly sentenced to life imprisonment."

18571,42,texas,18571,"A slave state before the American civil war, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861 and officially joined the Confederate States of America on 2 March of that year."

18589,42,texas,18589,Archaeologists discovered that three large indigenous cultures lived in this territory and reached their peak of development before the first European contact.
18590,42,texas,18590, These included:
18591,42,texas,18591," When the Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Aboriginal people divided into many smaller tribes."
18592,42,texas,18592," These included Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuillecan and Uto-Aztecan."
18593,42,texas,18593,"The peoples of Uto-Aztecan Puebloan lived near Rio Grande in the western part of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived inside, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mainly centered along the Gulf coast."
18594,42,texas,18594,"At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, Aranama, lived in southern Texas."
18595,42,texas,18595,"All this cultural group, mainly centered on the north-east of Mexico, is now extinct."
18596,42,texas,18596,It is difficult to say who lived in the north-western region of the original state.
18597,42,texas,18597,"At the time when the region came to be explored, it belonged to the well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztécan people that had turned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the sixteenth century."
18598,42,texas,18598,"It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siwans."
18599,42,texas,18599, There was no dominant culture in the present Texas region and many people lived there.
18600,42,texas,18600," Native American tribes living within the present boundaries of Texas include Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa and Wichita."
18601,42,texas,18601,"The name Texas derives from táysha, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, meaning ""friends"" or ""allies""."
18602,42,texas,18602,"The area was mainly controlled by the Spaniards during the first two centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution."
18603,42,texas,18603," They were not particularly kind to their native populations, let alone to the Caddoans, who had no confidence because their culture was shared between the Spaniards and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604," When the Spaniards briefly succeeded in conquering the colony of Louisiana, they decided to change tactics and try to be extremely friendly to the Indians, whom they continued even after the French had taken over the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605," Following the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, the United States inherited this strange circumstance."
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred American company and almost all of them migrated to the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spaniards felt swindled after spending so much time and effort and began to try to attract the Caddo, promising them even more land."
18608,42,texas,18608," Apparently, without knowing how they arrived, the United States (which had begun to convince the tribes to separate from the Whites by selling everything and moving west since they purchased Louisiana) faced an overflow of indigenous peoples from Missouri and Arkansas and had been able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced people to settle on unused land in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609," They included Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, all of whom had come to see the Caddoans as saviors, making these peoples very influential."

18614,42,texas,18614,The previous treaties with Spain prohibit both parties from militarizing their native population in any potential conflict between the two nations.
18615,42,texas,18615,"At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans began to spread."
18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans have always been meaningless when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region have never been able to find any solid evidence linking them to it and often it was so far from Caddoan lands, it has made little sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,"It seems very likely that these are false flag attacks aimed at triggering a cascade effect in order to force the natives under Caddoan's influence to enter into an armed conflict without violating any treaty, preferably on the Spanish side."
18618,42,texas,18618," Although no evidence was found of the culprit's identity, Texas officials at the time repeatedly tried to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them under control."
18619,42,texas,18619," Moreover, the Caddoans have never turned to violence because of this, except for self-defence cases."
18620,42,texas,18620,"In the 1830s, the United States had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the tears trail."

18623,42,texas,18623," After the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their indigenous peoples, but did not honour old land claims or agreements."

18637,42,texas,18637, Hostile indigenous tribes and distance from neighbouring Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from settling in the area.

18797,42,texas,18797,Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States of America.
18798,42,texas,18798, Three of its boundaries are defined by watercourses.
18799,42,texas,18799,"The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south."
18800,42,texas,18800,The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas in the north.
18801,42,texas,18801,The Sabine River forms a natural boundary with Louisiana in the east.
18802,42,texas,18802,"Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a northern border with Oklahoma at 36°30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso is located on the western tip of the state at 32° N and the Rio Grande."
18803,42,texas,18803," With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions, regional classification becomes problematic due to differences in soils, topography, geology, precipitation, and plant and animal communities."
18804,42,texas,18804,"A classification system divides Texas, in the order of southeast to west, with respect to the Gulf coastal plains, the inland lowlands, the Great Plains, and the province of the basin and range."
18805,42,texas,18805,The Gulf Coast Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico in the southeastern part of the state.
18806,42,texas,18806,The vegetation of this region consists of thick pine woods.
18807,42,texas,18807,The Low Inland Region consists of gently sloping hilly woodlands and is part of a larger pine and deciduous forest.
18808,42,texas,18808,The Cross Timbers region and the Caprock Escarpment are part of the inland lowlands.
18809,42,texas,18809,"The Great Plains region, in central Texas, crosses the state panhandle and Llano Estacado to the country of the state hills near Austin."
18810,42,texas,18810, This area is dominated by grassland and steppe.
18811,42,texas,18811,"""Far West Texas"" or ""Trans-Pecos"" is the province of the Basin and the state range."
18812,42,texas,18812,"The most varied area includes Sand Hills, Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded slopes and desert meadows."
18813,42,texas,18813,"Texas has 3,700 streams and 15 large rivers, with Rio Grande being the largest."
18814,42,texas,18814," Other important rivers are Pecos, Brazos, Colorado and Red River."
18815,42,texas,18815," While Texas has few natural lakes, texans have built over a hundred artificial reservoirs."
18816,42,texas,18816,"The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation questionable; it can be quite regarded as a state of the South or Southwest, or both."
18817,42,texas,18817,"The great geographical, economic and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits the easy categorization of the entire state into a recognized region of the United States."
18818,42,texas,18818,"Notable extremes range from eastern Texas, which is often seen as an extension from the deep south to the far west of Texas, which is generally recognized as part of the inner southwest."
18819,42,texas,18819,"Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, ending in the south against the folded Western Sierra Madre of Mexico."
18820,42,texas,18820,The continental crust forms a stable mesoproterozoic craton that changes across a wide continental margin and a transition crust into a true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico.
18821,42,texas,18821,"The oldest rocks in Texas date from Mesoproterozoic and date back about 1,600 million years."
18822,42,texas,18822," These igneous and metamorphic precambrian rocks underlie most of the state and are exposed in three locations: the Llano Uprising, Van Horn and Franklin Mountains, near El Paso."
18823,42,texas,18823, Most of these ancient rocks are superimposed by sedimentary rocks.
18824,42,texas,18824,"The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a torn continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time."
18825,42,texas,18825, This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided into the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea.
18826,42,texas,18826, This is the buried ridge of the Appalachian-Ouachita Mountains area of Pennsylvania's continental collision.
18827,42,texas,18827, This orogenous ridge is today buried under the Dallas-Waco-Austin-San Antonio trend.
18828,42,texas,18828,The end of the Paleozoic mountains collapsed as the Jurassic era began to open up the Gulf of Mexico.
18829,42,texas,18829,"Pangea began to separate in the Triassic, but the seafloor extending to form the Gulf of Mexico only appeared in the Jurassic of the middle and the end."
18830,42,texas,18830,The shoreline has moved back to the eastern margin of the state and the passive margin of the Gulf of Mexico has begun to form.
18831,42,texas,18831," Today, 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediment are buried under the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of the remaining U.S. oil reserves are here."
18832,42,texas,18832,"At the beginning of its formation, the nascent basin of the Gulf of Mexico was restricted and seawater often completely evaporated to form thick evaporite deposits of the Jurassic age."
18833,42,texas,18833, These salt deposits form salt domes and are located in eastern Texas along the Gulf Coast.
18834,42,texas,18834,Outcrops in eastern Texas consist of cretaceous and paleogenic sediments that contain significant deposits of eocene lignite.
18835,42,texas,18835,"The Mississippi and Pennsylvania sediments in the north, the Permian sediments in the west, and the Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast, and on the Texas continental shelf contain oil."
18836,42,texas,18836,"The volcanic rocks of the oligocene are found in the extreme west of Texas, in the Big Bend area."
18837,42,texas,18837,A sediment cover of the Miocene known as the Ogallala Formation in the Western High Plains region is an important aquifer.
18838,42,texas,18838," Located far from a tectonic limit of active plaque, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes."
18839,42,texas,18839,A wide variety of animals and insects live in Texas.
18840,42,texas,18840,"It is home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States, 590 native species."
18841,42,texas,18841,At least 12 species have been introduced and breed freely in Texas.
18842,42,texas,18842,"Texas hosts several species of wasps, including an abundance of Polist extamans, and is an important field for the study of Ring Polists."
18843,42,texas,18843,"In spring, the wild flowers of Texas such as the flower of the state, the bluebonnet, the highways of the line through Texas."
18844,42,texas,18844," During the Johnson administration, the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, worked to draw attention to the wild flowers of Texas."
18845,42,texas,18845,The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climatic zones give the condition a very variable time.
18846,42,texas,18846,"The state Panhandle has cooler winters than northern Texas, while the Gulf coast has mild winters."
18847,42,texas,18847,Texas has wide variations in precipitation trends.
18848,42,texas,18848,"El Paso, at the western end of the state, makes an average of 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual precipitation, while parts of southeastern Texas reach an average of 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year."
18849,42,texas,18849,Dallas in the North Central Region averages 37 inches more moderate (940 mm) per year.
18850,42,texas,18850,"Snow falls several times every winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of western Texas, once or twice a year in northern Texas, and once every few years in central and eastern Texas."
18851,42,texas,18851,Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only under rare circumstances.
18852,42,texas,18852,"Note the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm, where 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average temperature is 65°F in December."
18853,42,texas,18853," Maximum summer temperatures are on average 80°F (26°C) in the mountains of western Texas and Galveston Island at approximately 100°F (38°C) in the Rio Grande Valley, but most regions of Texas have consistently high summer temperatures in the range of 90°F (32°C)."
18854,42,texas,18854,Summer temperatures at night range from 50 °F (14 °C) in the western Texas mountains to 80 °F (27 °C) in Galveston.
18855,42,texas,18855,The table below consists of averages for August (usually the warmest month) and January (usually the coldest) in some cities in different regions of the State.
18856,42,texas,18856,"Thunderstorms often hit Texas, especially in the eastern and northern parts of the state."
18857,42,texas,18857,The Tornado Lane covers the northern part of Texas.
18858,42,texas,18858,"The state is experiencing the most tornadoes in the United States, an average of 139 tornadoes per year."
18859,42,texas,18859, These strikes are most common in northern Texas and the Panhandle.
18860,42,texas,18860,"The tornadoes generally occur in Texas during the months of April, May and June."
18861,42,texas,18861, Some of the most destructive hurricanes in American history had an impact on Texas.
18862,42,texas,18862,"In 1875, a hurricane killed approximately 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the city."
18863,42,texas,18863, These events allowed Galveston to take over as the main port city.
18864,42,texas,18864," Hurricane Galveston of 1900 later devastated this city, killing approximately 8,000 people or perhaps up to 12,000 people."
18865,42,texas,18865, That makes it the most deadly natural disaster in American history.
18866,42,texas,18866,"In 2017, Hurricane Harvey made a ground fall in Rockport as a Category 4 hurricane causing significant damage to the site."
18867,42,texas,18867,"The storm lasted a long time, allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain in the Greater Houston area and the surrounding counties."
18868,42,texas,18868, This has resulted in widespread and catastrophic floods that have flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.
18869,42,texas,18869,"Harvey finally became the most expensive hurricane in the world, causing damage estimated at $198.6 billion, exceeding the cost of Hurricane Katrina."
18870,42,texas,18870," Other devastating hurricanes in Texas include Hurricane Galveston of 1915, Hurricane Audrey in 1957, which killed over 600 people, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008."
18871,42,texas,18871," Tropical storms also caused their share of damage: Allison in 1989 and again in 2001, and Claudette in 1979 among them."
18872,42,texas,18872,"In 2017, Texas emits the most greenhouse gases in the U.S. almost twice as much as California, the second most polluting state.In 2017, the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide per year."
18873,42,texas,18873,"As an independent nation, Texas ranks as the seventh largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world."
18874,42,texas,18874,The causes of the state's large greenhouse gas emissions include the large number of state coal-fired power plants and the state's manufacturing and refining industries.
18875,42,texas,18875,"In 2010, there were 2,553 ""emission events"" that contributed 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tonnes) of contaminants to the Texas sky."
18876,42,texas,18876,"The state has three cities with more than one million inhabitants: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas."

18881,42,texas,18881,The metropolitan areas of Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston have about 7.5 million and 7 million inhabitants respectively in 2019.
18882,42,texas,18882," Three interstate highways – the I-35 to the west (Dallas–Fort Worth in San Antonio, with Austin in between), the I-45 to the east (Dallas in Houston), and the I-10 to the south (San Antonio in Houston) define the region of the urban triangle of Texas."
18883,42,texas,18883,"The 160,000-square-kilometre (160,000 km2) area is home to most of the largest cities and metropolitan areas of the state, as well as 17 million people, representing almost 75 per cent of the total population of Texas."
18884,42,texas,18884, Houston and Dallas have been recognized as cities of the world.
18885,42,texas,18885, These cities are distributed between the State.
18886,42,texas,18886," Unlike cities, unincorporated rural settlements, known as settlements, often lack basic infrastructure and are characterized by poverty."
18887,42,texas,18887,"The Texas Attorney General's Office reported in 2011 that Texas had approximately 2,294 colonias and estimated that about 500,000 people lived in colonias."

18891,42,texas,18891," Each county has a judicial system consisting of four elected commissioners (one of each of the four county precincts, divided roughly according to population) and a county judge elected in general from the whole county."
18892,42,texas,18892,"The county government is similar to a ""low"" mayor-counsel system; the county judge has no veto power, but votes with the other commissioners."
18893,42,texas,18893," Although Texas allows cities and counties to enter into ""interlocal arrangements"" to share services, the state does not allow consolidated city and county governments, nor does it have metropolitan governments."

19494,43,utah,19494,"Previous studies have shown a widespread decline in snow quantity above Utah, accompanied by a decline in the snow-precipitation ratio, while anecdotal claims have been made that the measured changes in Utah snow quantity are false and do not reflect actual changes."
19495,43,utah,19495,"A study conducted in 2012 found that the proportion of winter precipitation (January to March) falling as snow has decreased by 9% over the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in precipitation and a slight decrease in snowfall."

19501,43,utah,19501," Temperatures below 0°F (−18°C) should be expected occasionally in most regions of the state in most years, although some regions often see it (for example, the city of Randolph has an average of about fifty days a year with such low temperatures)."
19502,43,utah,19502,"In July, average levels ranged from 85 to 100 °F (29 to 38 °C)."
19503,43,utah,19503," However, low humidity and high altitude generally lead to large temperature variations, resulting in cool nights on most summer days."
19504,43,utah,19504,"The record temperature in Utah was 118°F (48°C), recorded south of St. George on July 4, 2007, and the low record was -69°F (−56°C), recorded at Peter Sinks in the Northern Utah Bear Mountains on February 1, 1985."

19512,43,utah,19512,"One exception, however, was the unprecedented F2 Salt Lake City Tornado, which moved directly to downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999, killing one person, wounding another sixty and causing approximately $170 million in damage."
19513,43,utah,19513,The only other victim of the tornado reported in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on 6 July 1884.

20012,44,vermont,20012," Under the reorganization, the inhabitants of urban areas had to obtain a fair share of the distribution in the two houses in each State."
20013,44,vermont,20013,"Vermont and other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as had several southern states in those years, which had not been redesigned since the beginning of the century."
20014,44,vermont,20014,"Up to that time, the distribution of upper chambers was often based on county courts, which had given more power to rural counties and had not taken into account population growth in urban areas."
20015,44,vermont,20015, This means that urban areas do not have proportional political power and often suffer from under-investment in the necessary infrastructure.

20023,44,vermont,20023," According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 1 July 2019, Vermont had an estimated population of 623,989."
20024,44,vermont,20024," These include a natural increase of 3,178 (31,716 births minus 28,538 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 2,432 people outside the State."

20028,44,vermont,20028,"The demographic evolution between those who have multigenerational links with the state and those who are newcomers, bringing different values with them, has led to a certain tension between the two perspectives."
20029,44,vermont,20029," This tension is expressed in the terms, ""Woodchuck"", applied to those established in the state, and ""Flatlander"", applied to new arrivals.Vermont is the least populated state of New England."
20030,44,vermont,20030,"In 2012, Vermont was one of only two U.S. states with fewer people than the District of Columbia (Wyoming was the other)."
20031,44,vermont,20031," Between 2010 and 2013, 16 of the 251 cities in Vermont experienced an increase in the population."
20032,44,vermont,20032,"All the cities of Chittenden are growing, with the exception of Burlington."
20033,44,vermont,20033,"More than 180 cities have experienced a decline, which had not taken place since the mid-19th century."
20034,44,vermont,20034,"Note: The births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."

20043,44,vermont,20043,"Partly because it has a small population for an American state, it has the smallest number of Hispanics in any state in the country."
20044,44,vermont,20044,The lowest percentage of hispanics was observed in West Virginia.
20045,44,vermont,20045,"The linguists have identified the speech patterns found among the Vermonters as belonging to Western New England English, a dialect of New England English, which presents the complete pronunciation of all r sounds, pronouncing horse and wrapping the same, and pronouncing vowels as father and bothering the same, none of which are traditionally shared features in neighbouring Eastern New England English."
20046,44,vermont,20046," Some rural speakers realize t as a glottal stop (mitten sounds like ""mi'in"" and Vermont as ""Vermon"")."
20047,44,vermont,20047,"A decreasing portion of the Vermont population, generally rural and masculine, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g."
20048,44,vermont,20048," cows with a high vowel like [khyz] and straddle with a sustained vowel, somewhat rounded like [yyd])."
20049,44,vermont,20049,"East of New England English, also present in New Hampshire, Maine and eastern Massachusetts, was common in eastern Vermont in the mid-20th century and before, but it became rare."
20050,44,vermont,20050," This accent dropped the sound r in words ending in r (the farmer sounds like ""farm-uh"") and added a r sound to certain words ending in vowel (idea sounds like ""idee-er"") was common."
20051,44,vermont,20051, These features in eastern Vermont appear to have been inherited from the western part of the country and from Scottish and Irish ancestors.
20052,44,vermont,20052,"In the 21st century, Protestants (30 per cent) and Catholics (22 per cent) made up the majority of those who declared religious preference, with 37 per cent reporting no religion, the highest rate of non-religion in all states."

20083,44,vermont,20083,"In the second half of the 20th century, developers planned to build condos and houses on what was relatively inexpensive, open land."
20084,44,vermont,20084,The Vermont government has responded with a series of laws that control development and pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of the Vermont dairy industry.
20085,44,vermont,20085," Nevertheless, the number of Vermont dairy farms decreased by more than 85% compared to the 11,206 active dairy farms in 1947."

20095,44,vermont,20095,"The dairy stable remains an emblematic image of Vermont, but the 87% decrease in the number of active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003 means that the preservation of dairy stables increasingly depends on a commitment to maintain a legacy rather than a fundamental need in the agricultural economy."
20096,44,vermont,20096,"The Vermont Stable Census, organized in collaboration with educational and not-for-profit programs for the historical preservation of states and local communities, has developed educational and administrative systems to record the number, status and characteristics of stables throughout Vermont."

20100,44,vermont,20100,A significant amount of milk is sent to the Boston market.
20101,44,vermont,20101, This is why the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certifies that Vermont farms meet Massachusetts health standards.

20122,44,vermont,20122,"In the absence of demand, the Vermont forests grow twice as fast as they are."
20123,44,vermont,20123,"An important and growing part of Vermont's economy is the manufacture and sale of artisanal foods, fancy foods and novelty items that are being negotiated in part on the Vermont brand, which the state manages and defends."

20141,44,vermont,20141," Since housing prices did not increase much in the early 2000s, the collapse of real estate values was not so precipitated either."
20142,44,vermont,20142," While seizure increased significantly in 2007, the State ranked 50th, the most favourable, in the ratio between seizures and households."

21064,46,washington,21064,"The frequent rain and cloud cover of western Washington is a major plot point in the popular Twilight book, which is located in western Washington precisely because of its relative lack of sun."
21065,46,washington,21065,"East Washington — the eastern part of the state of the Cascades — has a relatively dry climate, which contrasts sharply with the west side."
21066,46,washington,21066,It includes large semi-arid steppe areas and some really arid deserts in the rain shadow of the Cascades
21067,46,washington,21067," Despite limited rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important activity in most of eastern Washington, as the soil is very productive and irrigation, aided by dams along the Columbia River, is quite widespread."
21068,46,washington,21068,"Population spread in eastern Washington is dominated by access to water, particularly to rivers."
21069,46,washington,21069,The main cities are all located along rivers or lakes; most of them are named after the river or lake they adhere to.
21070,46,washington,21070,"More to the east, the climate becomes less arid, with annual precipitation increasing as one goes east to 21.2 inches (540 mm) at Pullman, near the Washington-Idaho border."

21073,46,washington,21073,"As noted above, Washington's climate varies greatly from west to east."
21074,46,washington,21074,"A Mediterranean climate predominates in western Washington, and a much drier semi-arid climate dominates east of the Cascade Range."
21075,46,washington,21075,"Major factors that determine Washington's climate include the large, high-pressure, low-pressure, semi-permanent systems of the North Pacific Ocean, North American continental air masses, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In the spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the northern Pacific Ocean, causing a clockwise spiral of air."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means that prevailing northwestern winds bring relatively fresh air and a predictable dry season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In autumn and winter, a low pressure cyclone system takes over in the northern Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,"The air that wraps inwards in the opposite direction of the clockwise makes the prevailing winds come from Washington from the southwest, bringing relatively warm and humid air masses and a predictable wet season."
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is commonly used to describe the events of the atmospheric river, where repeated storm systems are led by this persistent cyclone in the tropical and quasi-tropical regions of the Pacific in the northwest Pacific."
21081,46,washington,21081," Although the west of Washington has a marine climate similar to many coastal cities in Europe, there are exceptions such as the events of ""Big Snow"" in 1880, 1881, 1893 and 1916, and the winters of ""Deep Freezing"" in 1883–84, 1915–1916, 1949–1950 and 1955–1956, among others."
21082,46,washington,21082," During these events, western Washington experienced up to 1,800 metres of snow, temperatures below 18 °C, three months of snow on the ground, and frozen lakes and rivers for weeks."
21083,46,washington,21083,"The lowest officially recorded temperature in Seattle is 0°F (−18°C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-lying areas at about three hours from Seattle recorded low temperatures as cold as −48°F (−44°C)."
21084,46,washington,21084,South oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085," During the El Niño phase, the jet enters the United States further south through California, so late autumn and winter are drier than normal with less snow."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet in the Pacific Northwest, so Washington has more rain and snow than the average."
21087,46,washington,21087,"In 2006, the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group published The Impacts of Climate Change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities presented, given the possibility of rising global temperatures and their effects on Washington's state."

21089,46,washington,21089,"The western part of the Olympic Peninsula receives up to 160 inches (4,100 mm) of precipitation each year, making it the wettest area of the 48 neighbouring states and a temperate tropical forest."
21090,46,washington,21090,Weeks can go by without a clear day.
21091,46,washington,21091,"The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the largest annual snowfalls (in some places more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres of water equivalent) across the country."
21092,46,washington,21092,"In the area of the rain shadow east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093, Precipitation then increases eastward towards the Rocky Mountains (approximately 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and waterfalls aggravate this climate pattern by causing the orographical uplift of blown air masses inside the Pacific Ocean, resulting in high levels of precipitation on the wind side of the mountains and low levels on the left side."
21095,46,washington,21095, This happens most dramatically around the Olympic mountains and the Cascade chain.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases, slopes exposed to wind to the southwest receive high precipitation and mild and cool temperatures."
21097,46,washington,21097," Although the Puget Sound lowlands are known for cloud and rain in winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often as snow at higher altitudes."
21098,46,washington,21098,"Mount Baker, near the northern border of the state, is one of the most snowy areas in the world."
21099,46,washington,21099,"In 1999, it established the world record for snowfall in a single season of 1,140 inches (95 feet; 29 metres)."
21100,46,washington,21100,"To the east of the Cascades, a large area experiences strong rain shadow effects."
21101,46,washington,21101," Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington, with the strongest effects of rain shadow at relatively low elevations on the central Columbia Plateau, particularly in the area just east of the Columbia River, from the Snake River to the Okanagan Highlands."
21102,46,washington,21102," Thus, instead of rainforests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry grassland, shrub steppe and sand dunes."
21103,46,washington,21103,The average annual temperature ranges from 51°F (11°C) on the Pacific coast to 40°F (4°C) in the northeast.
21104,46,washington,21104,The lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48°F (−44°C) at Winthrop and Mazama.
21105,46,washington,21105,The highest temperature recorded in the state was 118°F (48°C) at Ice Harbor Dam.
21106,46,washington,21106, Both records were set east of the Cascades.
21107,46,washington,21107,"Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, durable drizzles in winter and warm temperate summers."
21108,46,washington,21108,"The Eastern region, which does not enjoy the general moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean, sometimes has an extreme climate."
21109,46,washington,21109,Winter Arctic cold fronts and summer heat waves are not uncommon.
21110,46,washington,21110," Temperatures in the western region were only 107°F (42°C) in Centralia, and up to 6°F (−21°C) in Longview."
21111,46,washington,21111," Forests cover about half of the territory of the state, mainly west of the Northern Cascades."
21112,46,washington,21112," Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forest area is owned by the state, 64% of which is federal land."
21113,46,washington,21113,"Common trees and plants in the area include camassia, Douglas-fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many ferns."
21114,46,washington,21114,"The various wild areas of the state offer a sanctuary, with large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals."
21115,46,washington,21115,"The Pacific coast surrounding the San Juan Islands is heavily populated by white-headed, grey and humpback whales."
21116,46,washington,21116,"East of Washington, the flora is very different."
21117,46,washington,21117,Tumbleweeds and sage dominate the landscape through vast parts of the countryside.
21118,46,washington,21118," Russian olive trees and other trees are common on the banks of rivers; however, with the exception of river banks, huge parts of eastern Washington have no natural trees at all (although many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course)."
21119,46,washington,21119, There is a greater variety of flora in both the blue mountains and the eastern Cascades.
21120,46,washington,21120," Native state mammals include bats, black bear, bobcat, cougar, coyote, deer, elk, grey wolf, hare, moose, mountain beaver, muskrat, opossum, pocket gopher, rabbit, raccoon, river otter, snout and tree squirrel."
21121,46,washington,21121," Due to the wide geographic diversity, Washington State is home to several different ecoregions, which allow for a varied range of bird species."
21122,46,washington,21122," This range includes raptors, shorebirds, forest birds, prairie birds, ducks, and others."
21123,46,washington,21123," There were also a large number of introduced species in Washington, dating back to the early 18th century, including horses and burros."

21445,47,west_virginia,21445," Some speculative land companies, such as the Vandalia Company, and later the Ohio Company and Indiana Company, attempted to legitimize their land claims in parts of Western Virginia and today the Kentucky, but failed."
21446,47,west_virginia,21446, This rivalry has led some settlers to petition the Continental Congress to create a new territory called Westsylvania.

21452,47,west_virginia,21452,"Subsistence farmers and Yemeni farmers lived in the West and were generally less in favour of slavery, although many counties were divided on their support."
21453,47,west_virginia,21453,The inhabitants of this region became more strongly divided after the elite planters in eastern Virginia voted to separate themselves from the Union during the civil war.

21460,47,west_virginia,21460,An analysis of a local stalagmite in 2010 revealed that Amerindians were burning forests to clear land as early as 100 BC.
21461,47,west_virginia,21461," Some of the regional tribes of the eastern forested lands, which were late prehistoric, were more involved in hunting and fishing, using the method of gardening of the eastern agricultural complex, which used fire to remove the undergrowths of certain areas."

21470,47,west_virginia,21470,"The tribes that inhabited Western Virginia from 1600 onwards were the Siouan Monongahela culture to the north, the Fort Antique culture along the Ohio River from Monongahela to Kentucky, and the extension of an unknown inland distance, and the Siouan Tutelo and Moneton tribes from the east in the southeast."
21471,47,west_virginia,21471," There was also the Iroquoian Susquehannock in the area approximately east of the Monongahela River and north of the Monongahela National Forest, a possible tribe called the Sendrondoa, or Shenandoah, in the Shenandoah Valley and perhaps the easternmost point of the state was the home of the Manahoac people."
21472,47,west_virginia,21472,"The Monongahela may have been the same as a people known as Calicula, or Cali."

21477,47,west_virginia,21477," During the 1750s, when the Mingo Senatorca seceded from the Iroquois and returned to the Ohio River Valley, they claimed that this tribe merged with them."
21478,47,west_virginia,21478,"The Shawnee also arrived, but were mainly stationed in the former Monongahela territory around 1750, but extended their influence throughout the Ohio River region."

21480,47,west_virginia,21480,"The Erie, which were driven out of Ohio around 1655, are now considered to be the same as the Westo, which invaded to South Carolina before being destroyed in 1680."

21490,47,west_virginia,21490," They seize and merge with the Monetons, who begin to name themselves as the Mohetons."
21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicua also began to qualify as Cherokees shortly afterwards, showing an apparent additional fusion."
21492,47,west_virginia,21492, These Shattaras were closely related to the tribes that formed in the south following the Westo – the Yuchi and Cherokee.
21493,47,west_virginia,21493, From 1715 to 1717 the Yamasee War broke out.
21494,47,west_virginia,21494,The senator allegedly took sides for the Yuchi and was reportedly destroyed by Yamasee's allies.
21495,47,west_virginia,21495," Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, it would mean the collapse of the culture of Shattara-Moneton."
21496,47,west_virginia,21496," Another tribe that appears in the area is Canaragay, or Kanawha."

21517,47,west_virginia,21517," During the war, settlers in western Virginia were generally active Whigs and many served in the continental army."
21518,47,west_virginia,21518," However, the Claypool rebellion of 1780–81, in which a group of men refused to pay the taxes imposed by the Continental Army, witnessed the tenacity of war in what became Western Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,Social conditions in western Virginia were totally different from those in the eastern part of the state.
21520,47,west_virginia,21520,"The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable part of the immigration came through Pennsylvania and included Germans, Scottish-Irish Protestants, and settlers from more northerly states."
21521,47,west_virginia,21521,The eastern and southern counties were established primarily by the eastern Virginians.
21522,47,west_virginia,21522," During the American Revolution, the movement for the creation of a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was presented to Congress, on the grounds that the mountains had an almost impassable barrier to the east."
21523,47,west_virginia,21523,"The wilderness of the country made slavery unprofitable, and time only increased the social, political, economic and cultural differences (see Tuckahoe-Cohee) between the two sections of Virginia."
21524,47,west_virginia,21524,"In 1829, a constitutional convention was convened in Richmond to examine reforms to the outdated constitution of Virginia."

21526,47,west_virginia,21526," However, Western reforms have been rejected by the leaders of the Eastern Alleghenies who ""dive into political power in an effort to preserve their way of plantation dependent on the slavery of blacks."""
21527,47,west_virginia,21527, Virginia's leaders maintained a property qualification to effectively deny the right to vote to poor farmers in the West whose families have themselves done much of the agricultural work.
21528,47,west_virginia,21528,"In addition, the 1829–30 convention granted to the counties that held slaves the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population for the distribution of state representation in the United States House of Representatives."
21529,47,west_virginia,21529,"As a result, all but one of the counties west of the Alleghenies voted to reject the constitution, which was nevertheless adopted due to Eastern support."
21530,47,west_virginia,21530,The inability of the Eastern Planter elite to carry out constitutional reforms exacerbated East-West sectism in Virginia and contributed to the subsequent division of Virginia.

21536,47,west_virginia,21536,"The representation of Senators was arbitrarily set at 50 seats, with the West receiving 20 and the East receiving 30 senators."
21537,47,west_virginia,21537," This was made acceptable to the West by a provision that required the General Assembly to resume representation on the basis of the white population in 1865, or that the matter should be submitted to a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the East has also given itself a tax advantage by demanding a real and real property tax, except for slaves."
21539,47,west_virginia,21539," Slaves under the age of 12 were not taxed and slaves over that age were only taxed at $300, a fraction of their real value."
21540,47,west_virginia,21540," However, small farmers had all their property, animals and land taxed at full value."
21541,47,west_virginia,21541," Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the West, the vote was 75,748 in favour and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542," Most of the opposition came from delegates from Eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the West."
21543,47,west_virginia,21543," Given these differences, many in the West have long considered a separate state."
21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men like lawyer Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont had long harassed themselves under the political domination of the slaves of Tidewater and Piedmont."
21545,47,west_virginia,21545,"In addition to the differences on the abolition of slavery, he and the allies felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds for the necessary internal improvements in the West, such as towering towers and railways."
21546,47,west_virginia,21546,West Virginia is the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate State (Virginia) during the American Civil War.
21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the 1861 Virginia Secession Agreement voted for the secession of the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwest corner (who eventually became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favour of the secession order, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548," Almost immediately after the vote, a mass meeting in Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to an assembly to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"At this first meeting, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, but more than a third of the delegates came from the North Panhandle region."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550," Soon, there was a division of sentiment."
21551,47,west_virginia,21551," Some delegates led by John S. Carlile encouraged the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, since Virginia's secession had not yet been adopted by the required referendum (as happened on 23 May), such action would constitute a revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if the Virginians passed the secession order (of which there was no doubt), another convention comprising the elected members of the legislature would meet at Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On May 23, 1861, the secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the order."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on 11 June and stated that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its acts were null and void and all those who had acceded to it had left their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of Western Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of its 103 members, 33 were elected to the Virginia General Assembly on 23 May."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557," These included U.S. senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and others who left their offices to meet at Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558," Other members ""were chosen in an even more irregular way – some at mass meetings, others by county committee, and still others were apparently self-designated."""
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,A law on the reorganization of the government was adopted on 19 June.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The next day, the delegates of the assembly chose Francis H. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, and elected other officers of a rival state government and two U.S. senators (Willy and Carlile) to replace the secessionists before adjourning."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,The Washington federal government quickly recognized the new government and sat on the two new senators.
21562,47,west_virginia,21562, There were therefore two state governments in Virginia: one promising allegiance to the United States and the other to Confederation.
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The Second Wheeling Convention had been suspended until 6 August, then met on 20 August and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new State and a convention to govern a constitution if the vote were to be favourable."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"In the elections of 24 October 1861, 18,408 votes were cast for the new State and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The results of the elections were called into question, since the Union army then occupied the area and the Union troops were stationed at numerous polls to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"It was also election day for the local offices, and elections were also held in the confederate soldiers' camps, which elected rival state officials, such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567, Most pro-state voices came from 16 counties around the North Panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"More than 50,000 votes had been cast on the secession order, but the vote on state status had hardly exceeded 19,000 votes."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, home to Wheeling, only about a quarter of registered voters voted."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote at all, since two-thirds of West Virginia's territory had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,Votes in the counties in favour of secession were most often cast elsewhere by trade unionist refugees from those counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572," Despite this controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to draft a new Constitution for the new State from 26 November 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573," During this constitutional convention, Mr. Lamb of Ohio County and Mr. Carskadon stated that in Hampshire County, out of only 195 votes, 39 were expressed by state citizens; the others were presented illegally by Union soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One of the key figures was Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools, as well as to limit the movement of slaves to the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The education proposal was successful, but the convention tabled the proposals for slavery before completing its work on February 18, 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution is more inspired by Ohio than Virginia, adopting a cantonal government model rather than Virginia's ""courthouse cliques"" than Carlile criticizes, and a compromise required by the Kanawha region (lawyers Charleston Benjamin Smith and Brown) allows counties and municipalities to vote for subsidies for railways or other improvement agencies."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578,"The instrument thus adopted was ratified (18,162 in favour and 514 against) on 11 April 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,"On 13 May 1862, the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state."
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,A request for admission to the Union was made to Congress by Senator Waitman Willey of the restored Virginia government.
21581,47,west_virginia,21581," However, Senator Carlile sought to sabotage the bill by first trying to widen the boundaries of the new state to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then defeating the Willey Amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling law was approved by President Abraham Lincoln, who admitted West Virginia, provided that a provision for the progressive abolition of slavery was included in his constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle insisted with the Wheeling Intelligencer and had also written to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584," Although many felt that West Virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln expressed his opinion on the admission of West Virginia by concluding that ""the body that consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Virginia Legislative Assembly"" and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and timely."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,"The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the request for the abolition of the enabling federal legislation was met."
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,"The revised Constitution was adopted on 26 March 1863 and, on 20 April 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation in which he admitted the state 60 days later, on 20 June 1863."
21587,47,west_virginia,21587," Meanwhile, officers for the new state were selected, while the government."
21588,47,west_virginia,21588,"Pierpont moved his pro-Union capital Virginia to Alexandria occupied by the Union, where he affirmed and exercised jurisdiction over all the other counties of Virginia within the federal lines."
21589,47,west_virginia,21589,The constitutionality of the formation of the new state was then referred to the United States Supreme Court in Virginia v. West Virginia.
21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties on the Potomac east of the mountains in 1863, with the consent of the reorganized Virginia government, voted in favour of annexation to Western Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591, Many electors in the counties strongly in favour of secessionists were absent from the Confederate Army at the time of the vote and refused to recognize the transfer upon their return.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly abrogated the act of secession and, in 1866, brought an action against West Virginia asking the court to declare the counties part of Virginia, allegedly declaring the admission of West Virginia as an unconstitutional state."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593," Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress adopted a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Western Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595," During the civil war, the forces of the General Union George B. McClellan took possession of most of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating in the Battle of Rich Mountain, and control of the Union was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863 General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 confederates, raided much of the state and burned the Pierpont Library, although Senator Willey escaped their capture."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,"Bands of guerrillas burned and looted in certain sections, and were not completely repressed until after the end of the war."
21598,47,west_virginia,21598,"The counties of Panhandle East have been more affected by the war, as military control of the area has changed hands many times."
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The region that became West Virginia has in fact provided about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, about 22,000 to 25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to remove the voting rights of the Confederates' return in order to retain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said that if he were not passed, he would lose the election by 500 votes."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of the confederates could also be confiscated, and in 1866 a constitutional amendment depriving all those who had helped and comforted the confederation of their rights was adopted."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution caused a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,The Democratic Party gained control in 1870 and in 1871 the constitutional amendment of 1866 was repealed.
21605,47,west_virginia,21605,"The first steps towards this change had, however, been taken by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,"On 22 August 1872, an entirely new constitution was adopted."
21607,47,west_virginia,21607," From the reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states challenged the state's share of the debts of the pre-war government of Virginia, which had been primarily committed to financing the improvement of public infrastructure, such as canals, roads and railways, under the leadership of the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,"The Virginians, under the leadership of former Confederate General William Mahone, formed a political coalition based on that: the Readjuster Party."
21609,47,west_virginia,21609," Although the first constitution of West Virginia provided for the taking over of part of Virginia's debt, the negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were unsuccessful and, in 1871, Virginia financed two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily allocated the rest to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally resolved in 1915, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The last payment of this amount was made in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612," After the reconstruction, the new state of the 35th State benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613," Saltpeter caves were used throughout Appalachia to manufacture ammunition; the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the Saltpeter Trail, a chain of limestone caves containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were returned and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail extends from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the road in the town of Union, Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615," Nearly half of these caves are on the west side of Virginia, including the organ cave and the Haynes cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"At the end of the 18th century, Haynes Cave saltpeter miners found large animal bones in the depots."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617," These documents were sent by a local historian and border soldier, Colonel John Stuart, to Thomas Jefferson."
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were called Megalonyx jeffersonii, or big claw, and were known as Jefferson's three-foot sloth."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,It was declared an official fossil of the state of Western Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The official rock of the state of West Virginia is the bituminous coal, and the official gemstone of the state is silicified fossil Mississippi Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621," Limestone has also produced a useful, usually small, quarry industry and softer, high-calcium seams have been burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622," This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years, a specific portion of the C & O railway transported limestone to Clifton Forge, Virginia, as an industrial stream."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"The extraction of salt had been under way since the 18th century, although it played largely in the era of the American civil war, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a precious commodity of the first Confederate forces, and later of the Union."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In the years that followed, more sophisticated extraction methods would restore the role of Western Virginia as the leading salt producer."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625," However, in the second half of the 19th century, there was an even greater treasure that was not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626,It would fuel much of the industrial revolution in the United States and steam ships from many of the world's marines.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627, Residents (indigenous and early European settlers) have long known the underlying coal and could use it for heating and fuel.
21628,47,west_virginia,21628," However, for a long time, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629," After the war, with the new railroads came a practical method of transporting large quantities of coal to the expansion of American and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630,"As the anthracite mines in northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began playing during the same period, investors and industrialists concentrated new interests in West Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted have studied potential coal deposits and invested in land-based and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) railway across the state to the new town of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the coal field of the new river.
21633,47,west_virginia,21633," Soon, the C&O was building its huge coal dock at Newport News, Virginia, on the large harbour of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new owners of the former Atlantic Railway, Mississippi and Ohio (AM&O), which extended across southern Virginia from Norfolk, had clearly established views of the state of the mountains, where the landowners owned vast lands."
21635,47,west_virginia,21635," Their railway was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railway city was developed in Roanoke to manage the planned expansion."
21636,47,west_virginia,21636," After his new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party travelled on horseback and first-hand saw the rich coal bituminous seam, which Kimball's wife named Pocahontas, the N&W reoriented its planned expansion westward to reach it."
21637,47,west_virginia,21637, Soon the N&W also shipped new coal jetties to Hampton Roads.
21638,47,west_virginia,21638,"In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and western railway lines, the important coal-mining centre of Bluefield, West Virginia was founded."
21639,47,west_virginia,21639,"The capital of the Pocahontas coalfield, this town would remain the largest city in the southern part of the state for several decades."
21640,47,west_virginia,21640,"She shares a sister city with the same name, Bluefield, Virginia."
21641,47,west_virginia,21641,"In the northern part of the state and elsewhere, the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and other lines also developed to take advantage of coal opportunities."
21642,47,west_virginia,21642,The B&O has developed coal batteries in Baltimore and several locations on the Great Lakes.
21643,47,west_virginia,21643," Other major coal rail carriers include the Western Maryland Railway (WM), the Southern Railway (SOU), and the Louisville and Nashville Railway (L&N)."
21644,47,west_virginia,21644,"A delayer, the Virginian Railway (VGN), is particularly remarkable."
21645,47,west_virginia,21645,"By 1900, only the most rugged terrain in southwestern Virginia was at some distance from existing railways and mining activity."
21646,47,west_virginia,21646,"In this area to the west of the New River coalfield, Raleigh and Wyoming counties, the Winding Gulf coalfield was later promoted as the ""coalfield in billions of dollars""."
21647,47,west_virginia,21647,"Ansted's protégé was William Nelson Page (1854–1932), civil engineer and mining manager in Fayette County."
21648,47,west_virginia,21648,"The former Governor of West Virginia William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land ""as a farmer knows a field."""
21649,47,west_virginia,21649," From 1898, Page teamed up with investors from the north and Europe to take advantage of the undeveloped area."
21650,47,west_virginia,21650," They acquired extensive tracts of land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short-line railway chartered to stretch between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka, a distance of approximately 80 miles (130 km)."
21651,47,west_virginia,21651," Although the Deepwater plan should have offered a competitive marine transportation contract by either railway, the managers of the two major railways did not appreciate the plan."
21652,47,west_virginia,21652,"In secret collusion, everyone refused to negotiate favorable tariffs with Page, and did not offer to buy their railway, as they had many other short lines."
21653,47,west_virginia,21653," However, if the presidents of C&O and N&W thought that they could kill the Page project, they had to be wrong."
21654,47,west_virginia,21654,"One of Page's silent investors-partners was the million-dollar industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a director of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, and an old hand in natural resource development and transportation."
21655,47,west_virginia,21655,"Master in competitive ""war"", Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his efforts and also had ""deep pockets."""
21656,47,west_virginia,21656," Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and built their tracks to the east of Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost."
21657,47,west_virginia,21657," With the completion of the Virginian Railway (VGN) in 1909, as many as three railways were shipping ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads."
21658,47,west_virginia,21658,West Virginia coal demand was also high in Great Lakes harbours.
21659,47,west_virginia,21659,"The NGV and N&W have finally become part of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the well-designed 21st century NGV tracks continue to provide a favourable gradient for Hampton roads."
21660,47,west_virginia,21660,"As coal mining and related work became important employment activities in the State, working conditions, safety issues and economic concerns arose."
21661,47,west_virginia,21661," Even in the twenty-first century, mining safety and environmental concerns are still difficult for the state whose coal continues to supply power plants in many other states."
21662,47,west_virginia,21662," Coal is not the only precious mineral found in West Virginia, since the state was the site of the discovery in 1928 of the 34.48 carat Jones diamond (6.896 g)."
21663,47,west_virginia,21663," Located in the Appalachian Range, West Virginia covers an area of 62,754.8 km2, with 62,361.0 km2 of land and 393.8 km2 of water, making it the 41st state of the United States."
21664,47,west_virginia,21664,"Western Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest, and Kentucky in the southwest."
21665,47,west_virginia,21665," Its longest border was with Virginia at 381 miles (613 km), followed by Ohio at 243 miles (391 km), Maryland at 174 miles (280 km), Pennsylvania at 118 miles (190 km), and Kentucky at 79 miles (127 km)."
21666,47,west_virginia,21666,"West Virginia is entirely located in the Appalachian region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi (""The mounttains are always free"")."
21667,47,west_virginia,21667, Heights and robustness fall near large rivers like the Ohio River or Shenandoah.
21668,47,west_virginia,21668, About 75% of the state is located in the Cumberland Plateau and the Allegheny Plateau.
21669,47,west_virginia,21669," Although the terrain is not high, the plateau area is very rugged in most regions."
21670,47,west_virginia,21670,"The average elevation of West Virginia is about 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, the highest of all U.S. states east of the Mississippi River."
21671,47,west_virginia,21671,"On the eastern line of the state with Virginia, peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region give rise to an island of cooler climate and ecosystems similar to those in northern New England and eastern Canada."
21672,47,west_virginia,21672,"The highest point in the state is the top of Spruce Knob, at 1863 feet (1,482 m), and is covered in a dense spruce boreal forest at an altitude greater than 4,000 feet (1,200 m)."
21673,47,west_virginia,21673, Spruce Knob is located in the Monongahela National Forest and is part of Spruce Knob-Senatorca Rocks National Recreation Area.
21674,47,west_virginia,21674,"In all, six wild areas are also found in the forest."
21675,47,west_virginia,21675," From the outside of the forest to the south, the gorge of the New River is a 300 metre deep canyon carved by the New River."
21676,47,west_virginia,21676,The National Parks Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the National Park and the New River Gorge Reserve.
21677,47,west_virginia,21677, Other areas for protection and management include:
21678,47,west_virginia,21678," Most of West Virginia lies in the mixed ecoregion of the Appalachian Mesophyte forests, while the high elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie in the Appalachian and Blue Ridge forests."
21679,47,west_virginia,21679,"The native vegetation of most of the state was originally a mixed forest of oaks, chestnuts, maples, beech and white pines, with American willow and sycamore along the rivers of the state."
21680,47,west_virginia,21680," Many of these areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact appreciated by the Western Virginians, who refer to their home as almost heaven (of the song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" by John Denver)."
21681,47,west_virginia,21681," Prior to the song, it was known as ""The Cog State"" (coal, oil and gas) or ""The Mountain State""."
21682,47,west_virginia,21682,"The underlying rock strata are sandstone, shale, bituminous coal beds, and limestone placed in an environment close to the coast from sediments from mountains to the east in a shallow inland sea to the west."
21683,47,west_virginia,21683," Some beds illustrate a coastal swampy environment, a river delta, a few shallow waters."
21684,47,west_virginia,21684,"Sea levels rose and fell repeatedly during the Mississippi and Pennsylvania eras, giving a variety of rocky strata."
21685,47,west_virginia,21685,"The Appalachians are among the oldest on earth, having formed more than 300 million years ago."
21686,47,west_virginia,21686,"West Virginia's climate is generally a humid subtropical climate (classification of the climate of Köppen Cfa, with the exception of Dfb at higher altitudes) with hot to hot, humid and cold winters, increasing in severity with elevation."
21687,47,west_virginia,21687, Some areas of the southern highlands also have a temperate mountain climate (Köppen Cfb) where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are slightly cooler.
21688,47,west_virginia,21688," However, time is subject in all regions of the state to change."
21689,47,west_virginia,21689,Hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the Central Appalachian Mountains to zone 7a in the warmest areas of the lowest altitudes.
21690,47,west_virginia,21690,"In the Eastern Panhandle and Ohio Valley, temperatures are warm enough to see and cultivate subtropical plants such as Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Myrtle Crepe, Albizia julibrisin, American sweetgum, and even needle palm and minor sabal."
21691,47,west_virginia,21691, These plants don't thrive as well in other parts of the state.
21692,47,west_virginia,21692,The Eastern prickly pear grows well in many parts of the state.
21693,47,west_virginia,21693, Average January temperatures range from approximately 26°F (−4°C) near the Cheat River to 41°F (5°C) along the portions of the Kentucky border.
21694,47,west_virginia,21694,The July averages range from 67°F (19°C) along the northern Potomac River to 76°F (24°C) in the western part of the state.
21695,47,west_virginia,21695,It is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state.
21696,47,west_virginia,21696,The highest recorded temperature in the state was 112°F (44°C) at Martinsburg on 10 July 1936 and the lowest recorded temperature at -37°F (−38°C) at Lewisburg on 30 December 1917.
21697,47,west_virginia,21697," Annual precipitation ranges from less than 32 inches (810 mm) in the lower east to more than 56 inches (1,400 mm) in the upper parts of the line of allegiance."
21698,47,west_virginia,21698,The eastern valleys are less rainy because the ridges of the Allegheny mountain in the west create a partial rain shadow.
21699,47,west_virginia,21699,Slightly more than half of the precipitation occurs between April and September.
21700,47,west_virginia,21700,"Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section, especially in the Tygart Valley."
21701,47,west_virginia,21701,"West Virginia is also one of the most cloudy states in the nation, with the cities of Elkins and Beckley ranking 9th and 10th respectively in the United States for the number of cloudy days per year (more than 210)."
21702,47,west_virginia,21702,"In addition to the persistent cloudy sky caused by the degradation of humidity by the Alleghenies, West Virginia is also experiencing some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation, with snowshoes on average nearly 200 days a year with rain or snow."
21703,47,west_virginia,21703,"Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections, but may persist for weeks in the upper mountainous regions."
21704,47,west_virginia,21704,"An average of 34 inches (860 mm) of snow falls each year in Charleston, although in the winter of 1995-96, more than three times this amount decreased, with several cities in the state setting new snowfall records."
21705,47,west_virginia,21705," Average snowfall in the Highlands of Allegheny can reach up to 180 inches (4,600 mm) per year."
21706,47,west_virginia,21706,"Violent weather is a little less common in West Virginia than in most other eastern states, and it ranks among the least tornado-like states east of the Rocky Mountains."
21707,47,west_virginia,21707,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of West Virginia was 1,792,147 on July 1, 2018, representing a 3.28 per cent decrease from the 2010 U.S. Census."

21711,47,west_virginia,21711,"In 2019, the population of West Virginia is estimated at 1,792,147, a decrease of 10,025 (0.55%) from the previous year and a decrease of 47,162 (2.55%) from the previous census."
21712,47,west_virginia,21712," This includes a natural decrease of 3,296 (108,292 births minus 111,588 deaths) and an increase in net migration of 14,209 in the state."
21713,47,west_virginia,21713,West Virginia is the least populous state in the southeast.

21719,47,west_virginia,21719,People of English descent are present throughout the state.
21720,47,west_virginia,21720, Many Western Virginians who identify as Irish are actually Scottish-Irish Protestants.
21721,47,west_virginia,21721,Data from the 2010 Census show that 16 per cent of West Virginia residents are 65 years of age or older (exceeding only 17 per cent in Florida).
21722,47,west_virginia,21722,"In 2006, 20,928 births were registered."

22362,49,wyoming,22362," Almost half of Wyoming's land is owned by the U.S. government, leading Wyoming to rank sixth by region and fifth by proportion of federal government land."
22363,49,wyoming,22363,"Federal lands include two national parks – Grand Teton and Yellowstone – two national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries and wildlife refuges."
22364,49,wyoming,22364,"The first inhabitants of the region include Arapaho, Crow, Lakota and Shoshone."
22365,49,wyoming,22365,Southwest Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire and then as Mexican territory until it was surrendered to the United States in 1848 at the end of the war between Mexico and America.
22366,49,wyoming,22366,"The region became known as ""Wyoming"" when a bill was introduced in Congress in 1865 to provide a temporary government for Wyoming territory."
22367,49,wyoming,22367,"The name had been used earlier for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, and is derived from the word Munsee xwé:wam=nk, which means ""to the great flat of the river""."

22372,49,wyoming,22372,"One of the most important is Teton County, which obtained the notability of being Wyoming's most democratic county and has not voted for a Republican since 2000."
22373,49,wyoming,22373,Wyoming's climate is generally semi-arid and continental (Köppen BSk climate classification) and is drier and more windy than most United States with higher extreme temperatures.
22374,49,wyoming,22374, This is largely due to the topography of the State.
22375,49,wyoming,22375,Summers in Wyoming are warm with high July temperatures averaged between 85 and 95°F (29 and 35°C) in most of the state.

22380,49,wyoming,22380,Wyoming is a dry condition with much of the land receiving less than 10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation per year.
22381,49,wyoming,22381, Precipitation depends on altitude with lower areas in the Big Horn Basin of an average of 5 to 8 inches (130 to 200 mm) (which makes the region almost a desert).
22382,49,wyoming,22382," Lower areas in the North and in the Eastern Plains generally average about 10-12 inches (250-300 mm), making the climate semi-arid."
22383,49,wyoming,22383," Some mountain regions receive a good amount of precipitation, 20 inches (510 mm) or more, mostly as snow, sometimes 200 inches (510 cm) or more per year."

22391,49,wyoming,22391,"Wyoming is one of only three states (the others being Colorado and Utah) with boundaries defined by only ""right"" lines."
22392,49,wyoming,22392," Due to the inaccuracy of surveys during the 19th century, Wyoming's legal boundary deviates from the actual latitude and longitude lines up to half a mile (0.8 km) in some places, particularly in the mountainous region along the 45th parallel."
22393,49,wyoming,22393,"Wyoming is bounded to the north by Montana, to the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, to the south by Colorado, to the south-west by Utah, and to the west by Idaho."

22409,49,wyoming,22409,"The Snake River in northwestern Wyoming eventually flows through the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean, as does the Green River in the Colorado Basin."

22423,49,wyoming,22423,"The reservation houses 2,500 Shoshone East and 5,000 Arapaho North."
22424,49,wyoming,22424, Chief Washakie established the reserve in 1868 after negotiations with the federal government in the Fort Bridger Treaty.
22425,49,wyoming,22425," However, the Northern Arapaho were forced by the federal government to the Shoshone Reserve in 1876, after the government did not provide a separate promised reserve."
22426,49,wyoming,22426," Today, the Wind River Indian Reserve is jointly owned, with each tribe having a 50% interest in land, water and other natural resources."
22427,49,wyoming,22427,"The reserve is a sovereign and autonomous land, with two independent governing bodies: the Eastern Shoshone Tribu and the Northern Arapaho Tribu."
22428,49,wyoming,22428," Until 2014, the Shoshone Business Council and the Northern Arapaho Business Council met as the Joint Business Council to decide on issues that affect both tribes."
22429,49,wyoming,22429,Six elected members of the council of each tribe shall serve on the Joint Council.
22430,49,wyoming,22430," Nearly half of Wyoming's land (approximately 30,099,430 acres (121,808.1 km2)) is owned by the federal government; the state still owns 3,864,800 acres (15,640 km2)."
22431,49,wyoming,22431," Most are administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service in many national forests and in a national prairie, not to mention extensive ""public"" lands and an air base near Cheyenne."
22432,49,wyoming,22432, There are also areas managed by the National Park Service and agencies such as the United States.
22433,49,wyoming,22433,Fish and wildlife service.
22434,49,wyoming,22434, Several Amerindian groups originally lived in the region now known as Wyoming.
22435,49,wyoming,22435,"The Crow, Arapaho, Lakota and Shoshone were just some of the first white explorers to meet during their first visit to the region."
22436,49,wyoming,22436," What is now southwestern Wyoming became part of the Spanish Empire, and later Mexican territory, Alta California, until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican-American War."
22437,49,wyoming,22437,"The French-Canadian trappers of Quebec and Montreal ventured into the area at the end of the 18th century, leaving French toponyms such as Téton and La Ramie."
22438,49,wyoming,22438,"John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, himself led by French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his young wife Shoshone, Sacagawea, first described the area in 1807."

22442,49,wyoming,22442,"In 1850 Jim Bridger located what is now known as Bridger Pass, which the Union Pacific Railroad used in 1868, as did Interstate 80, 90 years later."
22443,49,wyoming,22443,"Bridger also explored Yellowstone and tabled reports on the area, which, like Colter's, were widely regarded at the time as great stories."
22444,49,wyoming,22444,"The area acquired Wyoming's name in 1865, when representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio introduced a bill to Congress to provide a ""temporary government for Wyoming's territory."""
22445,49,wyoming,22445,"The territory was named after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, famous for Thomas Campbell's 1809 poem Gertrude of Wyoming, based on the Battle of Wyoming in the American Revolutionary War."
22446,49,wyoming,22446,"The name eventually derives from the word Munsee xwé:wam=nk, meaning ""to the great river dish""."
22447,49,wyoming,22447,"The population of the area continued to grow after the Union Pacific railway reached Cheyenne in 1867, and the federal government created the Wyoming Territory on 25 July 1868."
22448,49,wyoming,22448,"Wyoming lacked significant deposits of gold and silver, unlike the mineral-rich Colorado, and did not experience the growth of the related population of Colorado."
22449,49,wyoming,22449," However, South Pass City experienced a short-lived boom after the Carissa mine began producing gold in 1867."
22450,49,wyoming,22450,"In addition, copper has been mined in certain areas between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the snowfield near Grand Encampment."
22451,49,wyoming,22451," Once the government-sponsored expeditions to Yellowstone began, Colter and Bridger's reports, previously believed apocryphal, turned out to be true."
22452,49,wyoming,22452," This led to the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, which became the first national park in the world in 1872."
22453,49,wyoming,22453, Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park is located within the northwest border of Wyoming.
22454,49,wyoming,22454,"On December 10, 1869, the Governor of the Territory, John Allen Campbell, extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and, later, the State of the United States, to give women the right to vote."
22455,49,wyoming,22455,Wyoming has also been a pioneer in welcoming women into politics.

22461,49,wyoming,22461, Congress admitted Wyoming to the Union as the 44th state on 10 July 1890.
22462,49,wyoming,22462,"Wyoming was the scene of the War of 1892 in Johnson County, which broke out between competing groups of cattle breeders."
22463,49,wyoming,22463,The adoption of the Federal Homestead Act has led to an influx of small-scale farmers.
22464,49,wyoming,22464,A war of scope broke out when either or both groups chose a violent conflict over commercial competition in the use of public lands.
22465,49,wyoming,22465,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Wyoming had 578,759 inhabitants in 2019, Wyoming's population centre is located in Natrona County."

22469,49,wyoming,22469,"Ethnically, 8.9% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latin origin (they may be of any race) and 91.1% was non-Hispanic, with non-Hispanic whites being the largest non-Hispanic group (85.9%)."
22470,49,wyoming,22470,"In 2015, Wyoming had an estimated population of 586,107, an increase of 1,954, or 0.29%, compared to the previous year and 22,481, or 3.99%, since the 2010 census."
22471,49,wyoming,22471," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase from the net migration of 4,035 to the State."
22472,49,wyoming,22472,"Immigration has resulted in a net increase of 2,264 people and migration within the country has resulted in a net increase of 1,771."

22475,49,wyoming,22475,"Wyoming, which is sparsely populated, is the least populated in the United States."
22476,49,wyoming,22476,Wyoming has the second lowest population density in the country (behind Alaska) and is the sparsest population in the 48 contiguous states.
22477,49,wyoming,22477,It is one of only two states (Vermont) whose population is less than that of the national capital.
22478,49,wyoming,22478," According to the 2000 Census, Wyoming's main ancestry groups are German (26.0%), English (16.0%), Irish (13.3%), Norwegian (4.3%) and Swedish (3.5%)."
22479,49,wyoming,22479,"Note: The births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."
22480,49,wyoming,22480,"The Constitution of Wyoming established three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
22481,49,wyoming,22481,The legislative power of the State consists of a 60-member House of Representatives and a 30-member Senate.
22482,49,wyoming,22482,"The Executive is headed by the Governor and includes a Secretary of State, an auditor, a treasurer and a director of public education."
22483,49,wyoming,22483,Wyoming has no lieutenant governor.
22484,49,wyoming,22484,The Secretary of State is the first in the succession line.
22485,49,wyoming,22485,"The small population of Wyoming guaranteed him only one seat in the House of Representatives of the United States, and thus only three votes in the electoral college."
22486,49,wyoming,22486,"The Wyoming State Liquor Association is the only legal distributor of government spirits, making it a state of control over alcoholic beverages."

22488,49,wyoming,22488,"Wyoming's highest court is the Wyoming Supreme Court, with five judges presiding over appeals from lower state courts."
22489,49,wyoming,22489,"Wyoming is unusual as it does not have an intermediate court of appeal, like most states."
22490,49,wyoming,22490, This is largely due to the population of the State and the reduced workload.
22491,49,wyoming,22491,The appeals of the District Courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
22492,49,wyoming,22492,"Wyoming also has limited state circuit courts (formerly county courts), which deal with certain types of cases, such as civil claims with smaller amounts, criminal offences and criminal prosecution."
22493,49,wyoming,22493,It is also common for the judges of the travelling courts to hear cases involving small claims.
22494,49,wyoming,22494," Prior to 1972, Wyoming judges were chosen by popular vote by non-partisan ballot."
22495,49,wyoming,22495," This earlier system was criticized by the State Bar, which called for the adoption of the Missouri Plan, a system designed to balance the independence of the judiciary with judicial responsibility."
22496,49,wyoming,22496,"In 1972, voters adopted an amendment to Article 5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which contains an amended version of the plan."
22497,49,wyoming,22497," Since the amendment was adopted, all judges of Wyoming State Courts have been appointed by the Judicial Appointment Commission and appointed by the Governor."
22498,49,wyoming,22498, They are then subject to a retention vote of the electorate one year after their appointment.
22499,49,wyoming,22499,Wyoming's political history challenges the easy ranking.
22500,49,wyoming,22500,The State was the first to grant women the right to vote and elect a woman governor.
22501,49,wyoming,22501,"On December 10, 1869, John Allen Campbell, the first governor of Wyoming territory, approved the first law in U.S. history explicitly granting women the right to vote."
22502,49,wyoming,22502, That day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day.
22503,49,wyoming,22503,"On November 5, 1889, voters approved the first constitution in the world that grants women the right to vote."
22504,49,wyoming,22504," While the state elected prominent democrats to the federal office in the 1960s and 1970s, politics became resolutely more conservative since the 1980s, when the Republican Party came to dominate the delegation of the State Congress."
22505,49,wyoming,22505," Today Wyoming is represented in Washington by his two senators, John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and his only member of the House of Representatives, Liz Cheney."
22506,49,wyoming,22506,All three are Republicans.
22507,49,wyoming,22507,"The state has not voted for a democrat for the president since 1964, one of only eight times since the state's status."
22508,49,wyoming,22508," Currently, there is only one relatively reliable democratic county, the Teton tributary, and a swing county, Albany University County."
22509,49,wyoming,22509,"In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won his second victory with 69 per cent of the vote."
22510,49,wyoming,22510, Former Vice President Dick Cheney is a resident of Wyoming and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.
22511,49,wyoming,22511,"The Republicans do not, however, dominate at the state level."
22512,49,wyoming,22512, They have held a majority in the Senate since 1936 and in the state house since 1964.
22513,49,wyoming,22513," However, the Democrats held the office of governor every eight years except between 1975 and 2011."
22514,49,wyoming,22514,"In particular, Wyoming elected democrat Nellie Tayloe Ross as the first woman in the history of the United States to be governor of state."
22515,49,wyoming,22515,"She served from 1925 to 1927, winning a special election after her husband, William Bradford Ross, suddenly died a little over a year in her term."
