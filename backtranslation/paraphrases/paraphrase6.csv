122,0,alabama,122,"The continuation of racial discrimination and lynching, the agricultural depression and the failure of cotton crops due to the infestation of ploughs has led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural areas of Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in the cities of the north and west in the first decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South."
123,0,alabama,123,"In view of this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see the table ""historical populations"" below) declined by almost half between 1910 and 1920."

136,0,alabama,136, They have maintained an old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
137,0,alabama,137,"As a result, Jefferson County, home to Birmingham's industrial and economic power, paid more than a third of all tax revenues to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests are still underrepresented in the legislature.
139,0,alabama,139," According to a study carried out in 1960, due to rural domination, ""a minority of about 25 per cent of the total population of the State controls the majority of the Alabama Legislative Assembly""."
140,0,alabama,140,"In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" should be the basis of both chambers of state legislatures, and that their districts should be based on population rather than geographic counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the redistribution of the Congress on the basis of the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142," This has benefited urban areas that have developed, as well as the population as a whole that has been underrepresented for more than sixty years."
143,0,alabama,143, Further changes have been made to the establishment of a representative state house and senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144," African-Americans continued to exert pressure in the 1950s and 1960s to end exclusion and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools should be disaggregated, but Alabama was slow to comply."
146,0,alabama,146,"In the 1960s, under the leadership of Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted federal desegregation requirements."
147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement experienced significant events in Alabama, including the boycott of the Montgomery buses (1955-1956), the Freedom Rides in 1961 and the Selma marches up to Montgomery in 1965."
148,0,alabama,148, They contributed to the adoption and adoption by the U.S. Congress of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
149,0,alabama,149," Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow's customs often continued until it was specifically challenged in court."
150,0,alabama,150," According to the New York Times, in 2017, many Afro-Americans from Alabama lived in the cities of Alabama, such as Birmingham and Montgomery."
151,0,alabama,151,"In addition, the area of the black belt in the centre of Alabama ""shelters largely poor counties which are mainly African-American."
152,0,alabama,152," These counties are Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made some changes since the end of the 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus redistriction case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the general vote for seats representing 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155," Voting in general had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, with the majority tending to take all seats."
156,0,alabama,156," Despite African-Americans who constitute an important minority in the state, they have not been able to elect any representative in most jurisdictions in general."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of the resolution of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, have adopted a cumulative voting system for the election of representatives in multiple-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158, This has led to more proportional representation of voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County."
160,0,alabama,160,"In 1982, the limited vote was tested for the first time in Conecuh County."
161,0,alabama,161," Together, the use of these systems has increased the number of African American women and women elected to local offices, leading to governments that are more representative of their citizens."
162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth state of the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of the total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in quantity of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the United States."

175,0,alabama,175,"It is the Wetumpka crater, the site of Alabama's greatest natural disaster."
176,0,alabama,176,A 300-metre meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.
177,0,alabama,177,"The hills just east of Wetumpka city centre present the eroded remains of the impact crater that was projected into the rocky substrate, with the area marked by the crater or the Wetumpka astroblem (""star-wound"") due to concentric rings of fractures and areas of broken rocks beneath the surface."

347,0,alabama,347,"The basic document of the Alabama government is the Alabama Constitution, ratified in 1901."
348,0,alabama,348," With nearly 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is, according to some, the longest constitution in the world and represents about 40 times the duration of the United States Constitution."
349,0,alabama,349, There has been an important movement to rewrite and modernize the Alabama Constitution.
350,0,alabama,350," Critics argue that the constitution of Alabama maintains a highly centralized power with the state parliament, leaving virtually no power in local hands."
351,0,alabama,351, Most counties don't have the house rule.
352,0,alabama,352," Any proposed policy change in the various regions of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, often, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353,A criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codifies segregation and racism.
354,0,alabama,354,The Alabama government is divided into three co-equal branches.
355,0,alabama,355," Legislative power is the Legislative Assembly of Alabama, a bicameral assembly composed of the House of Representatives of Alabama, with 105 members, and the Senator of Alabama, with 35 members."
356,0,alabama,356,"The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, adopting or rejecting the legislation of the State."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both chambers of the Legislative Assembly.
358,0,alabama,358,The Legislature has the power to derogate from the veto by a simple majority (most state legislatures need a two-thirds majority to derogate from the veto).
359,0,alabama,359," Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographical basis per county, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360," Since its constitution was adopted in 1901, it has not redistributed Congressional constituencies; therefore, urbanized areas are heavily underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,Nor has it changed the legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses.
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the United States Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one vote"", ruling that Congressional constituencies should be recomposed on the basis of censuses (as the state had already included in its constitution but had not been implemented)."
363,0,alabama,363,"In addition, the Court decided that the two chambers of the legislatures of the bicameral States should be distributed by population, as there was no constitutional basis for States to have geographical systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districts, as many countries had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365, This has led to decades of underinvestment in these areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For example, taxes in Birmingham County and Jefferson had provided a third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of the state's funding."
367,0,alabama,367," Through legislative delegations, the Alabama Legislative Assembly controlled county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive branch is responsible for the enforcement and control of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is headed by the governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370," Other members of the executive branch include the Cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Secretary of State of Alabama, the Treasurer of State of Alabama and the Auditor of State of Alabama."
371,0,alabama,371,The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey.
372,0,alabama,372, Members of Parliament take office immediately after the November elections.
373,0,alabama,373," Government officials, such as the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General and other constitutional agents, took office the following January."
374,0,alabama,374,The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of the State and applying the law in criminal and civil cases.
375,0,alabama,375,The highest court in the state is the Supreme Court of Alabama.
376,0,alabama,376,Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.
377,0,alabama,377," Since the 1980s, judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized."
378,0,alabama,378,The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All judges in the Supreme Court of Alabama are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380," There are two intermediate courts of appeal, the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal, and four courts of first instance: the Circuit Court (court of first instance of general jurisdiction) and the District, Provincial and Municipal Courts."
381,0,alabama,381, Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an extremely high rate of execution.
382,0,alabama,382,Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In a few years, it imposes more death sentences than Texas, a state that has a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384," However, per capita executions are much higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385, Some of his cases have been the subject of intense controversy.
386,0,alabama,386,It was the only State to allow judges to disregard jury decisions when deciding whether or not to apply the death penalty.
387,0,alabama,387, This judicial authority was withdrawn in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,Taxes are collected by the Alabama Ministry of Revenue.
389,0,alabama,389,"Alabama collects a tax of 2, 4, or 5% on personal income, depending on the amount earned and production status."
390,0,alabama,390," Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their tax from the state of Alabama, even if they take the standard deduction; those who list it can also deduct the FICA (social security and health insurance tax)."
391,0,alabama,391,The general rate of the State sales tax is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392,City and county sales tax rates are also added to purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a dinner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"In 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 51 per cent of all government and local revenues, compared with an average of about 36 per cent in the country as a whole."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of the seven states that levy a food tax at the same rate as other goods, and one of the two states (the other being the neighbouring Mississippi) that completely taxes the grocery store without any compensation for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most states exempt food products from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on working poor families is one of the highest in the United States, Alabama, the only state to levy income tax on a family of four people whose income does not exceed $4,600, barely a quarter of the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,The Alabama threshold is lowest among the 41 states and the Columbia District with income taxes.
399,0,alabama,399,The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400," Overall, the federal, state and local tax burden in Alabama places the state as the second lowest tax burden in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Property taxes are the lowest in the United States.
402,0,alabama,402,The current state constitution requires an electoral referendum to increase property tax.
403,0,alabama,403," Since Alabama's tax structure is largely dependent on consumer spending, it is subject to a variable and high budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit of $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405,The Alabama has 67 counties.
406,0,alabama,406," Each county has its own elected legislative branch, generally referred to as the county commission."
407,0,alabama,407,It also has limited executive powers in the county.
408,0,alabama,408," Due to the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power within the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby and Tuscaloosa) of the state have a limited domestic regime."
409,0,alabama,409," Instead, most state counties must press the local Legislative Committee of the State Legislative Assembly for approval of simple local policies, ranging from waste disposal to land-use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The State Legislative Assembly retained power over local governments by refusing to adopt a constitutional amendment establishing the internal system of counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission."
411,0,alabama,411, Legislative delegations retain certain powers with respect to each county.
412,0,alabama,412,"In Baker v. Carr (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court demanded that both houses have population-based districts and redistributed after each census in order to apply the principle of ""one man, one voice""."
413,0,alabama,413," Before that, each county was represented by a state senator, resulting in under-representation in the state senate for the more urbanized and populated counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had failed to redistribute seats in the state house, affected politics well before the 20th century, not recognizing the growth of industrial cities and urbanized areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The lack of a domestic regime for Alabama counties has led to the proliferation of local legislation allowing counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution."
416,0,alabama,416,"The constitution of Alabama has been amended more than 700 times, and nearly one third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to a single county or city."
417,0,alabama,417,"A significant part of each legislative session is devoted to local legislation, taking time and attention from legislators on matters of importance at the state level."""
418,0,alabama,418,"Alabama is a state that controls alcoholic beverages, which means that the state government has a monopoly on the sale of alcohol."
419,0,alabama,419,The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the State.
420,0,alabama,420,"A total of 25 of the 67 counties are ""dry counties"" that prohibit the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in the counties that allow sales of alcohol."
421,0,alabama,421," During the reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops in the third military district under the leadership of General John Pope."
422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as Redemptors took control of the republican state government, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423," After 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to separate and dissociate African-American residents, a process completed in the provisions of the 1901 constitution."
424,0,alabama,424, Provisions that deprive blacks of their right to vote have led to the exclusion of many poor whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"In 1941, more whites than blacks had been deprived of their rights: 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total effects have been greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens have been deprived of their rights and relegated to separate and unequal treatment according to the law."
427,0,alabama,427," From 1901 to 1960, the state did not redraw electoral districts as the population grew and moved within the state during the urbanization and industrialization of certain regions."
428,0,alabama,428,"As the counties were at the base of the electoral districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics for almost three quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases had to be redistributed in 1972 to be represented on an equal footing."
429,0,alabama,429,"The policy of the state of Alabama received national and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, while the whites, bureaucraticly and sometimes violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."
430,0,alabama,430," Governor George Wallace, the only Governor of four state mandates, was a controversial figure who promised to maintain segregation."
431,0,alabama,431,"It was only after the adoption of the 1964 Federal Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act that African Americans regained the capacity to vote, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many countries, they continued to be excluded from representation through general electoral systems, allowing the majority of the population to dominate the elections."
433,0,alabama,433, Some changes have taken place at the county level as a result of judicial challenges aimed at creating single-member districts that allow for more diverse representation among county councils.
434,0,alabama,434,"In 2007, the Alabama Legislature voted, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing ""deep regret"" about slavery and its continuing impact."

438,0,alabama,438," With the downgrading of the Blacks in 1901, the state became an integral part of the ""Solid South"", a system in which the Democratic Party functioned as the only viable political party in every southern state."
439,0,alabama,439,"For almost a hundred years, local elections and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with usually only symbolic Republican contestants running for general elections."

454,0,alabama,454," Many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats, which has led to local elections in the democratic primary."

699,1,alaska,699, Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by region and the tenth richest country (income per capita).
700,1,alaska,700,"In November 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%.In 2018, it was one of the 14 U.S. states that still had only one telephone area code."
701,1,alaska,701," According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Alaska had 710,231 inhabitants."
702,1,alaska,702,"In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.1% non-Hispanic whites), 14.8% Alaska Natives, 5.4% Asians, 3.3% Blacks or African Americans, 1.0% Hawaii Natives and other Pacific Islanders, 1.6% other races and 7.3% two or more races."
703,1,alaska,703, Hispanics or Latinos of any race accounted for 5.5% of the population.
704,1,alaska,704,"In 2011, 50.7 per cent of the Alaskan population under one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., she did not have two non-Hispanic white parents)."
705,1,alaska,705," According to the 2011 American Community Survey, 83.4% of people over five years of age spoke only English at home."
706,1,alaska,706," About 3.5% spoke Spanish at home, 2.2% spoke another Indo-European language, about 4.3% spoke an Asian language (including Tagalog) and about 5.3% spoke other languages at home."
707,1,alaska,707,The Alaska Native Language Centre at the University of Alaska Fairbanks states that there are at least 20 native languages in Alaska and that there are also some languages with different dialects.
708,1,alaska,708," Most of Alaska's Aboriginal languages belong either to Eskimo-Aleut language families or to na-dene language families; however, some languages are considered to be isolates (e.g.:"

711,1,alaska,711,"In 2014, almost all of Alaska's native languages were classified as threatened, changing, moribund, almost extinct or dormant languages."
712,1,alaska,712,"In total, 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the 20 native languages of the state, known locally as ""indigenous languages""."
713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill stating that the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state have official status."
714,1,alaska,714," This bill has given them symbolic recognition as official languages, even if they have not been passed for official purposes within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages in the bill are as follows:
716,1,alaska,716," According to statistics collected by the 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives, approximately 34% of Alaskans were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people were identified as evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholics and 32,550 as main line Protestants."
718,1,alaska,718," About 4% are Mormons, 0.5% are Jewish, 1% are Muslim, 0.5% are Buddhist, 0.2% are Bahá'ís and 0.5% are Hindu."
719,1,alaska,719,"The largest religious denominations in Alaska in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents, non-denominational evangelical Protestants with 38,070 adherents, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Days Saints with 32,170 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents."
720,1,alaska,720," Alaska has been identified, along with the Pacific Pacific States Washington and Oregon, as the least religious states in the United States, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,"In 1795, the first Russian Orthodox Church was founded in Kodiak."
722,1,alaska,722, Marriage with Alaskan natives helped Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches have gradually settled in Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724, Alaska also has the largest population of Quaker (as a percentage) in any state.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for which Halakha's compliance could pose particular problems)."
726,1,alaska,726,"The Hindus of Alaska often share places and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, the Hindus of Alaska established the Sri Gansha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu temple in Alaska and the most northern Hindu temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728,"It is estimated that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Hindus in Alaska."
729,1,alaska,729,The vast majority of Hindus live in Anchorage or Fairbanks.
730,1,alaska,730," Estimates of the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000."
731,1,alaska,731,"In the late 1990s, the Anchorage Islamic Community Centre began building a mosque in Anchorage."
732,1,alaska,732, They opened the ground on a building in southern Anchorage in 2010 and were almost finished by the end of 2014.
733,1,alaska,733," Once completed, the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world."
734,1,alaska,734, There is also a Bahá'í centre.
735,1,alaska,735,"2018's gross domestic product was $55 billion, the country's 48th largest."
736,1,alaska,736,"Her personal income per capita in 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the country."
737,1,alaska,737," According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 per cent."
738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the government's revenues from oil extraction."
739,1,alaska,739," Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is sea fish, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture accounts for a very small portion of Alaska's economy.
741,1,alaska,741," Agricultural production is mainly intended for consumption within the State and includes nurseries, dairy products, vegetables and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742," Manufacturing is limited, with most food and general goods imported from other countries."
743,1,alaska,743," Employment mainly affects government and industries such as natural resource extraction, marine transportation and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744," Military bases are an important part of the economy of Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island, and Kodiak."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746," Its industrial outputs are crude oil, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other extractive industries, seafood processing, wood and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747, There is also an expanding service and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748, Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local accommodation.
749,1,alaska,749," Alaska has significant energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted."
750,1,alaska,750," Significant oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, in February 2014, Alaska had ranked fourth in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota and California."
751,1,alaska,751," Prudhoe Bay on the northern slope of Alaska is still the second-high-yield oil field in the United States, generally producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although at the beginning of 2014, the North Dakota Bakken Formation produced more than 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752," Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil deposit ever found in North America, but it was much smaller than the huge Athabasca oil sands deposit in Canada, which in 2014 produced approximately 1,500 000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of productive reserves at that rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"The Trans-Alaska pipeline can carry and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"In addition, significant coal deposits are found in Alaska's oil, subbituminous, and lignite basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered and technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the northern slope of Alaska."
756,1,alaska,756, Alaska also offers some of the country's highest hydroelectric potential from its many rivers.
757,1,alaska,757,Large stretches of Alaska's coastline also offer wind and geothermal energy potential.
758,1,alaska,758," Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electricity and light."
759,1,alaska,759," Although wind and hydro power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g., wind and hydro power) are not yet fully developed."
760,1,alaska,760,"It was considered uneconomic (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low fuel prices (less than 50¢/gal), long distances and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska is generally thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally much higher, but vary greatly depending on transportation costs, seasonal peaks of use, nearby oil development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is an appropriation authorized by the Constitution of Oil Revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus of the state's oil revenues, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Trans Alaska pipeline network."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the sale of the Prudhoe Bay lease in 1969, for fear that legislators would spend all the proceeds of the sale (i.e. $900 million) at the same time."
764,1,alaska,764,He was later defended by Governor Jay Hammond and State Representative Kenai Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765," This is an attractive political perspective since then, which diverts revenues that would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaskan Constitution has been drafted to discourage the allocation of public funds for specific purposes.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mainly because of the political climate of mistrust that existed at the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768," From its initial capital of $734,000, the fund increased to $50 billion due to oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769, Most if not all capital is invested conservatively outside Alaska.
770,1,alaska,770," This has led to frequent calls from Alaskan politicians for the Fund to invest in Alaska, although such a position has never grown."
771,1,alaska,771," Beginning in 1982, dividends from the annual growth of the fund were paid each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial amount of $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years of payment, since the distribution of payments was suspended in a distribution plan proceeding) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time amount of $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772," Each year, the state legislature withdraws 8% of the gains, gives 3% to the capital for proof of inflation, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all eligible Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To be eligible for the dividend of the Permanent Fund, one must have lived in the State for a minimum of 12 months, maintain permanent residence subject to authorized absences and not be subject to judicial judgements or criminal convictions that fall within various categories of exclusion or may subject the amount of the payment to civil arrest."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often seen as one of the main examples of a ""basic income"" policy in the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the 48 contiguous states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal government officials, particularly U.S. Postal Service (USPS) workers and active service members, receive a subsistence allowance usually set at 25 per cent of basic pay because, although the cost of living has decreased, it remains one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to relatively limited transportation infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778," Because of the northern climate and the short growing season, there is relatively little agriculture in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779," Most farms are located either in the Matanuska Valley, about 64 km northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 97 km southwest of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons."
781,1,alaska,781,"The main crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce and cabbage."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another remarkable agricultural site, particularly the Delta Junction area, about 160 kilometres south-east of Fairbanks, with a large concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms are mainly to the north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783, This region was largely set aside and developed under a state programme led by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784, Crops in the delta region consist mainly of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"To the west of Fairbanks is another concentration of small farms that deal with restaurants, the hotel and tourism industry, and community-supported agriculture."
786,1,alaska,786,"In recent years, Alaskan agriculture has experienced strong growth in market gardeners, small farms and agricultural markets, with the largest percentage increase (46%) in agricultural market growth in the country in 2011, compared to 17% in the country as a whole."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also grown, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a supply gap elsewhere in the world, filling a niche in the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788," Alaska, without counties, has no county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789," However, a small assortment of state fairs and local fairs (with Alaska's largest state fair in Palmer) are held mainly in late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"Fairs are primarily located in communities with historical or current agricultural activity, and include local farmers who exhibit products in addition to more publicized commercial activities such as carnival walks, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792," Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the main Bering Sea and North Pacific fisheries."
793,1,alaska,793,Sea fish is one of the few food products that is often cheaper within the state than outside.
794,1,alaska,794," Many Alaskans take advantage of the salmon season to harvest portions of their domestic diet while fishing for their livelihood, as well as for sport."
795,1,alaska,795," This includes fish caught by hook, net or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Subsistence hunting, mainly caribou, moose and Dall sheep, is still common in the state, particularly in the remote communities of Bush."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of traditional indigenous diet is Akutaq, the Eskimo Ice Cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798," Alaska reindeer farming focuses on the Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with domestic reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799," Most food in Alaska is transported to the state from ""outside,"" and shipping costs make food relatively expensive in cities."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, hunting and subsistence gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitive."
801,1,alaska,801," Although most of the small towns and villages in Alaska are along the coast, the cost of importing food into remote villages can be high due to terrain and difficult road conditions, which change significantly due to climate change and precipitation."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transportation can reach up to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult periods, if these locations can be reached at all during these adverse weather and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering an American gallon of milk (3.8 L) is approximately $3.50 in many villages with a per capita income of $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"The cost of fuel per gallon is consistently 20 to 30 cents higher than the United States' contiguous average, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805, Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the United States.
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road network covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centres and the Alaska Highway, Canada's main exit route from the state."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a motor ferry; for decades this has sparked the debate about moving from the capital to a city on the road network, or the construction of a road link from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,The western part of Alaska has no road network linking communities to the rest of Alaska.
809,1,alaska,809,The interstate highways in Alaska consist of a total of 1082 miles.
810,1,alaska,810,"One of the unique features of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an Alaskan railway tunnel in operation recently renovated to provide asphalt road connections to the isolated community of Whittier, Prince William Sound, to Seward Road, approximately 80 km southeast of Anchorage, Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 4.0 km, the tunnel is the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812, This tunnel is the longest road and rail tunnel in North America.
813,1,alaska,813," Built around 1915, the Alaskan Railway (ARR) plays a key role in the development of Alaska up to the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It connects North Pacific vessels by providing critical infrastructure with routes from Seward to the interior of Alaska through south-central Alaska, through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and the North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815," Cities, villages and the area served by the ARR are known throughout the State as the ""Rail Belt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the continuous improvement of the paved road network has begun to overshadow the importance of the railway to the Alaskan economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railway played a key role in Alaska's development, moving freight to Alaska while transporting natural resources south, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy at Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,He is well known for his summer excursion service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaska Railway was one of the last railways in North America to use cabbages in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last stopping roads of the flag of the country.
821,1,alaska,821,A section of about 100 kilometres of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road
822,1,alaska,822," Until the park road was built in the 1970s, the railway provided the only land access to most of the area along its entire route."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northeastern Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Highway also partly crosses the state from Skagway northward to Canada (British Columbia and Yukon), crossing the border at the White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824," This line is now used mainly by tourists, often arriving by cruise ship to Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was featured in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways.
826,1,alaska,826,The Alaska Rail network is not externally connected.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The closest link to the North American rail system is the northwestern terminus of Canada's national railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska and Canada, and the 48 minus."
829,1,alaska,829, Some private companies provide float service between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830," Many cities, towns and villages in the State do not have access to the road or highway; the only modes of access are by air, river or sea."
831,1,alaska,831," Alaska's well-developed ferry network (called the Alaska Highway) serves the cities of the southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832, Ferries carry vehicles and passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The network also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada via the inland passage to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important maritime link for many communities in the Southeast Prince of Wales area and works with Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summer tourism market, mainly linking northwestern Pacific to southeastern Alaska and, to a lesser extent, cities along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska."
836,1,alaska,836,"The population of Ketchikan, for example, fluctuates considerably over many days – up to four large cruise ships can moor at the same time."
837,1,alaska,837," Cities not served by road, sea or river can only be reached by air, foot, dog sled or snow machine, representing Alaska's highly developed bush air services, a novelty in Alaska."
838,1,alaska,838,"Anchorage and, to a lesser extent, Fairbanks are served by many large airlines."
839,1,alaska,839," Due to limited access to the road, air transport remains the most efficient form of transport within and outside the State."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed extensive renovation and construction work at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012-13, Alaska welcomed nearly two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841," Regular flights to most commercially viable villages and cities in the state are difficult to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government as part of the essential air services program."
842,1,alaska,842," Alaska Airlines is the only major airline to offer jet flights in the state (sometimes in combination with Boeing 737-400 cargo and passengers) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional centres such as Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak and other large communities, as well as major communities in the southeast and the Alaska Peninsula."
843,1,alaska,843," Most of the remaining commercial flights come from small regional suburban companies such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"Smaller towns and villages have to rely on regular or chartered bush flights using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845," Much of this service can be attributed to Alaska's mail bypass program, which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to rural Alaskan communities."
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires that 70% of this subsidy be paid to carriers that provide passenger transportation services to communities.
847,1,alaska,847, Many communities have small air taxi services.
848,1,alaska,848, These operations are the result of demand for personalized transportation to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849, Perhaps the most quintessence aircraft in Alaska is the bush seaplane.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights to remote villages without airstrips carry passengers, freight and many items from stores and warehouse clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,"In 2006, Alaska had the largest number of pilots per capita in all U.S. states."
852,1,alaska,852, Another means of transportation from Alaska is the dog sled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (i.e. at any time after the mid-1920s), dog mushing is more a sport than a means of transportation."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are organized around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod sled dog race, a trail of 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum race in Nome in which moshers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicines very necessary to the diphtheria community of Nome when all the other means of transport had failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage every March to fight for money, prizes and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that follows more precisely the route of the famous relay of 1925, starting from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) in Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by off-road vehicle and winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as is commonly known in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859,The Internet and other data transport systems in Alaska are largely provided by the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and, at the end of 2011, Alaska Communications announced that it has ""two fibre optic paths to the 48 minus and two more across Alaska."
861,1,alaska,861,"In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to link Asia and the rural areas of Alaska was planned, partly supported by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government."
862,1,alaska,862," Like all other American states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive power composed of the Governor of Alaska and his appointed persons who are head of executive departments; a legislative power composed of the House of Representatives of Alaska and Senators of Alaska; and a judicial power composed of the Supreme Court of Alaska and the lower courts."

2523,5,colorado,2523," Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado."
2524,5,colorado,2524," Most of Colorado consists of mountains, foothills, high plains and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,The surrounding mountains and valleys have a major impact on the local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a general rule, an increase in altitude leads to a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeastern, eastern and southeastern Colorado are mainly the high plains, while northern Colorado is a mixture of high plains, foothills and mountains."
2528,5,colorado,2528,"The northwest and west of Colorado are mostly mountainous, with some mixed desert lands."

2530,5,colorado,2530,"The climate of the eastern plains is semi-arid (Köppen climate classification: BSk) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually 15 to 25 inches (380 to 640 millimetres) per year."
2531,5,colorado,2531,"The region is known for its abundant sun and cool and light nights, which gives this region a large range of average daytime temperature."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable since the heat dissipates in the space during the clear nights, since the thermal radiation is not trapped by the clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, home to most of Colorado's population, is in a shadow of precipitation due to its presence on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this region may have several days above 95°F (35°C) and often 100°F (38°C)."
2535,5,colorado,2535,"In the plains, winter hollows usually range from 25 to -10°F (−4 to -23°C)."
2536,5,colorado,2536," Approximately 75% of precipitation falls during the growing season, from April to September, but this region is highly prone to drought."
2537,5,colorado,2537," Most precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and major snowstorms that occur in winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538," Otherwise, winters tend to be more or less dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,"In most of the region, Mars is the most snowy month."
2540,5,colorado,2540,"April and May are normally the wettest months, while April is the wettest month overall."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"The cities of Front Range closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in winter due to the Chinook wind that warms the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70°F (21°C) or higher in winter."
2542,5,colorado,2542,The mean July temperature is 55°F (13°C) in the morning and 90°F (32°C) in the afternoon.
2543,5,colorado,2543,"The mean January temperature is 18°F (−8°C) in the morning and 48°F (9°C) in the afternoon, although the variations between consecutive days may be 40°F (20°C)."
2544,5,colorado,2544," Just west of the plains and in the foothills, there is a wide variety of climate types."
2545,5,colorado,2545, Locations a few kilometres apart may experience a completely different time depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546," Most valleys have a semi-arid climate that is no different from the eastern plains, which moves to an alpine climate at the highest altitudes."
2547,5,colorado,2547,"Microclimates also exist in local areas that cover almost the full range of climates, including subtropical highlands (Cfb/Cwb), wet subtropicals (Cfa), wet continentals (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterraneans (Csa/Csb) and subarctics (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548," Extreme climate change is common in Colorado, although a significant part of the extreme weather conditions occur in the least populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549,"Thunderstorms are common east of the continental ditch in spring and summer, but are usually short."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"Hail is a common view in the mountains east of Divide and across the eastern plains, especially the northeastern part of the state."
2551,5,colorado,2551,"Hail is the most commonly reported serious weather hazard for the warm season and occasionally causes human injury, as well as significant material damage."
2552,5,colorado,2552,The eastern plains are subject to some of the largest hailstorms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553," Examples include the violent hailstorms that struck Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the most costly in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The eastern plains are part of the extreme west of the Tornado gangway; some harmful tornadoes on the eastern plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town in 2008."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern plains see particularly frequent tornadoes, whether from mesocyclones in supercell storms or from less intense lands, such as the Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,"The plains are also exposed to occasional flooding and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused by both thunderstorms and the rapid melting of snow in the mountains in warm weather."
2557,5,colorado,2557,"Notable examples include the Denver flood in 1965, the Big Thompson flood in 1976 and the Colorado flood in 2013."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common in the summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's record in 1901 for consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken in the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record of almost a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561," Most of Colorado is very dry, with the average condition of only 17 inches (430 millimetres) of precipitation per year on a state-wide basis."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely experiences a time when part of it is not to some extent drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563,"The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of forest fires in the state, such as the Hayman fire in 2002."
2564,5,colorado,2564," Other notable fires include the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, the Waldo Canyon Fire and the June 2012 High Park Fire, and the June 2013 Black Forest Fire."
2565,5,colorado,2565," Even these fires were overtaken by the pine mulch fire, the Cameron Peak fire, and the Eastern Troublefire in 2020, which are the three largest fires in Colorado history (see Colorado Forest Fires in 2020)."
2566,5,colorado,2566," However, some of Colorado's mountainous regions receive a large amount of moisture from winter snowfall."
2567,5,colorado,2567,"The spring melt of these snows often causes large flows of water in the Yampa River, Colorado River, Rio Grande, Arkansas, North Platte River and South Platte River."
2568,5,colorado,2568,"Water flowing from the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very important source of water for farms, cities and cities in southwestern New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada, as well as for the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas."
2569,5,colorado,2569,A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; sometimes (formerly naturally and regularly) water flows reach northern Mexico.
2570,5,colorado,2570,"The highest ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115°F (46.1°C) on July 20, 2019, at the John Martin Dam."
2571,5,colorado,2571,The lowest official air temperature was −61°F (−51.7°C) on 1 February 1985 at Maybell.
2572,5,colorado,2572," Despite its mountainous reliefs, Colorado is relatively calm from the seismic point of view."
2573,5,colorado,2573,The U.S. National Earthquake Information Centre is located in Golden.

3358,7,delaware,3358,The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual.
3359,7,delaware,3359, Most of the border between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by a 12-mile arch (19.3 km) of the dome of the courthouse in the city of New Castle.
3360,7,delaware,3360, This limit is often referred to as the circle of the Twelve-Mile.
3361,7,delaware,3361," Although the circle of twelve miles is often considered the only territorial border in the United States that is a true arc, the Mexican border with Texas includes several arches, and many southern cities (such as the plains, Georgia) also have circular borders."

3371,7,delaware,3371," Since almost all of Delaware is part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate."

3383,7,delaware,3383," Before Delaware was colonized by European settlers, the area housed the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mainly along the coast, and the Nanticokes who occupied much of the southern Delmarva Peninsula."
3384,7,delaware,3384,"John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of Nanticoke – they may have kept small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating to Chesapeake Bay."
3385,7,delaware,3385,The Kuskarawocks were most likely the Tuscarora.
3386,7,delaware,3386,The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to the Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River.
3387,7,delaware,3387," They had an established hunting and farming society, and they quickly became intermediaries in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their former enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock."
3388,7,delaware,3388," With the loss of their land on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wanted to remain identified as such left the region and moved to the Alleghany Mountains in the mid-18th century."
3389,7,delaware,3389," Generally, those who did not move out of Delaware's state were baptized, became Christians and were regrouped with other colored people in official documents and in the minds of their non-Aboriginal American neighbours."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the current Delaware in the Middle Region by establishing a trading post in Zwaanendael, near the Lewes site in 1631."
3391,7,delaware,3391,"In less than a year, all settlers were killed in an argument with the Amerindian tribes of the region."
3392,7,delaware,3392,"In 1638, a new Sweden, a trading post and a Swedish colony, was founded in Fort Christina (now Wilmington) by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch."
3393,7,delaware,3393,The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years.
3394,7,delaware,3394,"In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leaders of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at the present time New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the colony of New Sweden, annexing it to the Netherlands New Land."
3395,7,delaware,3395," Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York."
3396,7,delaware,3396," Combating an earlier claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, owner of Maryland, the Duke passed on his somewhat doubtful property to William Penn in 1682."
3397,7,delaware,3397,"Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his province of Pennsylvania and praised what was then called the Duke's ""Low Counties on Delaware""."

3399,7,delaware,3399," However, in 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had become so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the consent of the lower counties, and the two groups of representatives began to meet alone, one in Philadelphia, and the other in New Castle."

4272,9,georgia,4272," They accounted for 46.7 per cent of the population of the State in 1900, but the proportion of the population of Georgia that was African-American then fell to 28 per cent, mainly due to tens of thousands of people leaving the State during the Great Migration."
4273,9,georgia,4273," According to the 2015 report of the Equal Justice Institute on lynching in the United States (1877-1950), Georgia killed 531, the second largest total of extrajudicial executions in any southern state."
4274,9,georgia,4274, Most of the victims were blacks and men.
4275,9,georgia,4275," Political exclusion persisted in the mid-1960s, until the Congress passed the Voting Rights Act 1965."
4276,9,georgia,4276,"A Baptist minister born in Atlanta who was part of the educated middle class that had developed in the African-American community of Atlanta, Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as a national leader in the civil rights movement."

4278,9,georgia,4278,"On 5 February 1958, during a training mission led by a B-47, a Mark 15 nuclear bomb, also known as the Tybee bomb, was lost off Tybee Island near Savannah."

4280,9,georgia,4280,"In the 1960s, the proportion of African-Americans in Georgia had fallen to 28 per cent of the population of the state, after waves of migration to the north and some emigration by whites."

4284,9,georgia,4284,"Ralph McGill, chief editor and union columnist of the Atlanta Constitution, gained admiration by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement."
4285,9,georgia,4285,"In 1970, newly elected governor Jimmy Carter declared in his inaugural speech that the era of racial segregation had ended."
4286,9,georgia,4286,"In 1972, Georgians elected Andrew Young to Congress as the first African-American MP since the reconstruction era."
4287,9,georgia,4287,"In 1980, the expansion of Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL) was completed."
4288,9,georgia,4288,"The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than 100 million passengers per year."
4289,9,georgia,4289," With more than 60,000 employees, the airport has become a major driver of economic growth."
4290,9,georgia,4290," With the benefits of cheap real estate, low taxes, the right to work and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, the Atlanta metropolitan area has become a national centre for finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, logistics and transportation, as well as film, convention and trade show companies."
4291,9,georgia,4291,"In 1990, the International Olympic Committee chose Atlanta as its seat for the 1996 Summer Olympics."

4293,9,georgia,4293,"In 1992, construction was completed on Bank of America Plaza, the tallest building in the United States outside New York or Chicago."
4294,9,georgia,4294," From the Atlantic Ocean, the eastern border of the state with South Carolina goes up the Savannah River from the northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Senatorca rivers."
4295,9,georgia,4295,"It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and in the Chattooga River, its most important tributary."
4296,9,georgia,4296, These limits were determined in the Treaty of Beaufort of 1797 and tested in the Supreme Court of the United States in both Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989.
4297,9,georgia,4297,"The boundary then turns abruptly around the end of Rabun County at 35° N, although from this point it diverges slightly southward (due to inaccuracies in the initial survey)."
4298,9,georgia,4298," This northern border was originally the border of Georgia and North Carolina to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies prompted the Georgian legislature to pass a law, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell most of Georgia's territory, which currently includes Alabama and Mississippi."
4299,9,georgia,4299,The western boundary of the state extends straight to the southeast from a point southwest of Chattanooga to the Chattahoochee River near West Point.
4300,9,georgia,4300,"It continues downwards to the point where it joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming the Apalachicola River of Florida); the southern border goes almost full east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the St. Mary River, which then forms the rest of the border back to the ocean."
4301,9,georgia,4301,The limits of the water are always fixed to be the thalweg of origin of the rivers.
4302,9,georgia,4302," Since then, many have been flooded by lakes created by dams, including the Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint point now under Seminole Lake."
4303,9,georgia,4303," Georgian legislators have claimed that, during an investigation in 1818, the state border with Tennessee was wrongly placed a mile (1.6 km) further south than expected, and they still contest it."
4304,9,georgia,4304,The correction of this impreciseness would allow Georgia to have access to the water of the Tennessee River.
4305,9,georgia,4305, Each region has its own characteristics.
4306,9,georgia,4306,"For example, the ridge and valley, located in the northwest corner of the state, include limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which produced building limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal."

4319,9,georgia,4319,"Hot and humid summers are characteristic, except at the highest altitudes."
4320,9,georgia,4320,"The whole state, including the mountains of North Georgia, receives moderate to heavy rainfall, ranging from 45 inches (1143 mm) in central Georgia to about 75 inches (1905 mm) around the northeastern part of the state."
4321,9,georgia,4321,"The extent to which the time of a given region of Georgia is subtropical depends on latitude, proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico and altitude."
4322,9,georgia,4322," This latter factor occurs mainly in mountainous areas of the northern part of the state, which are more distant from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level."
4323,9,georgia,4323,The hardiness zones of USDA plants for Georgia range from zone 6b (not colder than −5°F (−21°C)) in Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b (not colder than 15°F (−9°C)) along the Atlantic coast and the Florida border.
4324,9,georgia,4324,"The highest temperature ever recorded was 112°F (44.4°C) at Louisville on 24 July 1952, while the lowest temperature was −17°F (−27.2°C) in northern Floyd County on 27 January 1940."
4325,9,georgia,4325," Georgia is one of the main states at the frequency of tornadoes, although they are rarely stronger than EF1."
4326,9,georgia,4326," Although the tornadoes that hit the city are very rare, an EF2 tornado hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings."
4327,9,georgia,4327," With a coast on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare in the 20th century."
4328,9,georgia,4328," Georgia is often hit by hurricanes that hit the Florida Panhandle, weaken on land and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rains inside, a recent example being Hurricane Michael, as well as hurricanes that come near the Georgian coast, brushing the coast on their way north without ever landing."
4329,9,georgia,4329, Hurricane Matthew of 2016 and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 simply did so.
4330,9,georgia,4330, Due to anthropogenic change Georgia's climate is warming.
4331,9,georgia,4331," This situation is already causing major disturbances, for example, due to sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable than many other states because its lands are sinking) and warming will continue."
4332,9,georgia,4332,"The United States Census Bureau estimates that in 2019, Georgia had 10,617,423 inhabitants, an increase of 97,948 over the previous year, and an increase of 929,770 (9.60%) since 2010."
4333,9,georgia,4333," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438,939 (849,414 births minus 410,475 deaths) and an increase from the net migration of 606,673 people in the state."
4334,9,georgia,4334,"Immigration has resulted in a net increase of 228,415 persons, and internal migration has resulted in a net increase of 378,258 persons."
4335,9,georgia,4335,"In 2010, the number of illegal immigrants living in Georgia more than doubled to 480,000 between January 2000 and January 2009, according to a federal report."
4336,9,georgia,4336, This has given Georgia the largest percentage increase among the 10 states with the largest populations of illegal immigrants in those years.
4337,9,georgia,4337, Georgia has banned the cities of Sanctuary.

4341,9,georgia,4341, Hispanics and Latinos of all races make up 8.8% of the population.
4342,9,georgia,4342,"In 2011, 58.8% of the Georgian population under one year of age were minorities (i.e., they had at least one non-Hispanic white parent) compared to other states such as California with 75.1%, New York with 55.6% and Texas with 69.8%."
4343,9,georgia,4343,The largest groups of European ancestry are:
4344,9,georgia,4344,"At the 1980 census, 1,584,303 Georgians claimed English ancestry out of a total population of 3,994,817, making it 40 per cent of the state and the largest ethnic group at the time."
4345,9,georgia,4345," Today, many of these same people claiming to be of ""American"" descent are in fact of English origin, and some of them are of Scottish origin; however, their families have been living in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they simply choose to identify themselves as having an ""American"" ancestry or do not actually know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346," Their ancestry mainly dates back to the thirteen colonies of origin and, for this reason, many of them are now content to claim ""American"" ancestry, although they are essentially of English origin."
4347,9,georgia,4347,"In 2004, 7.7 per cent of the Georgian population were under the age of 5, 26.4 per cent under the age of 18 and 9.6 per cent under the age of 65."
4348,9,georgia,4348,"In 2004, women accounted for about 50.6 per cent of the population, while African Americans accounted for about 29.6 per cent."
4349,9,georgia,4349," Historically, about half of Georgia's population was made up of African-Americans who, before the civil war, were almost exclusively slaves."
4350,9,georgia,4350,The large migration of hundreds of thousands of black people from rural south to industrial north between 1914 and 1970 reduced the African-American population.
4351,9,georgia,4351," Georgia experienced the second largest growth of the Asian population in the United States from 1990 to 2000, more than double its size over the 10-year period."
4352,9,georgia,4352,"In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percentage of the total population of Afro-Americans (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and the third in terms of the digital black population after New York and Florida."
4353,9,georgia,4353, Georgia is the third country with the lowest percentage of older persons (65 years of age or older) at 12.8% (in 2015).
4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonization of a large number of Scottish, English-American and Scottish-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmonts, as well as coastal colonization by some English-American and Afro-Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported into coastal areas in the 18th century on several occasions in rice regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the lower African-American countries.
4356,9,georgia,4356," They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture continue more than in other areas."
4357,9,georgia,4357,"In the creolization of the culture of the South, their food routes have become an integral part of all the cuisines of the South in the Lower Country."
4358,9,georgia,4358,"In 2010, 87.35% (7,666,663) of Georgians aged 5 and over spoke English at home as their primary language, while 7.42% (651,583) spoke Spanish, 0.51% (44,702) Korean, 0.44% (38,244) Vietnamese, 0.42% (36,679) French, 0.38% (33,009) Chinese (including Mandarin) and German, which was spoken as their main language by 0.29% (23,351) of the population over the age of 5."
4359,9,georgia,4359,"A total of 12.65% (1 109,888) of Georgians aged 5 and over spoke a mother tongue other than English."
4360,9,georgia,4360," Atlanta, located in the north-central part of Georgia, east of the continental ditch, has been the capital of Georgia since 1868."

4364,9,georgia,4364,"The state has 17 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, according to estimates from the 2019 U.S. census."
4365,9,georgia,4365," Together with the rest of the South-East, the Georgian population continues to grow rapidly, with the main gains concentrated in urban areas."
4366,9,georgia,4366,"The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area increased by 1.23 million people (24%) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta moved from the eleventh metropolitan area of the United States to the ninth."

4368,9,georgia,4368,"Atheists, deists, agnostics and other non-affiliated individuals account for 13% of the population."
4369,9,georgia,4369,"The largest Christian denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,759.317; the Methodist Church united with 619.394; and the Roman Catholic Church with 596.384."

4373,9,georgia,4373,"The Roman Catholic Church is remarkable in the urban areas of Georgia, and includes the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of Savannah."

4376,9,georgia,4376,Chabad and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute are also active in the state.
4377,9,georgia,4377," Like all other American states and the federal government, the Georgian government is based on the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial branches."
4378,9,georgia,4378,"The executive power of the State rests with the Governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republic)."
4379,9,georgia,4379,The Governor of Georgia and the Lieutenant Governor are elected on separate ballot papers for a four-year term.
4380,9,georgia,4380," Unlike the federal government, but like many other American states, most of the executive officials who make up the governor's cabinet are elected by Georgian citizens rather than by the governor."
4381,9,georgia,4381," Legislative power belongs to the General Assembly, composed of the Senator and the House of Representatives."
4382,9,georgia,4382,"The Lieutenant Governor presides over the senator, while members of the House of Representatives choose their own Speaker."
4383,9,georgia,4383,"The Georgian Constitution provides for a maximum of 56 senators, elected in single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives distributed among representative districts (which sometimes translates into more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives."
4384,9,georgia,4384,The term of office of senators and representatives is two years.
4385,9,georgia,4385, Laws adopted by the General Assembly are codified in the Annotated Official Code of Georgia.

4394,9,georgia,4394," Several counties have a single form of commissioner's government, with legislative and executive powers vested in one person."
4395,9,georgia,4395, Georgia is the only State currently home to the counties of Sole Commissioner.
4396,9,georgia,4396,"The Constitution of Georgia confers on all counties and cities the authority of ""domestic domination""."
4397,9,georgia,4397,"The county commissions have considerable power to pass laws within their county, as would a municipality."
4398,9,georgia,4398," Georgia recognizes all local government units as cities, so every incorporated city is legally a city."
4399,9,georgia,4399," Georgia does not provide for cantons or independent cities, although draft laws have been proposed by the Legislative Assembly to provide for cantons; it authorizes consolidated county governments by local referendum."
4400,9,georgia,4400,"All the second-class cities of Georgia, with the exception of Savannah, have now formed by referendum consolidated governments of the Counties: Columbus (in 1970), Athens (1990), Augusta (1995) and Macon (2012)."
4401,9,georgia,4401,(Augusta and Athens excluded one or more small towns within their consolidated boundaries; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all small entities within their consolidated boundaries.)
4402,9,georgia,4402,The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated government of the city-county after merging with the unincorporated County of Chattahoochee in 2003.

4404,9,georgia,4404," There is no real metropolitan government in Georgia, even though the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and the Georgia Regional Transport Administration provide some services, and the CRA must approve all major land use planning projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area."
4405,9,georgia,4405," Georgia voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a series that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020."
4406,9,georgia,4406," Until 1964, the state government of Georgia had the longest record of domination of a single party by the Democratic Party of any state of the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407, This record was largely established because of the exclusion of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws at the beginning of the 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408," Some elements, such as the obligation to pay voting taxes and pass literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted until the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century."
4409,9,georgia,4409,"The White Democrats regained power after the reconstruction in part thanks to the efforts of some who resort to intimidation and violence, but this method has been discredited."
4410,9,georgia,4410,"In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a constitutional amendment in 1908, Blacks made up 47% of the population of the state."
4411,9,georgia,4411,"The Whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment which, in practice, deprived the poor blacks and whites, almost half of the population of the state."
4412,9,georgia,4412,"It required that any man at least 21 years of age wishing to vote: (a) be of good character and be able to pass a citizenship test, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the constitutions of the United States and Georgia, or (c) possess at least 40 acres of land or $500 of property."
4413,9,georgia,4413, Any Georgian who had fought in any war of the American Revolution during the Hispano-American war was exempted from these additional qualifications.
4414,9,georgia,4414," Most importantly, any Georgian descendant of a veteran of one of these wars was also exempt."
4415,9,georgia,4415," Because in 1908 many white men in Georgia were grandsons of veterans and/or possessed the property required, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only white people to vote well."
4416,9,georgia,4416,"Good character qualifications, knowledge of citizenship and literacy (all subjectively determined by white registrars) and property were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering for voting."
4417,9,georgia,4417,The lists of electors have dropped dramatically.
4418,9,georgia,4418,"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Progressive encouraged electoral reform and reduced the power of ward leaders to cleanse politics."
4419,9,georgia,4419," Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to shut down illiterate people."
4420,9,georgia,4420,The rule of the single party has been solidified.
4421,9,georgia,4421,"For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians appointed and elected only white democratic governors, and white democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly."

4691,10,hawaii,4691,The Hawaiian Islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an underwater magma source called the Hawaii Hotspot.
4692,10,hawaii,4692,"The process continues to build islands; the tectonic plate under much of the Pacific Ocean moves continuously to the northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes."
4693,10,hawaii,4693," Due to the location of the hotspot, all currently active terrestrial volcanoes are located in the southern half of Hawaii Island."

4705,10,hawaii,4705," Because the Hawaiian Islands are far from other terrestrial habitats, life is supposed to have reached them by wind, waves (i.e."
4706,10,hawaii,4706,by ocean currents) and wings (i.e.
4707,10,hawaii,4707," birds, insects and seeds they may have worn on their feathers)."
4708,10,hawaii,4708," This isolation, coupled with the diversity of the environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates and dry shores), has allowed the evolution of new endemic flora and fauna."

4714,10,hawaii,4714,The archipelago's main existing islands have been above the ocean's surface for less than 10 million years.
4715,10,hawaii,4715,The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on the high mountains within a windfield.
4716,10,hawaii,4716,"On a single island, the climate around the coast can vary from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres of annual precipitation) to wet tropical; on the slopes, the environments range from rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5100 millimetres per year), to temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold and dry climate."
4717,10,hawaii,4717,"Rainy climate has implications for soil development, which largely determines soil permeability, affecting stream and wetland distribution."

4723,10,hawaii,4723,"The monument covers approximately 140,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls and shallow deep waters up to 80 kilometres off the Pacific Ocean, a larger area than all United States national parks combined."
4724,10,hawaii,4724,"The Hawaiian climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme due to the almost constant trade winds of the East."
4725,10,hawaii,4725,"Summer levels generally reach about 88°F (31°C) during the day, with a low temperature of 75°F (24°C) at night."

4731,10,hawaii,4731,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state, at Pahala on April 27, 1931, is 100°F (38°C), making it bound to Alaska as the lowest record temperature observed in the U.S. state."
4732,10,hawaii,4732,The record low temperature of Hawaii is 12°F (−11°C) observed in May 1979 at the top of Mauna Kea.
4733,10,hawaii,4733, Hawaii is the only state that has ever recorded Fahrenheit subzero temperatures.
4734,10,hawaii,4734," Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into wind and wind zones (ko-olau and kona, respectively) depending on their location relative to the upper mountains."
4735,10,hawaii,4735,Wind side facing cloudy cover.
4736,10,hawaii,4736, Hawaii is one of two states that have been widely recognized as independent nations before joining the United States.
4737,10,hawaii,4737,"The Kingdom of Hawaii was sovereign from 1810 to 1893, when the monarchy was overthrown by capitalists and resident American and European landowners."
4738,10,hawaii,4738," Hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until August 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the United States."
4739,10,hawaii,4739, Hawaii was admitted as an American state on 21 August 1959.
4740,10,hawaii,4740,"On the basis of archaeological evidence, the first habitation in the Hawaiian Islands dates from about 300 AD, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands."
4741,10,hawaii,4741,A second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora took place in the 11th century.
4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of the human discovery and habitat of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of an academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743," Some archaeologists and historians believe that it is a wave of immigrants from Tahiti around 1000 AD that introduced a new line of high leaders, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the construction of heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744, This later immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (mo-olelo) about Pa-ao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745, Other authors say that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a subsequent influx of Tahitian settlers and that Pa'ao must be considered a myth.
4746,10,hawaii,4746,"The history of the islands is marked by slow and steady population growth and the size of the capitals, which has developed to encompass entire islands."
4747,10,hawaii,4747,"The local leaders, called alii, governed their colonies, and waged wars to expand their influence and defend their communities against predatory rivals."
4748,10,hawaii,4748,"The former Hawaii was a caste-based society, much like the Hindu society in India."
4749,10,hawaii,4749,"The arrival in 1778 of the British explorer, Captain James Cook, marked the first documented contact of a European explorer with Hawaii."
4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the archipelago ""Sandwich Islands"" in honour of his sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the location of the islands and making the native name Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form ""Owyhee"" or ""Owhyhee"" is preserved on behalf of certain locations in the U.S. Northwest Pacific, including Owyhee County and the Owyhee Mountains at Idaho, named after three Hawaiian Aboriginal members of a trapping party that has disappeared in the area."
4752,10,hawaii,4752,"It is very possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778."
4753,10,hawaii,4753,"Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano on board as a pilot."
4754,10,hawaii,4754," According to the interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe a meeting with the Hawaiians or the Marshall Islands."

5209,11,idaho,5209, Its origin remains a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the U.S. Congress envisaged organizing a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician who presented himself as an unrecognized delegate of the unofficial Jefferson territory."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a Shoshone term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""the name of the mountains,"" but it was later revealed that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he was inspired to give the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"As the name seemed to be made, the U.S. Congress finally decided to appoint the Colorado Territory region instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time that decision was made, the city of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been appointed according to Willing's proposal."
5213,11,idaho,5213," That same year, Congress established Colorado Territory, a county called Idaho County, in eastern Washington."

5216,11,idaho,5216,"In any event, part of Washington's territory, including Idaho County, was used to create the Idaho Territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217," Finally, the name was given to the Idaho Territory, which later became the American state."
5218,11,idaho,5218," Despite this lack of evidence of the origin of the name, many textbooks well in the 20th century repeated as Willing's account the name ""Idaho"" derived from the term Shoshone ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,An Idaho 1956 history manual says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"An alternative to etymology attributes the name to the Plains Apache word ""ídaahęγ"" IPA: [í.ta=.h=] (enemy) which was used in reference to the Comanche."

5273,11,idaho,5273,"The first non-Aboriginal colony was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Pend Oreille Lake for the fur trade in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company."
5274,11,idaho,5274,"In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, then working for the Pacific Fur Company, established a position on the lower Clearwater River near Lewiston today."
5275,11,idaho,5275," This position, called ""MacKenzie's Post"" or ""Clearwater"", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was purchased by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned."
5276,11,idaho,5276,"The first attempts by organized communities, within the current borders of Idaho, were put in place in 1860."
5277,11,idaho,5277,The first permanent and incorporated community was Lewiston in 1861.
5278,11,idaho,5278," After some tribulations as a territory, including the chaotic transfer from the territorial capital of Lewiston to Boise, the abandonment of the right to vote of the Mormonist polygamists supported by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, and a federal attempt to divide the territory between the territory of Washington which obtained state status in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho attained state status in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,Idaho was one of the hardest hit by the Pacific Northwest States during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280," Prices fell for the main Idaho crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes brought only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income fall from $686 in 1929 to $250 in 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a state of tourism and agriculture to include science and technology industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest economic centre (more than 25 per cent of total government revenue) within the State and are larger than agriculture, forestry and mining combined."
5283,11,idaho,5283,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Idaho population was 1,787,065 as of July 1, 2018, an increase of 14% since 2010."
5284,11,idaho,5284,"The Idaho population was estimated at 1,754,208 in 2018, an increase of 37,265 over the previous year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010."
5285,11,idaho,5285," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to the net migration of 75,795 people to the State."
5286,11,idaho,5286, There are many Americans of English and German origin in Idaho.
5287,11,idaho,5287,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people and internal migration resulted in a net increase of 61,273 people."
5288,11,idaho,5288,"For example, Idaho is the tenth fastest growing state after the District of Columbia (+16.74%), Utah (+14.37%), Texas (+14.14%), Florida (+13.29%), Colorado (+13.25%), North Dakota (+13.01 %), Nevada (+12.36%), Arizona (+12.20%) and Washington."
5289,11,idaho,5289," From 2017 to 2018, Idaho was the second fastest, surpassed only by Nevada."
5290,11,idaho,5290,"Nampa, about 30 km west of downtown Boise, became the second largest city in the state in the late 1990s, passing through Pocatello and Idaho Falls."
5291,11,idaho,5291,"The population of Nampa was less than 29,000 in 1990 and had increased to more than 81,000 in 2010."
5292,11,idaho,5292," Located between Nampa and Boise, Meridian has also experienced strong growth, from less than 10,000 residents in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now the third largest city in Idaho."
5293,11,idaho,5293," Growth of 5% or more over the same period was also observed in Caldwell, Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls and Twin Falls."
5294,11,idaho,5294," From 1990 to 2010, the Idaho population increased by more than 560,000 (55%)."
5295,11,idaho,5295,"The metropolitan area of Boise (officially known as Boise City-Nampa, Metropolitan Statistics Region ID) is the largest metropolitan area of Idaho."
5296,11,idaho,5296,"The other metropolitan areas in order of size are Heart of Alène, Idaho Falls, Pocatello and Lewiston."
5297,11,idaho,5297,The table below shows the racial composition of the Idaho population from 2016.
5298,11,idaho,5298," According to the 2017 U.S. Community Survey, 12.2% of the Idaho population were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (10.6%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.1%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (1.3%)."
5299,11,idaho,5299,"The five largest ancestry groups are German (17.5%), English (16.4%), Irish (9.3%), American (8.1%) and Scots (3.2%)."
5300,11,idaho,5300,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnic origin and race, giving a higher overall number."
5301,11,idaho,5301," According to the Pew Research Center on Religion & Public Life, the self-identified religious affiliations of Idahoans over the age of 18 in 2008 and 2014 were:"
5302,11,idaho,5302," According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest denominations according to the number of members in 2010 were the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last-Day Saints with 409 265, the Catholic Church with 123 400, the Evangelical Protestant with 62 637, and the Assemblies of God with 22,183."

5306,11,idaho,5306,Idaho is an important agricultural state that produces nearly a third of the potatoes grown in the United States.
5307,11,idaho,5307,"The three varieties of wheat, dark northern spring, hard red, and soft white are grown in the state."
5308,11,idaho,5308,The County of Nez Perce is considered a soft white growth site of first order.
5309,11,idaho,5309,"Idaho's main industries are food processing, lumber and wood products, machinery, chemicals, paper products, electronic manufacturing, silver and other extractive industries, and tourism."
5310,11,idaho,5310,"The largest factory in the world for barrel cheese, the raw product for processed cheese is in Gooding, Idaho."
5311,11,idaho,5311,"It has a capacity of 120,000 metric tonnes per year of cheese in barrels and belongs to the Glanbia group."
5312,11,idaho,5312,The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is the largest facility in the country's energy department by region.
5313,11,idaho,5313,INL is an important part of Idaho's eastern economy.
5314,11,idaho,5314,Idaho also houses three facilities in Anheuser-Busch that provide much malt for breweries across the country.
5315,11,idaho,5315,A wide range of industries are important.
5316,11,idaho,5316," Outdoor recreation is a common example, ranging from many snowmobile, downhill and cross-country ski resorts in winter to Lewiston's evolution as a retreat community based on mild winters, a dry and year-round climate and one of the lowest mid-wind speeds everywhere, combined with rivers for a wide variety of activities."
5317,11,idaho,5317," Other examples would be ATK, which operates three ammunition and ammunition components plants in Lewiston."
5318,11,idaho,5318, Two are sports and one is a defense contract.

5323,11,idaho,5323," Today, Idaho's largest industry is the science and technology sector."
5324,11,idaho,5324,It accounts for more than 25 per cent of government revenues and more than 70 per cent of government exports.
5325,11,idaho,5325,"The industrial economy of Idaho is developing, with high-tech products in mind."
5326,11,idaho,5326," Since the late 1970s, Boise has become a centre for semiconductor production."
5327,11,idaho,5327,"Boise is the home of Micron Technology, the only American manufacturer of dynamic random access chips (DRAM)."
5328,11,idaho,5328,"Micron both made desktop computers, but with very limited success."
5329,11,idaho,5329,"Hewlett-Packard has operated a large plant in Boise since the 1970s, mainly dedicated to the production of LaserJet printers."

5337,11,idaho,5337,"In 2014, Idaho became the second most favourable state for small businesses, ranking behind Utah, based on data from more than 12,000 small business owners."
5338,11,idaho,5338,Idaho has a gambling lottery that provided $333.5 million to all public schools and higher education in Idaho from 1990 to 2006.
5339,11,idaho,5339,The tax is collected by the State Tax Commission of Idaho.
5340,11,idaho,5340,Public personal income tax varies from 1.6% to 7.8% across eight income brackets.
5341,11,idaho,5341,"Idahoans may claim State tax credits for taxes paid to other States, as well as for donations to educational entities in the State of Idaho and to certain non-profit educational and rehabilitation institutions for young people."
5342,11,idaho,5342,The public sales tax is 6% with a very limited and selective local option up to 6.5%.
5343,11,idaho,5343," Sales tax applies to the sale, rental or rental of tangible personal property and certain services."

5346,11,idaho,5346, Some jurisdictions impose a tax on sales of local options.
5347,11,idaho,5347," Sales tax was introduced at 3% in 1965, easily approved by voters, where it remained at 3% until 1983."
5348,11,idaho,5348,"In 2017, Idaho's primary energy source was hydropower, and energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatt hours (MWh)."
5349,11,idaho,5349,"In 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market, with the Idaho Public Services Commission regulating the three main utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,Idaho's energy landscape supports the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,"The state is rich in renewable energy resources, but has limited fossil fuel resources."
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller watersheds provide Idaho with some of the country's best hydroelectric resources and geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind power potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353, These realities have shaped most of the state's energy landscape.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports most of the energy it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355," Imports account for more than 80% of energy consumption, including the total supply of natural gas and oil to Idaho and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"In 2005, 48% of the electricity consumed in Idaho came from hydropower, 42% came from coal combustion and 9% from natural gas combustion."
5357,11,idaho,5357,The rest comes from other renewable sources such as wind.
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The numerous river basins in the state allow hydropower plants to supply 556,000 MWh, representing about three quarters of the electricity generated by Idaho in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,The state of Washington supplies most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two major gas pipeline networks that supply the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360," Although the State relies on sources outside the State for its total supply of natural gas, it uses natural gas-fired power plants to produce 127 000 MWh, or about 10 per cent of its production."
5361,11,idaho,5361, Coal production and the small range of state wind turbines feed the rest of the state's electricity generation.
5362,11,idaho,5362,The state produces 739 000 MWh but still has to import half of its electricity from outside to meet demand.
5363,11,idaho,5363," While Idaho's 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) are small compared to other states and account for only 0.5% of U.S. consumption, the state also has the country's 11th smallest population, or 1.5 million people, so that its per capita energy consumption of BTU 352 million (103 MWh) is just above the national average of BTU 333 million (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th state in terms of the area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), the distance creates the additional problem of the ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365," When the length of an electric transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electric current passing through it is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States, with the population expected to increase by 31% between 2008 and 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367," This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, which will further increase Idaho's limited hydroelectric resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has a higher estimate of the development potential to produce 44,320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind energy, and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar energy using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of photovoltaics on roofs, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar energy."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Department of Transport is the government agency responsible for the Idaho transport infrastructure, including operation and maintenance and planning of future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of federal funds, state funds and grants for government transportation programs."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is one of the few states of the nation without a major highway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"The United States-95 connects the two ends of the state, but like many other Idaho highways, it is in great need of repairs and improvements."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Department of Transport stated that the Government's road infrastructure was facing an annual deficit of $200 million in maintenance and improvement."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main road connecting the south-east and south-west parts of the State, as well as I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Major Federal Aid Routes in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"Major airports include the Boise International Airport serving the southwestern Idaho region and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) serving northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377, Other scheduled airports include Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving the Palouse; Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and the north and west centre of Idaho; Magic Valley Regional Airport at Twin Falls; Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and Pocatello Regional Airport.
5378,11,idaho,5378,Idaho is served by three transcontinental railways.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland and Spokane to the west and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"BNSF crosses the counties of Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary."
5381,11,idaho,5381,The Union Pacific Railway crosses the North Idaho between Canada via Boundary and Bonner and is heading towards Spokane.
5382,11,idaho,5382,"Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Northern Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon."
5383,11,idaho,5383,"Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses the northern Idaho, with its only stop at Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384," Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho"
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific Railroad also crosses southern Idaho between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,Lewiston Harbour is the most remote port in the Pacific on the west coast.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and Columbia River facilitate the movement of barges from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded onto ocean vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,The constitution of Idaho is roughly shaped on the national Constitution with several additions.
5389,11,idaho,5389,The Constitution defines the form and functions of the government of the State and may be amended by plebiscite.
5390,11,idaho,5390,"In particular, the Constitution of the State currently requires the Government of the State to maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391,"As a result, Idaho has a limited debt (construction bonds, etc.)"
5392,11,idaho,5392,..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
5393,11,idaho,5393,All the laws of the State of Idaho are contained in the Code and the Statute of Idaho.
5394,11,idaho,5394,The Code is amended by the Legislative Assembly with the approval of the Governor.
5395,11,idaho,5395,The Idaho still operates in accordance with its original constitution (1889).
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The constitution of Idaho provides for three powers of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"The Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected in 35 legislative districts, each represented by one senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398," Since 1946, state-wide constitutional administrators have been elected for a four-year term."
5399,11,idaho,5399," These include the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the State of Idaho (prior to 1994), the Treasurer, the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Instruction."
5400,11,idaho,5400," Last questioned in 1966, the Inspector of Mines was a constitutional post originally elected."
5401,11,idaho,5401," Subsequently, this position was appointed and finally abolished entirely in 1974."
5402,11,idaho,5402,The government of Idaho has a monopoly on alcohol.
5403,11,idaho,5403,The Governor of Idaho has a four-year term and is elected in the so-called national mid-term elections.
5404,11,idaho,5404,The Governor is therefore not elected in the same election year as the President of the United States.
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current governor is Republican Brad Little, elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,Idaho's legislature is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407," However, the session can be extended if necessary and is often extended."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"As a result, Idaho's legislators are considered ""citizen legislators"", which means that their position as legislator is not their main business."
5409,11,idaho,5409,The terms of office of the senator and the House of Representatives are two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410,"The general elections take place every year, even if numbered."
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The Idaho Legislature has been permanently controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although democratic legislators are systematically elected from Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and the north of Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,The Supreme Court of Idaho is the Supreme Court of Idaho.
5413,11,idaho,5413," There is also an intermediate court of appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeal, which hears cases referred to it by the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The State District Courts serve seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,Idaho is divided into political courts designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416," Since 1919, there have been 44 counties in the state, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 km2)."
5417,11,idaho,5417, Three counties were first designated as such by the territorial legislature of Washington in 1861.
5418,11,idaho,5418," Since 1861, Nez Percé County has been divided into counties of Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai and Clearwater."
5419,11,idaho,5419,The Idaho license plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county name.
5420,11,idaho,5420," When a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number is preceded by alphabetical order."
5421,11,idaho,5421," This reflects an abnormal situation that coincides with the fact that 10 counties start with B, 7 with C and 4 with L, which represents 21 of the 44 counties."
5422,11,idaho,5422," After the civil war, many democrats from the Midwest and the South moved to Idaho territory."
5423,11,idaho,5423,"As a result, the first territorial legislatures were firmly controlled by the Democrats."
5424,11,idaho,5424,"On the other hand, most territorial governors were appointed by Republican presidents and were Republicans."
5425,11,idaho,5425," This led to sometimes bitter clashes between the two parties, including a war of scope with the Democrats supporting the shepherds and the Republicans the breeders, which ended in the trial for the murder of ""Diamondfield"" Jack Davis."
5426,11,idaho,5426,"In the 1880s, Republicans became more important in local politics."
5427,11,idaho,5427,In 1864 Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and state constitution from a locked safe and took them to Boise.
5428,11,idaho,5428," This did indeed move the capital from where it was stored (Lewiston, Idaho) to the current capital, Boise."
5429,11,idaho,5429," Since the creation of the state, the Republican Party has usually been the dominant party of Idaho."
5430,11,idaho,5430,"At one point, Idaho had two democratic parties, one being the general public and the other called the anti-Marmon Democrats, which lasted at the beginning of the 20th century."
5431,11,idaho,5431,"In the 1890s and early 1900s, the populist party dominated, while the Democratic Party maintained a brief domination in the 1930s during the Great Depression."
5432,11,idaho,5432," Since the Second World War, most of the state-wide elected representatives have been Republicans, although the Democrats held a majority in the House (by a seat) in 1958 and in the post of Governor from 1971 to 1995."
5433,11,idaho,5433,The delegations of the Idaho Congress have also been generally republican since the creation of the state.
5434,11,idaho,5434," Several Idaho Democrats have had electoral success in the House over the years, but the Senator's delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades."
5435,11,idaho,5435," Several Idaho Republicans, including the current Senator Mike Crapo, won the re-election in the Senate, but only Frank Church won the re-election as a Democrat."

6339,13,indiana,6339,Indiana has had a great sporting success at the college level.

6348,13,indiana,6348,A high percentage of Indiana's income comes from manufacturing.
6349,13,indiana,6349," According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 17 per cent of the government's non-agricultural workforce is employed in manufacturing, the highest of all states in the United States."

6351,13,indiana,6351," Despite its dependence on manufacturing, Indiana has been less affected by the decline in traditional Rust Belt manufacturing than many of its neighbours."
6352,13,indiana,6352,The explanation seems to be a number of factors in the labour market.
6353,13,indiana,6353,"First of all, a large part of heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires a highly skilled workforce, and companies are often willing to find where there are already skills that are difficult to train."
6354,13,indiana,6354,"Second, Indiana's labour force is found primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises."
6355,13,indiana,6355, This allows companies to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be the case.
6356,13,indiana,6356, Companies often see Indiana as a chance to acquire above-average skills at below-average wages.

6373,13,indiana,6373,"In some jurisdictions, an additional food and beverage tax is imposed, at a rate of 1% (the Marion County rate is 2%), on sales of prepared meals and beverages."
6374,13,indiana,6374,Property taxes are levied on Indiana's real and personal property and are administered by the Department of Finance of local governments.
6375,13,indiana,6375,"The property is subject to taxation by various taxing units (schools, counties, townships, municipalities and libraries), making the total tax rate the sum of tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which a property is located."
6376,13,indiana,6376," However, a ""breakwater"" law enacted on 19 March 2008 limits property tax to 1% of the assessed value for owners, 2% for rental properties and agricultural land, and 3% for businesses."
6377,13,indiana,6377,"Indiana does not have a legal obligation to balance the state budget, either in law or in its constitution."

6385,13,indiana,6385,"In 2010, Indiana had estimated coal reserves at 57 billion tons and public mining activities produced 35 million tons of coal per year."
6386,13,indiana,6386,"Indiana also has at least 900 million barrels of oil reserves in the Trenton field, although they are not easy to recover."
6387,13,indiana,6387," While Indiana is committed to increasing the use of renewable resources such as wind, hydro, biomass and solar energy, progress has been very slow, mainly due to the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana."
6388,13,indiana,6388, Most of the new state facilities are coal gasification plants.
6389,13,indiana,6389, Another source is hydraulic energy.
6390,13,indiana,6390,Wind energy has been developed.

6396,13,indiana,6396,"A long-standing proposal to make Gary Chicago International Airport the third major Chicago airport received a boost in early 2006, with $48 million in federal funding approved over the next ten years."
6397,13,indiana,6397,No airlines operate from the Terre Haute regional airport but are used for private aircraft.
6398,13,indiana,6398," Since 1954, 181 Wing of the Indiana National Air Guard has been stationed there, but the 2005 Realignment and Closure Base (BRAC) proposal indicated that the 181st would lose its fighter mission and the F-16 aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility with a combat aircraft facility."

6411,13,indiana,6411," Once completed, I-69 will cross 142 additional miles (229 km) across the state."
6412,13,indiana,6412," Most Indiana counties use a network-based system to identify county roads; this system has replaced the old arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) it is much easier to identify the call sources placed in the 9-1-1 system."
6413,13,indiana,6413, These systems are easier to implement in the glacially flat northern and central parts of the state.
6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to depend on non-systematic road names (e.g. Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott and Washington counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415, There are also counties in the northern regions of the State that have never set up a grid or implemented only part of it.
6416,13,indiana,6416," Some counties also have a grid system that is almost similar to that of diamonds (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson and Knox counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417, Such a system is also almost useless in these situations as well.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"One day, Knox County used two different network systems for county roads because the county was developed using two different surveying systems, but it has since decided to use road names and to combine roads instead."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"In particular, the road network of St. Joseph County, whose main city is South Bend, uses the names of perennial trees (i.e., the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, and the name of the tree."

6542,14,iowa,6542,"Fort Madison was built to control the trade and establish American domination over Upper Mississippi, but it was misconceived and hostile by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom were allies with the British, who had not abandoned the claims of the territory."

6549,14,iowa,6549,"A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison, which ceded much of Illinois to the United States, enraged many Sauk and led to the Black Hawk War in 1832."
6550,14,iowa,6550,"The Sauks and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley in 1832 in the purchase of Black Hawk and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of which settled in a reserve in Kansas."

6553,14,iowa,6553," However, contrary to the unprecedented act of the Iowa Legislature, the United States Federal Government, through the use of treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk of Iowa in 1848, and the Dakota of Iowa in 1858."

6560,14,iowa,6560,"On 28 December 1846, Iowa became the 29th State of the Union when President James K. Polk signed the Iowa admission law."
6561,14,iowa,6561," Once admitted to the Union, the problems of the state border solved, and most of its land purchased from the natives, Iowa gave its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the rich agricultural land of the young border state, good citizens, free and open society, and good government."
6562,14,iowa,6562,The Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs.
6563,14,iowa,6563,The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of the state in Fairfield.
6564,14,iowa,6564,"The first fair was held from October 25 to 27, 1854, at a cost of approximately $323."
6565,14,iowa,6565," Subsequently, the fair moved to places closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent house in Des Moines."
6566,14,iowa,6566," Since then, the State Fair has been held every year, with a few exceptions: 1898 due to the war between Spain and America and the World Fair in Omaha, Nebraska, nearby; 1942-19, due to the Second World War, because the fairs were used as a supply depot for the army; and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."
6567,14,iowa,6567,"The Iowa supported the Union during the civil war, voting strongly for Abraham Lincoln, although there was an anti-war movement ""Copperhead"" in the state, caused in part by a fall in crop prices caused by the war."
6568,14,iowa,6568," There were no battles in the state, although the Battle of Athens, the Missouri, 1861, was fought just opposite the River Des Moines of Croton, the Iowa, and the shots of the battle landed in the Iowa."
6569,14,iowa,6569,The Iowa sent great food to the armies and towns of the East.

6572,14,iowa,6572,"Iowa contributed proportionally more men to the military service of the civil war than any other state, north or south, by sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, more than a sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates went to Appomattox."
6573,14,iowa,6573, Most of them fought in the large countryside in the Mississippi Valley and in the south.

6580,14,iowa,6580," After the civil war, the population of Iowa continued to grow considerably, from 674,913 in 1860 to 1,624,615 in 1880."
6581,14,iowa,6581,The U.S. civil war briefly brought higher profits.

6586,14,iowa,6586," Starting from the first industries developed in the 1830s, which were mainly intended for the processing of materials grown in the region, Iowa experienced a gradual increase in the number of enterprises and manufacturing operations."
6587,14,iowa,6587,The transition from an agricultural to a mixed economy has been slow.
6588,14,iowa,6588,"The Great Depression and the Second World War accelerated the transition from smallholder agriculture to larger farms, and began a trend towards urbanization."

7737,16,kentucky,7737," Nevertheless, during the 19th century, Kentucky received a large number of German immigrants, who settled mainly in the Midwest, along Ohio, mainly in Louisville, Covington and Newport."
7738,16,kentucky,7738," Only Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia have higher percentages of German ancestry than Kentucky among the southern states defined by the census, although the percentage of Kentucky is closer to Arkansas and Virginia than that of the previously designated state."

7902,17,louisiana,7902,"For example, Vincennes and Peoria were the limit of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (in the upper Wabash near Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (nearly today Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada."
7903,17,louisiana,7903,"The colony of Natchitoches (long of the Red River in the present northwest of Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana."
7904,17,louisiana,7904,"The French establishment had two objectives: to establish exchanges with the Spaniards in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances in Louisiana."
7905,17,louisiana,7905,"The colony soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were exploited by imported African slaves."
7906,17,louisiana,7906,"Over time, planters have developed large plantations and built beautiful houses in a growing city."
7907,17,louisiana,7907," This has become a repeated model in New Orleans and in other places, although the cultivation of commodities in the south was mainly sugar cane."
7908,17,louisiana,7908,"The French colonies of Louisiana contributed to exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of Mississippi and its main tributaries, from Louisiana to the north of the area called Illinois, around St. Louis, now Missouri."
7909,17,louisiana,7909,The latter was colonized by French settlers from Illinois.
7910,17,louisiana,7910," Initially, Mobile then Biloxi served as the capital of Louisiana."
7911,17,louisiana,7911," Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River for trade and military interests, and seeking to protect the capital from strong coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civil and military authority in the south of the Great Lakes."
7912,17,louisiana,7912," From then on, until the United States acquired the territory in Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and lands west of Mississippi."
7913,17,louisiana,7913,"In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along Mississippi, in an area called the German coast."
7914,17,louisiana,7914,"France gave up most of its territory east of Mississippi to Britain in 1763, after Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War (generally called the French and Indian War in North America)."
7915,17,louisiana,7915,"The rest of Louisiana, including the New Orleans region and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, had become a colony of Spain by the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)."
7916,17,louisiana,7916,The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.
7917,17,louisiana,7917,"In 1765, during Spanish domination, several thousand Francophone refugees from the Acadia region (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada) visited Louisiana after being expelled from their homeland by the British during the French and Indian War."
7918,17,louisiana,7918," They settled mainly in the southwestern region of Louisiana, now known as Acadiana."
7919,17,louisiana,7919," Governor Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, eager to win more settlers, welcomed the Acadian refugees, ancestors of the Cajuns of Louisiana."
7920,17,louisiana,7920,"The Spanish Canary Islands, called Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783."
7921,17,louisiana,7921,"In 1800, Frenchman Napoleon Bonaparte took over Louisiana from Spain in the treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years."
7922,17,louisiana,7922,"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, carrying them from a French colony to the West Indies."
7923,17,louisiana,7923,"In 1709, French financier Antoine Crozat obtained the monopoly of trade in La Louisiana, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois."
7924,17,louisiana,7924,"""This concession allowed him to bring a shipment of African blacks every year,"" writes British historian Hugh Thomas."
7925,17,louisiana,7925," Physical conditions, including illness, were so harsh that there was high mortality among both settlers and slaves, resulting in continued demand for and import of slaves."
7926,17,louisiana,7926," Starting in 1719, traders began importing more slaves; two French ships, Du Maine and Aurore, arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves from Africa."
7927,17,louisiana,7927, Louisiana's former slaves had been transported from the French colonies of the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721 New Orleans had 1,256 inhabitants, about half of whom were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724, the French government published a law called Code Noir (""Code Noir"" in English) which ""regulates the interaction of white [white] and black [black] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much greater than the present state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law included 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, prohibited ""interracial"" marriages (those between persons of different skin colour, whose varying nuances were also defined by law), restricted the Manumission, described the legal penalties imposed on slaves for various offences and defined certain obligations of the owners towards their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main objective of the French government was to assert control over the system of agricultural slavery in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slave owners.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Black Code was extremely difficult to enforce by far."
7933,17,louisiana,7933," Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slave owners continued to manipulate slaves without permission, while others brutally punished slaves."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Black Code of 1724 obliges the owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the State religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935, Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On days off, slaves were expected to feed and care for themselves."
7937,17,louisiana,7937," During the economic crisis of the 1740s in the colony, the owners had difficulty feeding their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938," Giving them free time also gave more power to the slaves, who began to cultivate their own gardens and make items for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939," They began to participate in the economic development of the colony, while increasing independence and self-subsistence."
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Black Code prohibits mixed marriages, prohibits mixed marriages, but hardly protects women slaves against the rape of their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941," Overall, the Code benefits the owners, but has more protection and flexibility than the establishment of slavery in the 13 southern colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The 1806 Louisiana Black Code makes cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers are rarely prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"Fugitive slaves, called marons, could easily hide in the hinterland of the bay and survive in small colonies."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maroon"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", i.e. ""fugal bovin""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"At the end of the 18th century, the last Spanish governor of Louisiana wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946," When the United States bought Louisiana in 1803, it was quickly accepted that African slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighbouring Mississippi, although it violated American law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947," Despite the demands of Rep. James Hillhouse of the United States and the brochure Thomas Paine to apply the federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the cheapest labour."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small sugar producer with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Santo Domingo and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949," Shortly thereafter, it became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations."
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, the first American governor of Louisiana, said that the work of African slaves was necessary because white workers ""can't have in this unhealthy climate."""
7951,17,louisiana,7951," Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to impose the abolition of the slave trade in Africa, which the United States and Great Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastal trade, the shipping of slaves along the Atlantic coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"In 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the United States, making a significant contribution to the economy of the city and the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,New Orleans had become one of the richest cities and the third largest city in the country.
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and the importation of slaves has increased demand in the domestic market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"Over the decades since the American Revolutionary War, more than a million enslaved Africans have been forced to migrate from the Upper South to the deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957, Others were transported by their owners as slave owners moved westward for new land.
7958,17,louisiana,7958," With the shift in agriculture in the Upper South as planters moved from tobacco to less labour intensive mixed farming, planters had surplus workers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959, Many sold slaves to traders to take them to the deep South.
7960,17,louisiana,7960, Slaves were driven by Upper South traders or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by boat as part of the coastal slave trade.
7961,17,louisiana,7961," After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations in Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,The Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted between 1769 and 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963," Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place in Santo Domingo, following a slave rebellion that began in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants have landed from the island in Louisiana, including ethnic Europeans, free people of colour and African slaves, some of whom are brought by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965," They have greatly increased the Francophone population of New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and slaves have strengthened African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The independence process in Santo Domingo is complex, but the uprisings continue."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803 France withdrew its surviving troops from the island, after having suffered the loss of two thirds sent to the island two years earlier, mainly with yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic of the Western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, carried out by the slave leaders."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) stated: ""Saint-Domingue is, of all our colonies in the West Indies, the one whose mentality and customs have most influenced Louisiana."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970," When the United States gained independence from Britain in 1783, one of its main concerns was to have European power at its western border and the need for unlimited access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachians constituted an obstacle to the movement of goods eastward."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship the products was to use a flat boat to float it in Ohio and Mississippi to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be placed on ocean vessels."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this road was that the Spaniards had both sides of Mississippi below Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974, Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involve the creation of a new empire focused on the Caribbean sugar trade.
7975,17,louisiana,7975," Under the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Britain referred to the French for ownership of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe."
7976,17,louisiana,7976," Napoleon regarded Louisiana as a deposit for these sugar islands, and as a buffer for American colonization."
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a great military force to resume Santo Domingo, then under the control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.When the army led by Napoleon Leclerc's brother-in-law was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was troubled by Napoleon's plans to re-establish the French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979," With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could at any time close Mississippi to the American trade."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, American minister in France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, parts of the east shore of Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for American trade."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston was allowed to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer from Louisiana to the French property had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's transaction with the Spaniards was a poorly guarded secret at the border."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public Spain's intention to revoke the right of deposit in New Orleans for any cargo originating in the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and dismay.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,"In the west, trade was virtually blocked."
7986,17,louisiana,7986," Historians believe that the revocation of the deposit was caused by the abuses committed by the Americans, in particular by smuggling, and not by the French intrigues, as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987," President Jefferson ignored public pressure for the war with France, and appointed James Monroe as special envoy to Napoleon, to help secure New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson also increased authorized spending to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989," However, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how willing the United States was to pay for the whole of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered it)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon could withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them without being able to get the desired area of New Orleans), and that President Jefferson's approval could take months, so that Livingston and Monroe decided to open the negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"As at 30 April, they entered into a transaction for the purchase of the entire territory of Louisiana of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for 60 million francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,Part of this $3.5 million was used to cancel France's debts to the United States.
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in US bonds, which Napoleon sold in nominal value to the Dutch company Hope and Company, and the British bank house of Baring, at a discount of 87 1⁄2 per unit of $100."
7994,17,louisiana,7994," Accordingly, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"The English banker Alexander Baring confided Marbois in Paris, fled to the United States to recover the bonds, took them to Great Britain and returned to France with the money Napoleon was waging war against his own country."
7996,17,louisiana,7996," When news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,He had authorized an expenditure of $10 million for a port city and received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a set of land that would double the size of the country.
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents in the Federalist Party argued that the purchase in Louisiana was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or the negotiation of treaties without the consent of the senator."
7999,17,louisiana,7999," What really worries the opposition is the new states that will inevitably be cut off from Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England's federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000, President Jefferson was a strong supporter of westward expansion and was firm in his support for the treaty.
8001,17,louisiana,8001," Despite federalist objections, the American senator ratified the Treaty of Louisiana on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002,"By law promulgated on 31 October 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories transferred by France and to provide for initial governance."
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004,"As the territory of Louisiana had never been officially handed over to the French, the Spaniards removed their flag and the French lifted their flag."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,"The next day, General James Wilkinson accepted the possession of New Orleans for the United States."
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony took place in Saint-Louis on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The next day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the first United States"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,The artillery marched its troops in the city and ran the American flag to the mast of the fort.
8009,17,louisiana,8009,"The territory of Louisiana is officially transferred to the Government of the United States, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010," Louisiana's territory, purchased for less than three hundred per acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and created a precedent for buying territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It paved the way for the expansion of the United States throughout the continent to the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012," Shortly after the seizure of possession of the United States, the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on March 26, 1804, thus organizing the territory of Orleans to the south and the district of Louisiana (which then formed like the territory of Louisiana) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013, Louisiana became the eighteenth state of the United States on 30 April 1812; the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana and the territory of Louisiana was simultaneously renamed the territory of Missouri.
8014,17,louisiana,8014,An area known as Florida Parishes was soon annexed to Louisiana on 14 April 1812.
8015,17,louisiana,8015," From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a two-party system, with the Democrats fighting first the Whigs, then the Know Nothings, and finally the Democrats alone."
8016,17,louisiana,8016," According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, or nearly 47 per cent of the total population of the State (708,002)."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,The strong economic interest of the elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to separate from the Union on 26 January 1861.
8018,17,louisiana,8018,He followed other southern states in secession after Abraham Lincoln's election as President of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019,"The secession of Louisiana was announced on January 26, 1861, and was one of the Confederate States of America."
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated in the civil war, the result of the Union's strategy to cut Confederation in half by seizing Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,The federal troops captured New Orleans on 25 April 1862.
8022,17,louisiana,8022," Since a large part of the population had sympathy from the Union (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the Federally-controlled Louisiana areas as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives in the US Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023," Following the civil war and the emancipation of slaves, violence intensified in the South as the war was waged by insurgent private and paramilitary groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024," Initially, state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who adopted black codes to regulate free men and generally refused to vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025, They refused to extend the right to vote to African Americans who had been free before the war and who had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).
8026,17,louisiana,8026," Following the Memphis riots of 1866 and the riot in New Orleans that same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted which provided the vote and full citizenship for the released men."
8027,17,louisiana,8027," Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, creating military districts for states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,It was regrouped with Texas in what was administered as the fifth military district.
8029,17,louisiana,8029, African-Americans have begun to live as citizens with some equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030,"Free men and people of colour who had been free before the war began to make more progress in education, family stability and employment."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was enormous social volatility in the aftermath of the war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labour market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in the Ku Klux Klan chapters."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"In 1877, when the federal forces were withdrawn, the white democrats of Louisiana and other states regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which eliminated the black vote through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034," According to the example of Mississippi in 1890, in 1898, the white, democratic, planter-dominated legislature adopted a new constitution that effectively deprived people of colour of their right to vote, raising obstacles to voter registration, such as voting taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect is immediate and lasting.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the lists of electors and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the population of the State, which was also divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"In 1900, the population of the State was 47% African-American, a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038," Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of colour, the large population of people free of colour before the civil war."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"In 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"In 1910, there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 per cent of eligible African American men), despite the progress made in education and literacy among blacks and people of colour."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"The White Democrats established a one-party democratic regime, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until, after the passage by Congress of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the federal government ensured the monitoring and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African-Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration northward to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,The infestation of the plough and agricultural problems have cost many farmers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,The mechanization of agriculture also reduces the need for workers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046," Beginning in the 1940s, Blacks went to California for jobs in its expanding defence industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047," During part of the Great Depression, Louisiana was led by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected for a populist appeal.
8049,17,louisiana,8049," His public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased the vote for the poor whites, but Long was criticized for his supposedly demagogical and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He extended the control of favouritism to all branches of the government of the state of Louisiana.
8051,17,louisiana,8051, His plans for the redistribution of wealth in the state were particularly controversial.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule came to an abrupt end when he was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,Mobilization for the Second World War created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,But thousands of other black and white workers have migrated to California for better jobs in its booming defence industry.
8055,17,louisiana,8055," Many African-Americans left the state during the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s to the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had greatly reduced the need for workers.
8057,17,louisiana,8057," They were looking for specialized jobs in the defence industry in California, better education for their children, and lived in communities where they could vote."
8058,17,louisiana,8058,"On 26 November 1958, at Chennault Air Base, a USAF B-47 bomber with a nuclear weapon on board fired at the ground."
8059,17,louisiana,8059,The wreckage of the aircraft and the accident site were contaminated after a limited explosion of non-nuclear material.
8060,17,louisiana,8060,"In the 1950s, the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration."
8061,17,louisiana,8061," Despite opposition from the State Rights Party, low-state black voters have begun to increase their registration rates, which also reflects the growth of their middle classes."
8062,17,louisiana,8062,"In 1960, the State established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation."
8063,17,louisiana,8063," Despite this, the registration and turnout of black voters has gradually increased to 20 per cent or more, and it was 32 per cent in 1964, when the first national legislation on civil rights of the time was adopted."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"The percentage of black voters varied widely during these years, from 93.8% in the evangelical parish to 1.7% in the parish of Tensas, for example, where there were white efforts to suppress the vote in the parish with a black majority."
8065,17,louisiana,8065,"Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill cities were catalysts for the creation of the first two chapters of the Deacons of Defence and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, respectively, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa."

8070,17,louisiana,8070,"The 1,039,207 black citizens were again repressed by segregation and exclusion."
8071,17,louisiana,8071, African-Americans continue to suffer from a disproportionate discriminatory application of state rules on voter registration.
8072,17,louisiana,8072," Due to better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970 Blacks continued to emigrate to Louisiana for a net loss of more than 37,000 people."
8073,17,louisiana,8073,"On the basis of official census figures, the African-American population in 1970 was 1,085,109 persons, a net gain of more than 46,000 persons compared to 1960."
8074,17,louisiana,8074," During this last period, some people began to migrate to New South cities to find opportunities."
8075,17,louisiana,8075," Since then, blacks have entered the political system and have begun to be elected to power, as well as to have other possibilities."
8076,17,louisiana,8076,"On 21 May 1919, the nineteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, giving women the full right to vote, was adopted at the national level and was made law throughout the United States on 18 August 1920."
8077,17,louisiana,8077, Louisiana finally ratified this amendment on 11 June 1970.
8078,17,louisiana,8078," Because of its location on the Gulf coast, Louisiana has regularly suffered from the effects of tropical storms and adverse hurricanes."
8079,17,louisiana,8079,"On August 29, 2005, New Orleans and many other lower parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were affected by Hurricane Katrina."
8080,17,louisiana,8080,It caused considerable damage due to the breakage of dykes and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city.
8081,17,louisiana,8081," Officials issued warnings to evacuate the city and surrounding areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, remained behind, many of whom remained blocked."
8082,17,louisiana,8082, Many people died and survivors suffered from floodwater damage.

8092,17,louisiana,8092,"On June 4, Governor John Bel Edwards signed an order to proceed to the second phase."
8093,17,louisiana,8093,It's government.
8094,17,louisiana,8094,Edwards extended the second phase until September 11 and the third phase began with speculation on October 9.
8095,17,louisiana,8095, Louisiana is bordered to the west by Texas
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The state can be well divided into two parts, the northern highlands, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial area includes low marshlands, coastal marshes and beaches, and barrier islands that cover approximately 20,000 square miles (32,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098," This area is mainly along the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi, which crosses the state from north to south for a distance of about 600 mi (970 km) and flows into the Gulf of Mexico; the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The width of the alluvial region along Mississippi is 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100 km), and along the other rivers the alluvial region has an average of about 10 miles (15 km) on the other side."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as leve), from which land declines to a river beyond an average fall of six feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,Alluvial lands along other streams have similar characteristics.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The higher and contiguous hills of the north and north-western parts of the State have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103, They consist of meadows and wood.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,Altitudes above sea level range from 10 feet (3 m) on the coast and marshy lands to 50–60 feet (15–18 m) on grasslands and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the highlands and hills, elevations reach Mount Driskill, the highest point in the state at only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106," From 1932 to 2010, the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rising sea levels and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,"The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPAR) spends approximately $1 billion annually to assist in the establishment and protection of the shores and lands of Louisiana, both at the federal and state levels."
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"In addition to the previously named rivers, there are the Sabine River, which forms the western boundary; and the Pearl River, the eastern boundary; the Calcasieu River, the Mermentau River, the Vermilion River, the Bayou Teche, the Atchafalaya, the Boeuf River, the Bayou Lafourche River, the Courtableau River, the Bayou D'Arbonne River, the Macon River, the Tensas River, the Amite River, the Tchefuncte River, the Tickfaw River, the Natalbany River, and a number of other smaller rivers, constituting a natural network of navigable rivers, with a length of more than 6,400 km."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The State also has political jurisdiction over the portion of approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) of underwater land on the inner continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110," Thanks to a particular feature of the political geography of the United States, it is a territory far less than the 14-kilometre-wide jurisdiction of the neighbouring states of Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have vast Gulf coasts."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is one of the fastest extinct areas in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112, This is largely due to poor management of the coast by humans (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one point, the land was added as spring flooding of the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated the growth of the marshes."
8114,17,louisiana,8114, There are many causes.
8115,17,louisiana,8115, Artificial dikes block spring floodwater that would bring fresh water and sediment to the marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"The marshes have been widely exploited, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inward."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move seawater inland, damaging swamps and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,The rise in seawater has aggravated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119, Some researchers estimate that the state loses a mass of land equivalent to 30 football fields every day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120," Many proposals are aimed at saving coastal areas by reducing human damage, including the restoration of the natural floods in Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121,"In the absence of such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as communities disappear, more and more people leave the region."
8123,17,louisiana,8123,"As coastal wetlands support an economically significant inshore fishery, the loss of wetlands has a negative impact on this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,"The Gulf of Mexico ""dead zone"" off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurrent hypoxic zone in the United States."
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"In 2017, it was 32,730 km2 and was the largest ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico did not exist 250 million years ago when there was only one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As the Pangea divides, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico open."
8128,17,louisiana,8128," Louisiana has slowly developed, for millions of years, from water to land and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,The oldest rocks are exposed in the north in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest.
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date back to the early Cenozoic era, some 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,The history of the formation of these rocks is found in D. Spearing's Roadside Geology of Louisiana.
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest regions of the state have been formed over the last 12,000 years as successive Mississippi deltas: Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, modern Mississippi, and now Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133,The sediments were transported from north to south by the Mississippi River.
8134,17,louisiana,8134," Between the tertiary rocks of the north and the relatively new sediments along the coast, there is a large belt known as Terrasses du Pleistocene."
8135,17,louisiana,8135, Their age and distribution can be largely related to rising and falling sea levels in the later ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had enough time for rivers to cut deep canals, while the more recent terraces tend to be much flattered."
8137,17,louisiana,8137, There are also salty domes in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138, Their origin dates back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean experienced high evaporation rates.
8139,17,louisiana,8139," There are several hundred salty domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140,The salt domes are not only a source of salt.
8141,17,louisiana,8141," Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long, warm, humid summers and short, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which, at its furthest point, is not more than 200 mi (320 km)."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rains are common throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's wet season."
8144,17,louisiana,8144, There was an immersion in the precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, storms are built during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief tropical precipitation."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June to September, with an average of 90°F (32°C) or higher, and night bass above 70°F (21°C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148," Sometimes temperatures in the 1990s F, combined with dew points in the higher 70s F, create sensitive temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and films."
8150,17,louisiana,8150," Temperatures are generally warm in winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico on average 66°F (19°C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the state is slightly cold in winter, with average levels of 59°F (15°C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152," Low nights in winter averaged well above freezing in the entire state, with 46°F (8°C) average near the Gulf and an average low of 37°F (3°C) in winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153," Occasionally, the cold fronts of the low pressure centres in the north reach Louisiana in winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154," Low temperatures close to 20°F (−7°C) sometimes occur in the northern part of the state, but rarely in the southern part of the state."
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although northern residents can receive snow dust a few times a decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"The highest temperature recorded in Louisiana was 114°F (46°C) in Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded was −16°F (−27°C) in Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157," Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to major hurricane strikes, particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans region."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, with many bayous, marshes and inlets, can cause damage to water through a large area of major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The region is also subject to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state is on average more than 60 days of storms per year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161, Louisiana has an annual average of 27 tornadoes.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado, with the extreme south of the state slightly less than the rest of the state."
8163,17,louisiana,8163," tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the State, and from February to March in the northern part of the State."
8164,17,louisiana,8164," Due to its location and geology, the state has a great biodiversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165," Some vital areas, such as southwestern prairie, experienced a loss of more than 98 per cent."
8166,17,louisiana,8166," Flat pines are also very threatened, mainly by fire extinction and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167, There is still no well-organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168," Such a system would consist of a protected system of basic areas connected by biological corridors, as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169," Louisiana contains a number of areas that, to varying degrees, prevent people from using them."
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to the service areas of national parks and a national forest in the United States, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, a state conservation area, a state forest and many wildlife management areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of the largest public areas in Louisiana is the Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172," There are about 600,000 acres of land, more than half of which are flat forests, home to many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173, These include the Louisiana snake and the red peacock peak.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The government-owned cypress marsh system around Pontchartrain Lake is another large area, with southern wetland species, including scratches, alligators and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 base areas would be required to construct a ""protected area system"" for the state; these would be southwestern grasslands, the Pearl River floodplain to the east, and the Mississippi alluvial marshes to the north."
8176,17,louisiana,8176," Historic or picturesque areas managed, protected or otherwise recognized by the National Parks Service include:"
8177,17,louisiana,8177," Louisiana operates a network of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and a state conservation area."
8178,17,louisiana,8178," Louisiana has 955,973 acres in four ecoregions under wildlife management by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries."
8179,17,louisiana,8179,Nature Conservation also owns and manages a range of natural areas.
8180,17,louisiana,8180,"The Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System provides a degree of protection to 51 state rivers, streams and bayous rivers."
8181,17,louisiana,8181,It is administered by Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
8182,17,louisiana,8182," Louisiana has 308 incorporated municipalities, consisting of four consolidated Parish cities and 304 cities, towns and villages."
8183,17,louisiana,8183," Louisiana's municipalities cover only 7.9% of the state's land, but account for 45.3% of its population."
8184,17,louisiana,8184,The majority of urban Louisianas live on the coast or in northern Louisiana.

8216,17,louisiana,8216," Because of the French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and the Greater New Orleans region are mainly Catholic."
8217,17,louisiana,8217," Since Creoles were the first settlers, planters and rulers of the Territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics."
8218,17,louisiana,8218," Thus, most of the first governors were Creole Catholics."
8219,17,louisiana,8219," Because Catholics still constitute a large portion of Louisiana's population, they have continued to be influential in state policy."
8220,17,louisiana,8220,The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population make Louisiana distinct from the southern states.

8225,17,louisiana,8225," Louisiana was one of the southern states with a large Jewish population before the 20th century; Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia also had influential Jewish populations in some of their major cities of the 18th and 19th centuries."
8226,17,louisiana,8226,The first Jewish settlers were Sephardic Jews who immigrated with English settlers from London.

8273,17,louisiana,8273, Louisiana's economy and its policy of the last half century cannot be understood without taking full account of the influence of the oil and gas industries.

8278,17,louisiana,8278," Louisiana is home to many, particularly notable are the culture distinct from the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of colour, descendants of mixed free families of the colonial period and early state."
8279,17,louisiana,8279,The French colony of Louisiana has struggled for decades to survive.
8280,17,louisiana,8280,"The conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were not suitable for certain cultures known to settlers, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281, Both the settlers and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"Settlers continued to import slaves, resulting in a high proportion of West Africans, who continued to practice their culture in a new environment."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall describes, they developed an Afro-Creole culture marked in colonial times."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a large influx of white and Métis refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285," This added another infusion of African culture to the city, since more slaves in Santo Domingo were from Africa than in the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286," They have strongly influenced the city's African-American culture with regard to dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is a fusion of French, African, Spanish (and other European) and Amerindian cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word crioulo; originally it referred to a colonist of European origin (especially French) born in the New World, compared to immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289," Louisiana's oldest manuscript to use the word ""Creole"" from 1782 applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,"But originally, it referred more generally to French settlers born in Louisiana."
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, a relatively large group of Colour Creoles (free coloured people) developed in the French colony, mainly descended from African slaves and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mixture, as well as some Native Americans)."
8292,17,louisiana,8292," Often, the French freed their concubines and Métis children, and passed on social capital to them."
8293,17,louisiana,8293," They can, for example, educate sons in France and help them enter the French army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294, They also installed property or possessions on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295,People free of colour have gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education
8296,17,louisiana,8296, Many have become artisans and real estate owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""creole"" has become associated with this class of coloured creoles, many of which reached freedom well before the civil war."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,Rich French Creoles generally maintained homes in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside the city along the Mississippi River.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans has the largest population of people of free colour in the region; they can find work and create their own culture, marrying each other for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"Cajuns' ancestors immigrated mainly from western central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally known as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301," After the British defeat of France in the War of France and India (Seven Years' War) in 1763, France gave up its territory east of Mississippi in Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated the families and expelled them from Acadia because they refused to dedicate loyalty to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304," Some, who escaped from the British, remained in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305," Others are dispersed in France, Canada, Mexico or the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306, Many Acadian refugees settled in southern Louisiana in the Lafayette region and in the country of LaFourche Bayou.
8307,17,louisiana,8307," They developed a distinct rural culture, different from the Creole settlers of New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"By marrying others in the area, they developed what was known as Cajun music, cooking and culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309," Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered to be somewhat derogating."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,A third culture distinct from Louisiana is that of Isleños.
8311,17,louisiana,8311," Its members were descendants of settlers from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and married other communities such as the French, Acadians, Creoles, Spanish and other groups, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, Isleños originally settled in four communities, including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313," Among these colonies, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most prosperous, the other two suffering from disease and flooding."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,"The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community, while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) maintained much of its unique culture and language in the 21st century."
8315,17,louisiana,8315," That being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely stopped in St. Bernard with those who have competence in Spanish being octagenary."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Over the centuries, the different communities of Isleño de Louisiana have kept alive various elements of their Canaries heritage while adopting and relying on the customs and traditions of the communities around them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317," Today, two heritage partners exist for the communities: the Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard and the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana."
8318,17,louisiana,8318,"The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated every year in the parish of Saint-Bernard, which presents heritage performances by local groups and the Canary Islands."
8319,17,louisiana,8319," According to a 2010 study by the Association des langues modernes, among people aged five and over, 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak English only at home, 3.45% French (standard French, French Creole or French Cajun), 3.30% Spanish and 0.59% Vietnamese."
8320,17,louisiana,8320," Historically, the Amerindian peoples of the region at the time of the European meeting were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321,"Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have live native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322," Other American indigenous peoples have migrated to the region, escaping from Eastern European pressure."
8323,17,louisiana,8323," Among them were the Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati and Ofo peoples."
8324,17,louisiana,8324,"As early as the 1700s, French settlers began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans."
8325,17,louisiana,8325, They have created French cultural and linguistic institutions.
8326,17,louisiana,8326," They import thousands of slaves from West African tribes, who speak several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the process of Creolization, the slaves developed a Creole dialect of Louisiana incorporating both French and African forms, which the colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, in particular, who spoke of the French Creole Louisiana."
8329,17,louisiana,8329," During the 19th century after the purchase of Louisiana by the United States, English gradually gained importance for business and government due to the evolution of the population with the establishment by many Americans who were Anglophones."
8330,17,louisiana,8330, Many families of French origin continued to use French in private.
8331,17,louisiana,8331,The slaves and some people of free colour also spoke the Creole French of Louisiana.
8332,17,louisiana,8332,"The Constitution of the State of 1812 gives official status to English in judicial proceedings, but the use of French remains widespread."
8333,17,louisiana,8333,The subsequent constitutions of the State reflect the decreasing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The Constitution of 1868, adopted at the time of the reconstruction before the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, prohibits laws requiring the publication of judicial proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335," Subsequently, the legal status of the French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its reputation before the civil war."
8336,17,louisiana,8336," Several dialects unique in French, Creole and English are spoken in Louisiana."
8337,17,louisiana,8337,The dialects of the French language are colonial French and Houma French.
8338,17,louisiana,8338, Louisiana Creole French is the term for one of the Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339," Two unique dialects developed from the English language: Louisiana English, a variety of English with French influence in which the fall of /r/postvocalism is common; and what is unofficially known as Yat, which resembles the New York City dialect sometimes with southern influences, especially that of historic Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340," Both accents were influenced by large Irish and Italian immigrant communities, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341, Colonial French was the dominant language of white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period.
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, the Métis people and slaves developed Louisiana Creole, with a language base in West Africa."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish domination at the end of the 18th century did not lead to the widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"French Creole and Louisiana are still used in modern Louisiana, often in family gatherings."
8345,17,louisiana,8345,"English and its associated dialects became predominant after Louisiana's purchase of 1803, after which the region became dominated by many Anglophones."
8346,17,louisiana,8346,"In some areas, English has been influenced by French, as we have seen with Louisiana's English."
8347,17,louisiana,8347," Colonial French, although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, persisted alongside English."
8348,17,louisiana,8348,"The renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana led to the creation of Canadian-style French immersion schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic Francophone neighbourhoods of New Orleans and Lafayette."
8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the State has maintained the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which promotes the use of the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations of the State."
8350,17,louisiana,8350,"In 2018, Louisiana became the first American state to join the International Organization of La Francophonie as an observer."

8361,17,louisiana,8361,"The number of students enrolled in private schools in Louisiana decreased by 9% between 2000 and 2005 and 2014, due to the proliferation of chartered schools, the 2008 recession and Hurricane Katrina."
8362,17,louisiana,8362,Ten parishes in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans region recorded a combined decline of 17% in private school enrolment during this period.

8387,17,louisiana,8387, Louisiana's political and legal structure has retained several elements since the time of French and Spanish governance.
8388,17,louisiana,8388,"One is the use of the term ""parish"" (from French: paroisse) instead of ""county"" for the administrative subdivision."
8389,17,louisiana,8389," Another is the legal system of civil law based on the French, German and Spanish legal codes and, finally, Roman law, as opposed to the English common law."
8390,17,louisiana,8390," Louisiana's civil law system is what most of the nations of the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, to the exclusion of those from the British Empire."
8391,17,louisiana,8391," However, it is wrong to equate Louisiana's Civil Code with the Napoleonic Code."
8392,17,louisiana,8392," Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law had common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code had never been in force in Louisiana, as enacted in 1804, after the United States purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803."
8393,17,louisiana,8393," Although the Civil Code of Louisiana of 1808 has been constantly revised and updated since its promulgation, it is still considered the supervisory authority in the State."
8394,17,louisiana,8394, There are differences between Louisiana civil law and the common law of other American states.
8395,17,louisiana,8395," While some of these differences have been bridged by the strong influence of the common law tradition, the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana's private law."
8396,17,louisiana,8396," Thus, the structure of property, contracts, businesses, much of civil and family law, as well as certain aspects of criminal law, are still mainly based on traditional Roman legal thinking."

10743,23,mississippi,10743," Due to seasonal flooding from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries create a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744,"The flood of the river created natural dikes, which the planters had built earlier to try to prevent flooding of cultivated land for cotton cultivation."
10745,23,mississippi,10745, Temporary workers built dikes along the Mississippi River over the natural dikes that formed from the land deposited after the flood of the river.
10746,23,mississippi,10746," From 1858 to 1861, the State took control of the construction of dykes, carrying it out through contractors and labour hires."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters felt that their slaves were too valuable to be hired for such dangerous work."
10748,23,mississippi,10748, Entrepreneurs have hired Irish immigrant gangs to build dykes and sometimes open land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749, Many Irish were relatively recent immigrants in the years of famine that were struggling to settle.
10750,23,mississippi,10750," Prior to the U.S. Civil War, the earth dams had an average height of six feet, although in some areas they reached twenty feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751," Floods have been an integral part of Mississippi's history, but clearing land for the cultivation and supply of wood to steamboats has removed the absorption of trees and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753," After the civil war, major floods destroyed the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754," Such floods have regularly submerged the dikes damaged by the Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those built after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for the southern counties."
10756,23,mississippi,10756,"In 1879, the United States Congress established the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included assisting state moats to build moat."
10757,23,mississippi,10757,"In the late 19th century, temporary white or black workers were hired to build the dykes."
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"In 1882 the dikes averaged seven feet in height, but many in the southern delta were severely affected by flooding that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759," After the flood of 1882, the dyke system was expanded."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the district of Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee was created to oversee the construction and maintenance of dykes in the northern counties of the delta; there were also some Arkansas counties that were part of the delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761," Floods submerged the northwest of Mississippi in 1912-1913, causing heavy damage to the dikes districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,The regional losses and lobbying of the Mississippi River Levee Association for a flood control bill contributed to the passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds to local dyke districts on a 2:1 scale.
10763,23,mississippi,10763," Although U.S. participation in the First World War interrupted the financing of the dikes, the second round of funding increased the average height of the dikes in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764, Scientists now understand that dykes have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of floodplains.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The area was severely damaged as a result of the Mississippi flood in 1927, which crossed the dikes."
10766,23,mississippi,10766," There have been losses of millions of dollars in goods, stocks and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The most serious damage occurred in the lower delta, including Washington and Bolivar counties."
10768,23,mississippi,10768," Although scientific knowledge on the Mississippi River has increased, upstream development and the consequences of dykes have caused more severe flooding in some years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769, Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and the construction of dykes have changed the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770," This work has eliminated the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, thereby strengthening the flow of the river."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The federal and state governments have struggled for the best approaches to restoring certain natural habitats in order to better interact with the original river ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772," Nearly 10,000 Native Americans or Paleo-Indians from BC have arrived in what is now known as the American South."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,"In the South, the Paleo-Indians are hunter-gatherers who pursue the megafauna that is extinct after the end of the Pleistocene age."
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Amerindian colonies and agricultural fields were developed on natural dikes, higher in the vicinity of rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Amerindians developed vast fields near their permanent villages.
10776,23,mississippi,10776," Together with other practices, they created some localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777," After thousands of years, the following crops of the wood era and Mississippi have developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which the surplus has supported the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778, Both were mound-builder cultures.
10779,23,mississippi,10779,"The Mississippi culture was the largest and most complex, built from about 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,"The people had a commercial network that spread throughout the continent, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf coast."
10781,23,mississippi,10781," Their large terraces, which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts, are still in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys."
10782,23,mississippi,10782,Amerindian tribes that descend from Mississippi culture in the southeast include Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783," Other tribes that lived in Mississippi (and whose names were honoured by settlers in local cities) include Natchez, Yazoo and Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition to the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who crossed the northeastern part of the state in 1540, during his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French settlers established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built near current ocean sources on the Gulf coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was installed by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,In 1716 the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (under the name of Fort Rosalie) and became the dominant town and trading post of the region.
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the largest territory ""New France""; the Spanish continued to claim part of the Gulf Coast region (east of Mobile Bay) of the present-day southern Alabama, in addition to the entire current Florida region."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"In the 18th century, the region was governed by Spanish, French and British colonial governments."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,Settlers import African slaves as workers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791," Under French and Spanish domination, there has been the development of a class of people free of colour (people of free colour), mainly multiracial descendants of European men and black women enslaved or free, and their Métis children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,"At first, French and Spanish settlers were mostly men."
10793,23,mississippi,10793," While more and more European women have joined the colonies, men have race unions between women of African descent (and increasingly of multiracial descent), before and after the marriage of European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"European men often help their multiracial children to educate themselves or to acquire apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settle on them; they often free mothers and their children if they are slaves, under placarding contracts."
10795,23,mississippi,10795," With this social capital, the people free of colour have become artisans, and sometimes educated traders and real estate owners, forming a third class between Europeans and Africans the most slaves in the French and Spanish colonies, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796," After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (seven-year war), the French gave up the Mississippi region to them under the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797," They also divest their areas to the north east of Mississippi, including Illinois and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798," After the Peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish domination as part of western Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819, the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all East Florida in the Adams-Onís Treaty, and in 1822, the two were merged into Florida territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800," After the American revolution (1765–83), Britain gave this region to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801,"The territory of Mississippi was organized on April 7, 1798, from the territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States."
10802,23,mississippi,10802, Their original colonial charters extended theoretically westward to the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803,The territory of Mississippi was expanded twice later to include the disputed territory claimed by the United States and Spain.
10804,23,mississippi,10804," From about 1800 to 1830, the United States purchased land (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Amerindian tribes for new colonies of European Americans."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mostly migrants from other southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were depleted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,New settlers continued to invade the lands of Choctaw and urged the federal government to expel the Amerindians.
10807,23,mississippi,10807,"On September 27, 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the U.S. government and the Choctaw."
10808,23,mississippi,10808,The Choctaws agreed to sell their traditional lands in Mississippi and Alabama for compensation and withdrawal of reserves in Indian territory (now Oklahoma).
10809,23,mississippi,10809, This opened up land for sale to the European-American migrant establishment.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 of the Treaty allows the Choctaws who choose to remain in the states to become American citizens, as they are considered to abandon their tribal affiliation."
10811,23,mississippi,10811," They were the second Aboriginal ethnic group in America to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas instead of joining the abduction)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812," Today, their descendants include about 9,500 people who identify themselves as Choctaw, and who live in Neshoba, Newton, Leake and Jones counties."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band reorganized in the 20th century and is a tribe recognized by the federal government.
10814,23,mississippi,10814," Many slave owners brought African-American slaves with them or bought them through the slave trade, particularly in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"As a result of this trade, nearly a million slaves were forcibly transported to the deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke many families of Upper South slaves, where planters were selling surplus slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816, Southerners imposed slave laws in the deep South and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817," From 1822 on, Mississippi slaves were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishment by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,"In most cases, the codes of the southern slave have made the deliberate killing of a slave illegal."
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, in the 1860 Mississippi case, Oliver v. State accused the accused of killing his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820, Mississippi became the 20th state on 10 December 1817.
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes is the first governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as ancestral land by several American Aboriginal tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823," Plantations were developed mainly along the main rivers, where the seafront provided access to the main transport routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"It is also where the first cities develop, connected by steamboats that transport commercial products and crops to markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The rest of the Amerindian ancestral lands remained largely undeveloped, but were sold by treaty until 1826, when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826," Following the abolition of the Choctaw Tribal Government by the Mississippi State Legislative Assembly in 1829, the Indian Abduction Act of President Andrew Jackson and the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty of 1830, the Choctaws were forced to sell their land and transported to Oklahoma territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, along with other southeastern tribes abducted under the Act, became known as the Tears Trail."
10828,23,mississippi,10828," When cotton was king in the 1850s, the owners of Mississippi plantations, especially those in the central Delta and black belt regions, became rich because of the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market and the free labour acquired through their African-American enslavement outfit."
10829,23,mississippi,10829, They used part of their profits to buy more cotton and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830,The dependence of planters on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labour and the serious imbalances of wealth among whites have played a strong role both in state policy and in supporting planters for secession.
10831,23,mississippi,10831, Mississippi is a slave society whose economy depends on slavery.
10832,23,mississippi,10832,"The State was very sparsely populated, with the population concentrated in riparian areas and cities."
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"In 1860, the enslaved Afro-American population numbered 436,631, or 55 per cent of the total State population, or 791,305 persons."
10834,23,mississippi,10834, Less than 1000 were people free of color.
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively small population of the State prior to the civil war reflects the fact that land and villages have only been developed along the banks of the river, which are the main transport corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836, Ninety per cent of the Delta's ground lands were still at the border and were not developed.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The state needs many more settlers to develop.
10838,23,mississippi,10838,The lands farther from the rivers were cleared by liberated men and white migrants during reconstruction and later.
10839,23,mississippi,10839,"On January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union and was one of the founding members of the Confederate States."
10840,23,mississippi,10840,The first six states to separate are those with the largest number of slaves.
10841,23,mississippi,10841," During the war, the forces of the Union and Confederation fought for domination over the Mississippi River, critical for supply routes and trade."
10842,23,mississippi,10842,"More than 80,000 Mississippians fought during the civil war, and the loss of life was extremely heavy."

10848,23,mississippi,10848,"In addition, independent black denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church (established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 19th century) and the African Methodist Episcopal Church of Zion (established in New York), sent missionaries to the South in the post-war years."
10849,23,mississippi,10849, They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the south.

10867,23,mississippi,10867," From 1874 to the election of 1875, they put pressure on whites to join the Democrats and lead violence against blacks in at least 15 known ""rioots"" in cities around the state to intimidate blacks."

11041,23,mississippi,11041,"The position of Mississippi as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton farming before and after the civil war, the late development of its border bottom lands in the Mississippi Delta, the repeated natural disasters of floods in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that required massive capital investment in the dikes, and the abandonment and depletion of the bottom lands, as well as the slow development of railways to connect the bottom cities and river towns."
11042,23,mississippi,11042," Moreover, when the Democrats regained control of the state legislature, they adopted the constitution of 1890, which discouraged the industrial development of enterprises in favour of rural agriculture, a legacy that would slow down the state's progress for years."

11068,23,mississippi,11068,"In addition, dependence on agriculture has become increasingly costly as the state suffered the loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the birch plough in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912-1913 and 1927, the collapse of cotton prices after 1920 and the drought in 1930."
11069,23,mississippi,11069,"It was not until 1884, after the flood of 1882, that the state created the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and began to successfully implement longer-term plans for levees in the upper delta."

11099,23,mississippi,11099," With Mississippi's tax conservatism, in which Medicaid, well-being, food stamps and other social programs are often reduced, eligibility conditions are strengthened and more stringent employment criteria are imposed, Mississippi ranks as having the second ratio between spending and tax revenues of any state."

11225,24,missouri,11225,"It seems to be folk etymology — Illinois spoke an Algonquian language and the closest approximation that can be made in that of their close neighbours, the Ojibwe, is ""You should go down and visit these people."""
11226,24,missouri,11226," This would be a strange event, because the French who first explored and tried to settle in Mississippi generally obtained their translations during this fairly precise period, often giving things French names that were exact translations of the native language(s)."
11227,24,missouri,11227," Assuming that Missouri derives from the Siwan language, it translates as ""it connects to its side"", with reference to the river itself."
11228,24,missouri,11228,"It is not quite probable either, because it would come out under the name ""Maya Sunni"" (Mah-yah soo-nee)."

11230,24,missouri,11230,"The name ""Missouri"" has several different pronunciations even among its natives of today, the two most common being (listening) miz-UR-ee and (listening) miz-UR-."

11239,24,missouri,11239, This sentence is of multiple origins.
11240,24,missouri,11240,"One is largely attributed to a speech by MP Willard Vandiver in 1899, who said that ""I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cocks and democrats, and the sparkling eloquence does not convince me or satisfy me."
11241,24,missouri,11241,"I'm from Missouri, and you have to show it to me."""
11242,24,missouri,11242,"It's in agreement with the saying ""I'm from Missouri,"" which means ""I'm skeptical about the issue and I'm not easily convinced."""
11243,24,missouri,11243," However, according to the researchers, the term ""show me"" was already used before the 1890s."
11244,24,missouri,11244," Another indicates that this is a reference to the Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado, to replace the workers on strike."
11245,24,missouri,11245," Since the new men were not familiar with mining methods, they needed frequent instruction."
11246,24,missouri,11246," Other nicknames for Missouri include ""The Lead State"", ""The State of Bullion"", ""The State of Ozark"", ""The Mother of the West"", ""The State of the Iron Mountain"", and ""Western Pennsylvania""."
11247,24,missouri,11247,"It is also known as the ""State of the cellar"" because there are more than 7,300 caves registered in the state (second in Tennessee)."

11254,24,missouri,11254," Yet they are known for their massive earth-moving mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platforms, peaks and conical forms."

11260,24,missouri,11260,"For most of the first half of the 1700s, the western shore of the Mississippi that was to become the Missouri was largely uninhabited, a land of no man who kept peace between Illinois on the east shore of Mississippi and north, and the Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley."
11261,24,missouri,11261,"In the early 1700s, French merchants and missionaries explored the entire Mississippi Valley, known as the Louisiana region.At the same time, a different group of French Canadians who established five villages on the east bank of Mississippi placed their colonies in Illinois, Illinois."

11269,24,missouri,11269,"The early villages of Missouri included many African and Amerindian slaves, and slave labour was at the heart of commercial agriculture and the fur trade."
11270,24,missouri,11270,"Sainte-Geneviève became a prosperous agricultural centre, producing enough surplus wheat, corn and tobacco to ship tons of grain annually to Lower Louisiana to trade there."
11271,24,missouri,11271, Grain production in Illinois was essential to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.
11272,24,missouri,11272,Saint-Louis was founded shortly afterwards by Pierre Laclède and the son-in-law Auguste Couteau de la Nouvelle-Orléans in 1764.
11273,24,missouri,11273," From 1764 to 1803, European control of the area west of Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri basin, known as Louisiana, was assumed by the Spaniards as part of the vice-royalty of New Spain, due to the Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order for Spain to join France in the war against England)."

11275,24,missouri,11275,"Saint-Louis became the centre of a regional fur trade with the Amerindian tribes that expanded the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades."
11276,24,missouri,11276,The trading partners of the large companies shipped their furs from Saint-Louis by river to New Orleans to export them to Europe.
11277,24,missouri,11277, They provided a variety of goods to traders for sale and trade with their Amerindian customers.
11278,24,missouri,11278,The fur trade and associated companies have made St. Louis an early financial centre and have provided wealth to some to build beautiful houses and import luxury goods.
11279,24,missouri,11279, Its location near the Illinois confluence meant that it also treated products from agricultural areas.
11280,24,missouri,11280,River traffic and trade along Mississippi were an integral part of the state economy.
11281,24,missouri,11281,"As the first major city in the region, Saint-Louis expanded considerably after the invention of the steamboat and the increase in river trade."
11282,24,missouri,11282, Napoleon Bonaparte had acquired Louisiana for the French property of Spain in 1800 under the treaty of San Ildefonso after it had been a Spanish colony since 1762.
11283,24,missouri,11283,But the treaty was kept secret.
11284,24,missouri,11284," Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France on 30 November 1803, just three weeks before the transfer to the United States."
11285,24,missouri,11285,"Part of the purchase of Louisiana by the United States in 1803, the Missouri won the nickname ""Porte de l'Ouest"" because it served as an important starting point for expeditions and settlers heading west during the 19th century."
11286,24,missouri,11286,"Saint-Charles, just west of Saint-Louis, was the starting point and return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which climbed on the Missouri River in 1804, to explore the lands from the west to the Pacific Ocean."
11287,24,missouri,11287,St. Louis was an important supply point for decades for settler parties heading west.
11288,24,missouri,11288,"As many of the early settlers of Western Missouri emigrated from the Upper South, they brought African-American slaves as agricultural workers, and they wanted to continue their culture and the institution of slavery."
11289,24,missouri,11289," They settled mainly in 17 counties along the Missouri River, in an area of plains that allowed plantation farming and became known as ""Petit Dixie""."
11290,24,missouri,11290,The state was shaken by earthquakes from 1811 to 1812.
11291,24,missouri,11291, There were few losses due to the sparse population.
11292,24,missouri,11292,"In 1821, the former territory of Missouri was admitted as a slave state, under the compromise of Missouri, and with a temporary state capital in Saint Charles."
11293,24,missouri,11293,"In 1826, the capital was moved to its current permanent location in Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River."
11294,24,missouri,11294," Originally the western boundary of the state was a straight line, defined as the meridian passing through Kawsmouth, the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River."
11295,24,missouri,11295," Since this designation, the river has moved."
11296,24,missouri,11296, This line is known as the Osage border.
11297,24,missouri,11297,"In 1836 the purchase of the Platte was added to the northwest corner of the state after the purchase of the lands of the native tribes, making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River."
11298,24,missouri,11298," This addition increased the area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to the 65,000 square miles of Virginia, which then included Western Virginia)."
11299,24,missouri,11299,"In the early 1830s, Mormon migrants from northern states and Canada began to settle near Independence and areas just north of the island."
11300,24,missouri,11300," Conflicts over religion and slavery have arisen between the ""former settlers"" (mainly from the South) and the Mormons (mainly from the North)."
11301,24,missouri,11301,The Mormon War broke out in 1838.
11302,24,missouri,11302,"In 1839, with the help of a ""order of extermination"" of Governor Lilburn Boggs, the former settlers forcibly expelled the Mormons of Missouri and confiscated their lands."
11303,24,missouri,11303, Conflicts over slavery exacerbated border tensions between States and territories.
11304,24,missouri,11304," From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with Iowa over what is known as Honey Lands led to the call of militias from both states along the border."
11305,24,missouri,11305," With the increase in migration between the 1830s and 1860s, the Missouri population almost doubled with every decade."
11306,24,missouri,11306," Most newcomers were born in the United States, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s."
11307,24,missouri,11307," Since the majority were Catholics, they created their own religious institutions in the state, most of which had been Protestants."
11308,24,missouri,11308," Many settled in the cities, creating a regional network and then a state network of Catholic churches and schools."
11309,24,missouri,11309,German immigrants from the 19th century created the wine industry along Missouri and the beer industry in Saint-Louis.
11310,24,missouri,11310," While many German immigrants were strongly anti-slavery, many Irish immigrants living in cities were pro-slavery, fearing that the liberation of African-American slaves would create a mass of unskilled labour, thereby lowering wages."
11311,24,missouri,11311, Most farmers in Missouri were engaged in subsistence farming before the American Civil War.
11312,24,missouri,11312,The majority of those who were slaves had fewer than five people each.
11313,24,missouri,11313," Planters, defined by some historians as those holding about 20 or more slaves, were concentrated in the counties known as ""Little Dixie"" in the central part of the state along the Missouri River."
11314,24,missouri,11314,Tensions about slavery relate primarily to the future of the State and the nation.
11315,24,missouri,11315,"In 1860, Afro-American enslaved persons accounted for less than 10% of the state population, or 1,182,012."
11316,24,missouri,11316,"To control the flooding of agricultural land and low-lying villages along Mississippi, the state had completed the construction of 230 kilometres of dykes along the river in 1860."
11317,24,missouri,11317," After the secession of the southern states began in 1861, the parliament of Missouri advocated the election of a special convention on secession."
11318,24,missouri,11318,Pro-South Governor Claiborne F. Jackson ordered the mobilization of several hundred members of the state militia who had gathered in a camp in Saint-Louis to train.
11319,24,missouri,11319," Alarmed by this act, the General Union Nathaniel Lyon strikes first, encircling the camp and forcing the troops of the state to surrender."
11320,24,missouri,11320,"Lyon directed its soldiers, largely non-English-speaking German immigrants, to walk the prisoners through the streets, and they opened fire on the widely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them."
11321,24,missouri,11321," Soldiers killed unarmed prisoners as well as men, women and children from Saint-Louis in the incident known as the Massacre de Saint-Louis."
11322,24,missouri,11322, These events have increased confederate support within the state.
11323,24,missouri,11323," Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price, president of the Secession Convention, to head the new Missouri State Guard."
11324,24,missouri,11324,"In the face of the rapid advance of the Lyon General Union across the state, Jackson and Price were forced to flee the capital of Jefferson City on 14 June 1861."

11339,24,missouri,11339,"The legal activities of the Bald Knobbers of the Ozarks in the 1880s were an unofficial continuation of the insurgent mentality long after the official end of the war, and they are a favorite theme in Branson's image."

11376,24,missouri,11376," Although it is now generally considered to be part of the Midwest, Missouri has always been regarded by many as a border state, mainly because of the establishment of migrants from the South and its status as a slave state before the civil war, in balance with the influence of Saint-Louis."

11651,25,montana,11651, Montana is a state in the northwestern United States of America.
11652,25,montana,11652,"It is bordered by Idaho to the west; North Dakota and South Dakota to the east; Wyoming to the south; and by the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan to the north."
11653,25,montana,11653,"It is the fourth largest state by region, the eighth least populated, and the third least dense."
11654,25,montana,11654,"The western half of Montana contains many mountain ranges, while half is characterized by prairie terrain and western badlands, with more (although smaller) mountain ranges throughout the state."
11655,25,montana,11655,A total of 77 designated ranges are in the Rocky Mountains.
11656,25,montana,11656," Montana has no official nickname, but several unofficial names, including ""Big Sky Country"", ""The Treasure State"", ""Land of the Shining Mountains"", and ""The Last Best Place""."
11657,25,montana,11657,"The economy is mainly based on agriculture, including livestock and cereal farming."
11658,25,montana,11658," Other important economic resources include oil, gas, coal, mining and lumber."
11659,25,montana,11659,"The health care, service and government sectors are also important to the state economy."
11660,25,montana,11660,"The fastest growing area in Montana is tourism, with nearly 13 million annual tourists visiting Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Beartooth Highway, Flathead Lake, Big Sky Resort and other attractions."
11661,25,montana,11661,"The name Montana comes from the Spanish word montaña, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, meaning ""mountain"" or more widely ""mountainous land""."
11662,25,montana,11662,Montaña del Norte is the name given by the first Spanish explorers to the entire western mountainous region.
11663,25,montana,11663,The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill of the United States House Committee on Territories (then chaired by James Ashley of Ohio) for the territory that would become the territory of Idaho.
11664,25,montana,11664,"The name was changed by representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained Montana had ""no meaning."""
11665,25,montana,11665," When Ashley introduced a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be dug from Idaho, he again chose the territory of Montana."
11666,25,montana,11666," This time, Samuel Cox, also from Ohio, opposed the name."
11667,25,montana,11667,Cox complained that the name was a bad name since most of the territory was not mountainous and an Amerindian name would be more appropriate than a Spanish name.
11668,25,montana,11668," Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but the Territorial Committee decided that they could appoint it as they wished, so that the original name of Montana had been adopted."
11669,25,montana,11669," Montana is one of eight mountain states, located in the northern part of the region known as the Western United States."
11670,25,montana,11670,It is bordered by North Dakota and South Dakota to the east.
11671,25,montana,11671,"Wyoming is to the south, Idaho to the west and south-west, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan are to the north, making it the only state bordering three Canadian provinces."
11672,25,montana,11672," With an area of 147,040 square miles (380,800 km2), Montana is a little larger than Japan."

11674,25,montana,11674,"The topography of the state is roughly defined by the continental division, which divides much of the state into distinct regions of the east and west."
11675,25,montana,11675," Most of the hundreds of mountain ranges in Montana are in the western half of the state, most of which are geologically and geographically located in northern Rocky Mountains."
11676,25,montana,11676,The Absaroka and Beartooth chains in the southern central part of the state are technically part of the Central Rocky Mountains.
11677,25,montana,11677,The Rocky Mountain Front is an important feature of the north-central part of the state and of isolated island chains that interrupt the common prairie landscape in central and eastern parts of the state.
11678,25,montana,11678," About 60 percent of the state is a prairie, which is part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains, one of the longest continuous chains of the Alaska Mountain Range in Mexico, as well as smaller chains, including the Alene Heart Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the state of Idaho."
11680,25,montana,11680,The southern third of Bitterroot's range melts into the continental ditch.
11681,25,montana,11681," Other major mountain ranges west of the fracture include the Cabinet Mountains, Anaconda Range, Missions, Garnet Range, Sapphire Mountains and Flint Creek Range."
11682,25,montana,11682,"The northern section of the ditch, where the mountains quickly gave way to the prairies, was part of the Rocky Front."
11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is the most prominent in the Lewis Range, located primarily in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684," Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (which begins on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska) crosses this area and turns east into Montana at Triple Divide Peak."
11685,25,montana,11685,"It runs the Waterton, Belly and Saint Mary rivers northward in Alberta, Canada."
11686,25,montana,11686," They join the Saskatchewan River, which eventually flows into Hudson Bay."
11687,25,montana,11687,"To the east of the fracture, several roughly parallel ranges cover the southern part of the state, including the Gravelly Range, the Madison Range, the Gallatin Range, the Absaroka Mountains and the Beartooth Mountains."
11688,25,montana,11688,"The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass of more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) high in the American continent."
11689,25,montana,11689,"It contains the highest point of the state, Granite Peak, 12,799 feet (3,901 m) high."
11690,25,montana,11690,"To the north of these chains are the great mountains of the belt, the Bridger Mountains, the tobacco roots and several island chains, including the Crazy Mountains and Little Belt."
11691,25,montana,11691, Between many mountain ranges there are rich river valleys.
11692,25,montana,11692,"The Big Hole Valley, the Bitterroot Valley, the Gallatin Valley, the Flathead Valley and the Paradise Valley have vast agricultural resources and many opportunities for tourism and recreation."
11693,25,montana,11693,"To the east and north of this transition zone are the large and sparsely populated northern plains, with plains, small island mountain ranges and badlands."
11694,25,montana,11694,"The isolated islands east of Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains, the Bull Mountains, the Castle Mountains, the Crazy Mountains, the Highwood Mountains, the Judith Mountains, the Little Belt Mountains, the Little Rocky Mountains, the Pryor Mountains, the Little Snowy Mountains, the Big Snowy Mountains, the Sweet Grass Hills and, in the southeast corner of the state near Ekalaka, the Long Pines."
11695,25,montana,11695, Many of these isolated areas were created about 120 to 66 million years ago when the magma ripped out from the inside and prostrated in front of the earth's surface here.
11696,25,montana,11696,The area east of the division in the north-central part of the state is known for the Missouri Breaks and other major rock formations.
11697,25,montana,11697," Three mounds south of Great Falls are important landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw and Buttes."
11698,25,montana,11698," Known as laccoliths, they form when the igneous rock passes through cracks in the sedimentary rock."
11699,25,montana,11699,The underlying surface consists of sandstone and shale.
11700,25,montana,11700,"The area's surface soils are very diverse and heavily affected by local geology, whether they are glazed plains, intermountain basins, mountain foothills or plateaus."
11701,25,montana,11701,"The regions of the foothills are often covered with broken stones or slates, or consist of bare rocks discovered (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil in the intermountain basins generally consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt and volcanic ash, much of which was made up of lakes that covered the area during the oligocene 33-23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"The trays are often surmounted by argillite gravel and weather quartzite, sometimes under the shale."
11704,25,montana,11704,"The glaciated plains are generally covered with clay, gravel, sand and silt left by Great Falls Proglacial Lake or by moraines or old lake basins covered with gravel left by Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago."
11705,25,montana,11705," Further east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka are home to some of the most picturesque areas of the state."
11706,25,montana,11706,The Hell Creek Formation in northeast Montana is a major source of dinosaur fossils.
11707,25,montana,11707,The paleontologist Jack Horner of the Bozeman Rockies Museum brought this training to the attention of the world with several major discoveries.

11711,25,montana,11711, where two continental divisions intersect).
11712,25,montana,11712," Its rivers feed the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay."
11713,25,montana,11713,The watersheds are divided at Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park.
11714,25,montana,11714," While Hudson Bay is considered to be part of the Arctic Ocean, Triple Divide Peak is the only place on Earth where there are three different oceans."
11715,25,montana,11715,"All the waters of Montana, west of the divided stream, flow into the Columbia River."
11716,25,montana,11716,"The Columbia Clark fork (not to be confused with the Clarks fork of the Yellowstone River) rises near Butte and flows northwest to Missoula, where it is joined by the Blackfoot River and the Bitterroot River."
11717,25,montana,11717," Further downstream, it is joined by the Flathead River before entering Idaho near Lake Pend Oreille."
11718,25,montana,11718,The Pend Oreille River forms the flow out of Pend Oreille Lake.
11719,25,montana,11719,"The Pend Oreille River joins the Columbia River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean, making the Clark Fork/Pend Oreille River, 932 km long, the longest of the Rocky Mountains."
11720,25,montana,11720,The Clark fork discharges the largest volume of water from any river coming out of the state.
11721,25,montana,11721,"The Kootenai River, northwest of Montana, is another major tributary of Colombia."
11722,25,montana,11722,"East of the Missouri River division, formed by the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison and Gallatin rivers near Three Forks, flows northward through the central western part of the state to Great Falls."
11723,25,montana,11723," From this point, it usually flows eastward through fairly flat farmland and the Missouri breaks to the Fort Peck reservoir."
11724,25,montana,11724,"The portion of the river between Fort Benton and the Fred Robinson Bridge, at the western boundary of the Fort Peck Reservoir, was designated Wild and Scenic River in 1976."
11725,25,montana,11725,Missouri enters North Dakota near Fort Union after draining more than half of Montana's surface (82 000 square miles (210 000 km2)).
11726,25,montana,11726," Nearly a third of the Missouri River in Montana lies behind 10 dams: Toston, Canyon Ferry, Hauser, Holter, Black Eagle, Rainbow, Cochrane, Ryan, Morony and Fort Peck."

11728,25,montana,11728,"The Montana also claims the disputed title of possession of the world's shortest river, the Roe River, just outside Great Falls."
11729,25,montana,11729,"By the Missouri, these rivers finally reach the Mississippi River and flow into the Gulf of Mexico."
11730,25,montana,11730,"Hell Roaring Creek begins in southern Montana, and when combined with Red Rock, Beaverhead, Jefferson, Missouri and Mississippi, it is the longest river in North America and the fourth longest river in the world."
11731,25,montana,11731,The Yellowstone River rises on the continental ditch near the top of the yuntas in the nature of Wyoming Teton.
11732,25,montana,11732,"It crosses Yellowstone National Park to the north, entering Montana near Gardiner and crossing the Paradise Valley to Livingston."
11733,25,montana,11733,"It then flows northeast through the state through Billings, Miles City, Glendive and Sidney."
11734,25,montana,11734,Yellowstone joined Missouri in North Dakota east of Fort Union.
11735,25,montana,11735,"It is the longest undamaged open river in the United States, draining about a quarter of Montana (36,000 square miles (93,000 km2))."
11736,25,montana,11736,"The main tributaries of Yellowstone are the Boulder, Stillwater, Clarks Fork, Bighorn, Tongue and Powder rivers."
11737,25,montana,11737,"The Northern Divide turns east at Montana at Triple Divide Peak, causing the Waterton, Belly and Saint Mary rivers to flow north to Alberta."

11766,25,montana,11766," Montana is a large state with considerable variations in geography, topography and altitude, and the climate is therefore equally varied."
11767,25,montana,11767,"The state extends from the bottom of the 45th parallel (the equidistant line between the equator and the North Pole) to the 49th parallel, with altitudes ranging from less than 2,000 feet (610 m) to nearly 13,000 feet (4,000 m) above sea level."
11768,25,montana,11768,"The western half is mountainous, interrupted by several large valleys."
11769,25,montana,11769,"The eastern Montana includes plains and badlands, fragmented by isolated hills and mountain ranges, and has a semi-arid and continental climate (Köppen BSk climate classification)."
11770,25,montana,11770,"The continental ditch has a considerable effect on the climate, as it limits the warmer air flow in the Pacific from the east, and the drier continental air from the west."
11771,25,montana,11771,"The area west of the ditch has a modified climate on the Pacific North Coast, with milder winters, cooler summers, less wind and a longer growing season."
11772,25,montana,11772," Low clouds and fog often form in the valleys west of the division in winter, but this is rarely seen to the east."
11773,25,montana,11773, Average daytime temperatures vary from 28°F or -2.2°C in January to 84.5°F or 29.2°C in July.
11774,25,montana,11774,The variation in geography results in a large variation in temperature.
11775,25,montana,11775,The highest observed summer temperature was 117°F or 47.2°C at Glendive on 20 July 1893 and at Medicine Lake on 5 July 1937.

11781,25,montana,11781," Temperatures vary considerably on cold nights, and Helena, at 64 km to the southeast, experienced only a low of -36°F or -37.8°C on the same date, and a record historical record of -42°F or -41.1°C."
11782,25,montana,11782,Winter cold spells are usually the result of cold continental air coming from southern Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The forehead is often well defined, resulting in a significant drop in temperature in 24 hours."
11784,25,montana,11784," Conversely, the southwestern airflow translates into ""chinooks""."
11785,25,montana,11785," These stable winds from 25 to 50 mph (40 to 80 km/h) (or more) can suddenly warm up parts of Montana, especially areas just east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise to 50 to 60 degrees F (10 to 15.6 degrees Celsius) for 10 days or more."
11786,25,montana,11786,Loma is the site of the most extreme temperature change recorded in a 24-hour period in the United States.
11787,25,montana,11787,"On 15 January 1972, a chinook wind blows and the temperature rises from -54°F to 49°F (−47.8°C to 9.4°C)."
11788,25,montana,11788," Average annual precipitation is 15 inches (380 mm), but large variations are observed."
11789,25,montana,11789,"The mountain ranges block the damp air of the Pacific, maintaining moisture in the western valleys and creating rain shadows to the east."
11790,25,montana,11790,"Heron, in the west, receives the most precipitation, 34.70 inches (881 mm)."
11791,25,montana,11791,"On the east side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches (291 mm) and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation."
11792,25,montana,11792,"The mountains can receive more than 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park receives 105 inches (2,700 mm)."
11793,25,montana,11793,An area southwest of Belfry averaged 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a 16-year period.
11794,25,montana,11794, Most large cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year.
11795,25,montana,11795,Mountain ranges can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow during the winter.
11796,25,montana,11796," Heavy snowstorms can occur from September to May, although most snowfall occurs from November to March."
11797,25,montana,11797,The climate has become warmer in Montana and continues to do so.
11798,25,montana,11798,Glacier National Park glaciers have receded and are expected to collapse completely in a few decades.
11799,25,montana,11799," Several cities in Montana recorded heat records in July 2007, the warmest month ever recorded in Montana."
11800,25,montana,11800,Winters are also warmer and have fewer cold spells.
11801,25,montana,11801," Previously, these cold spells had killed the beetles, but they are now attacking the forests of western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the area allowed various species to expand their range and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, beetle attack and poor management has resulted in a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804," According to a study by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some parts of Montana will experience a 200 per cent increase in the area burned by forest fires and an 80 per cent increase in related air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below lists the average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month for the seven largest cities in Montana.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on the location, although the figures are generally similar."
11807,25,montana,11807, Montana is one of only two contiguous states (with Colorado) that are antipodal on land.
11808,25,montana,11808,The Kerguelen Islands are antipodal to the Montana/Saskatchewan/Alberta border.
11809,25,montana,11809,"No city is precisely antipodes to Kerguelen, although Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples have lived in the territory of the present State of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811," Historical tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers in the United States included the Crow in the south-central, Cheyenne in the southeast, Blackfeet, Assiniboine and Gros Ventres in the north-central and central, and Kootenai and Salish in the west."
11812,25,montana,11812,"The smallest Pend d'Oreille and Kalispel tribes lived near Flathead Lake and the western mountains, respectively."

11814,25,montana,11814,"The lands of Montana, east of the continental division, were part of the purchase of Louisiana in 1803."
11815,25,montana,11815," After and especially in the decades following the Lewis and Clark expeditions, American, British and French traders operated a fur trade, usually working with Aboriginal peoples, both in the eastern and western parts of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816," These transactions have not always been peaceful, and although the fur trade has brought material gain to indigenous tribal groups, it has also exposed European diseases and altered their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The trading post Fort Raymond (1807–11) was built in the Indian country of Crow in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818," Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), the lands west of the continental division were disputed between the British and the United States and were known as Oregon countries."
11819,25,montana,11819,"The first permanent establishment by the Euro-Americans in what is today Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near Stevensville, today."
11820,25,montana,11820,In 1847 Fort Benton became the highest fur trade post on the Missouri River.
11821,25,montana,11821,"In the 1850s, settlers began to settle in the Beaverhead and Big Hole valleys from the Oregon Trail and the Clark Fork Valley."
11822,25,montana,11822,"The first gold discovered in Montana was at Gold Creek, near the present garrison in 1852."
11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state from 1862 onward found gold, silver, copper, lead and coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area."
11824,25,montana,11824,"The richest of all gold placer digs was discovered in Alder Gulch, where the city of Virginia City was established."
11825,25,montana,11825," Other rich placer deposits have been found in Last Chance Gulch, now home to the city of Helen, Confederate Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City."
11826,25,montana,11826,Gold production from 1862 to 1876 amounted to $144 million
11827,25,montana,11827,"The largest mining operations were in the city of Butte, which had huge deposits of silver and copper."
11828,25,montana,11828," Prior to the creation of Montana (1864–89), the present-day Montana areas were part of Oregon (1848–59), Washington (1853–63), Idaho (1863–64) and Dakota (1861–64)."
11829,25,montana,11829, Montana became an American territory (Montana Territory) on 26 May 1864.
11830,25,montana,11830,The first territorial capital is in Bannack.

11834,25,montana,11834,"The Montana Historical Society, founded on February 2, 1865 in Virginia City, is the oldest such institution west of Mississippi (except Louisiana)."
11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870 respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and Washburn–Langford–Doane expeditions were launched from Helen into the Upper Yellowstone area and led directly to the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As settlers began to populate Montana between the 1850s and 1870s, disputes ensued with the Amerindians, mainly over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, the territorial governor of Washington, Isaac Stevens, negotiated the Hellgate Treaty between the U.S. government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille and the Kootenai people of western Montana, which established boundaries for tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838,The treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839," While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reserve, difficulty with the interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led Whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was open to colonization, but tribal nations challenged these provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first U.S. Army post in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect the traffic of steamboats travelling to Fort Benton."
11842,25,montana,11842,More than a dozen additional military posts have been established in the state.
11843,25,montana,11843, Pressure on land ownership and control has increased as a result of gold discoveries in various parts of Montana and surrounding states.
11844,25,montana,11844,"Major battles took place in Montana during the Red Cloud War, the Great Sioux War of 1876 and the Nez Perce War and in the conflicts with Piegan Blackfeet."

11846,25,montana,11846,The last conflict in Montana between the American army and the Amerindians occurred in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in Big Horn's country.
11847,25,montana,11847,Survivors of Indians who have signed treaties are generally required to make reservations.
11848,25,montana,11848," Along with these conflicts, the bison, a key arch species and the main source of proteins on which Aboriginal people had survived for centuries, were destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849," According to some estimates, more than 13 million bison were in Montana in 1870."
11850,25,montana,11850,"In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded for a joint session of Congress to authorize the slaughter of herds in order to deprive the Indians of their food source."

11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle farming has been at the heart of Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and exchanged fattened cattle in fertile Montana valleys with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.
11853,25,montana,11853,Nelson Story introduced Texas Longhorn's first cattle into the Territory in 1866.
11854,25,montana,11854,"Granville Stuart, Samuel Hauser and Andrew J. Davis began a large open-area livestock operation in Fergus County in 1879."
11855,25,montana,11855,The Ranch Grant-Kohrs National Historic Site at Deer Lodge is maintained today as a link to the late 19th-century ranch style.
11856,25,montana,11856,"Operated by the National Parks Service, it is a 1,900-acre ranch (7.7 km2)."
11857,25,montana,11857,The tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad (NPR) reached Montana from the west in 1881 and from the east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858," However, in the 1870s, the railway played a leading role in tensions with Amerindian tribes."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, president of the NPR, launched important surveys in the Yellowstone Valley in 1871, 1872 and 1873, which the Sioux strongly challenged under the leadership of Chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860," These clashes, in part, contributed to the panic of 1873, a financial crisis that delayed the construction of the railway in Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"Surveys conducted in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped trigger the Great Sioux War in 1876."

11863,25,montana,11863,"The Grand Chemin de fer du Nord (GNR) tracks reached the east of Montana in 1887 and, when they reached the north of the Rocky Mountains in 1890, the GNR became a major tourism promoter in the Glacier National Park area."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893, at Scenic, Washington State."
11865,25,montana,11865,"In 1881 the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch line of the Pacific Union, completed a narrow line from northern Utah to Butte."

11867,25,montana,11867," Under the authority of territorial governor Thomas Meagher, the Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 as part of a unsuccessful attempt to become a state."
11868,25,montana,11868,"A second constitutional convention, held in Helena in 1884, produced a constitution ratified 3:1 by the citizens of Montana in November 1884."
11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress only approved state status in Montana in February 1889, and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting state status in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington after the appropriate state constitutions had been drafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,"In July 1889, the Montanas convened their third constitutional assembly and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government."

11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land for settlers who could claim and ""proven"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875, Montana did not see a large influx of immigrants under the Act because 160 acres were usually insufficient to support a family in arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,"In 1868 David Carpenter, near Helen, made the first claim under the deed of ownership in Montana."
11877,25,montana,11877,"The first claim by a woman was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana pioneer, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"In 1880, the farms were in the greener valleys of central and western Montana, but few were in the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Lands Act of 1877 was adopted to permit the settlement of arid lands in the west and awarded 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a $25 per acre price and a promise of irrigation of the land.
11880,25,montana,11880," After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would be the property of the colon."
11881,25,montana,11881," This law brought most of the cattle and sheep farmers to Montana, many of whom took their herds to the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land, and then abandoned it without paying the final costs."
11882,25,montana,11882," Some farmers arrived with the arrival of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railways in the 1880s and 1890s, albeit in relatively small numbers."
11883,25,montana,11883,In the early 1900s James J. Hill of the Great North began to promote settlement on the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods.
11884,25,montana,11884, Other railways followed.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the law on rehabilitation was adopted, allowing the construction of irrigation projects in the river valleys of Montana."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909 Congress passed the Extended Houses Act, which extended the area of free land from 160 acres to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family, and in 1912 reduced the time to ""proven"" a claim to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Homesteads Act allowed 640 acres of homesteads in areas unsuitable for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888," This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of landowners, attracted to free land, with the First World War bringing particularly high wheat prices."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana was experiencing a temporary period of above-average precipitation."
11890,25,montana,11890,"The owners arriving at this time were known as ""Honyockers"" or ""scissors""."
11891,25,montana,11891," Although the word ""honyocker"", perhaps derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisory way to the owners as ""green horns"", ""new to his business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had agricultural experience, although many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892," However, farmers have faced a number of problems."
11893,25,montana,11893,It was a massive debt.
11894,25,montana,11894,"In addition, most settlers came from wetter areas, unprepared for dry climate, lack of trees and scarcity of water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small homes of less than 320 acres (130 ha) were not suitable for the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896, Weather and agricultural conditions are much harsher and drier west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897," Then, the droughts of 1917-1921 proved devastating."
11898,25,montana,11898," Many people left, and half of the state's banks went bankrupt as a result of the provision of mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, the size of holdings has increased and the number of holdings has decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"In 1910, the owners filed claims on more than five million acres and in 1923, more than 93 million acres were cultivated."
11901,25,montana,11901,"By 1910, the Great Falls Land Office alone had more than a thousand property deposits per month, and at the top of 1917-1918, it had 14,000 each year."
11902,25,montana,11902, Significant falls occurred as a result of the 1919 drought.
11903,25,montana,11903,"At the beginning of World War I, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States declaration of war."
11904,25,montana,11904," His actions were widely criticized in Montana, where support for war and patriotism were strong."
11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917–18, due to a miscalculation of the Montana population, approximately 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the state population, volunteered or were recruited into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906, This represented a contribution of labour to war that was 25 per cent higher than that of any other state on a per capita basis.
11907,25,montana,11907," About 1500 Montanians died as a result of the war and 2437 were injured, as well as more than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908," Montana Remount Station in Miles City provided 10,000 horse cavalry horses for the war, more than any other Army post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for Montana's mining, forestry and agricultural interests as the demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the American Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the 1918 Sedition Act."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Montana Legislative Assembly passed the Montana Sedition Act, which is a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912,"In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, the army, or symbols by speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana Act had led to the arrest of more than 200 persons and the conviction of 78 persons, mainly of German or Austrian origin."
11914,25,montana,11914,More than 40 people spent time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, Governor Brian Schweitzer granted full posthumously pardons to all those found guilty of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed the entry of the United States into the war included groups of German and Irish immigrants, as well as pacifist anabaptists such as the Hutterites and Mennonites, many of whom were also Germanic."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-war groups such as the Montana Defence Council, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and local ""loyalty committees""."
11918,25,montana,11918,The feeling of war was complicated by work problems.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The Anaconda Copper Company, which was at its historic peak in copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and unions that struggle to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multi-ethnic community of major European immigrants, trade unions, in particular the new Metal Mining Workers' Union, opposed the war on the grounds that they mostly benefited from major interests in the softwood lumber and mining sector."
11921,25,montana,11921," Following the explosion of mining production and the speculator mine disaster in June 1917, Frank Little, a world organizer of industrial workers, arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave a few speeches with an incendiary antiwar rhetoric.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On 1 August 1917, he was dragged from his boarding school by masked vigilantes, and hanged on a railway lattice, considered a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,The murder of Little and the subsequent strikes led to the dispatch of the National Guard to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925," Overall, anti-German and anti-labor sentiment increased and created a movement that led to the adoption of the Montana sedition law the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Defence Council has become a State body empowered to prosecute and punish persons deemed to be in violation of the law."
11927,25,montana,11927,The Council has also adopted rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting German speaking in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"In the wake of the legislative action of 1918, emotions rose."
11929,25,montana,11929,U.S. prosecutor Burton K. Wheeler and several district court judges who were reluctant to prosecute or convict accused persons were strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930," Wheeler was brought before the Defence Council, although he avoided formal proceedings, and a judge of the Forsyth District Court was indicted."
11931,25,montana,11931,Burns of German-speaking books and several quasi-hangings occurred.
11932,25,montana,11932,The ban on German speaking remained in force in the early 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Complementing the struggles in times of war, the 1918 influenza epidemic claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanians."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that occurred led some historians to dub this period ""the agony of Montana""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after World War I and lasted during the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936," This has caused enormous difficulties for farmers, farmers and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937," Wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state a major producer; wheat has a relatively high protein content, which requires high prices."
11938,25,montana,11938," When the United States entered the Second World War on December 8, 1941, many Montanas enlisted in the army to escape the bad national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Over 40,000 Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war and more than 57,000 joined before the end of the war."
11940,25,montana,11940," These figures represented about 10 per cent of the population of the state, and Montana again provided one of the highest numbers of soldiers per capita in any state."
11941,25,montana,11941," Many Amerindians were among those who served, including Crow Nation soldiers who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,At least 1500 Montanians died during the war.

11947,25,montana,11947,"In 1941, as it did in 1917, she voted against the United States declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
11948,25,montana,11948," His was the only vote against the war, and following a public outcry over his vote, Rankin asked for police protection for some time."
11949,25,montana,11949," Other pacifists tended to be those of the ""Churches of Peace"" who were generally opposed to war."
11950,25,montana,11950, Many people claiming conscientious objector status from across the United States were sent to Montana during the war as twins of smoke and for other tasks of fighting forest fires.
11951,25,montana,11951,"In 1942, the U.S. Army established Camp Rimini near Helen to train sled dogs in winter weather."
11952,25,montana,11952," During the Second World War, the planned USMontana warship was appointed in honor of the State, but it was never completed."
11953,25,montana,11953, Montana is the only one of the first 48 states that do not have a full warship to be named after it.
11954,25,montana,11954, Both Alaska and Hawaii have nuclear submarines named after them.
11955,25,montana,11955, Montana is the only state of union without a modern naval ship named in his honour.
11956,25,montana,11956," However, in August 2007, Senator Jon Tester requested that a submarine be named US Montana."
11957,25,montana,11957," Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced on September 3, 2015 that the Virginia class SSN-794 submarine would become the second warship to bear this name."

12595,27,nevada,12595,"On 2 March 1861 the territory of Nevada separated from the territory of Utah and adopted its present name, abbreviated from the Sierra Nevada (Spanish for ""snowy mountain range"")."
12596,27,nevada,12596,The southern boundary of 1861 is commemorated by the historical markers of Nevada 57 and 58 in the counties of Lincoln and Nye.
12597,27,nevada,12597," Eight days before the presidential election of 1864, Nevada became the 36th state of the Union, despite the absence of the minimum requirement of 60,000 inhabitants to become a state."
12598,27,nevada,12598,"(At the time, the population of Nevada was just over 10,000.)"
12599,27,nevada,12599," Rather than sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27 – the most expensive telegraph on file at the time for a single shipment."
12600,27,nevada,12600," Finally, Washington's response came on October 31, 1864: ""the pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day has been admitted into the Union""."
12601,27,nevada,12601,"The state was rushed to 31 October to help secure the re-election of Abraham Lincoln on 8 November and Republican domination after the civil war in Congress, as the Nevada mining economy linked him to the more industrialized Union."
12602,27,nevada,12602,"As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the elections hand in hand and did not need Nevada's help."
12603,27,nevada,12603, Nevada is one of the only two states to extend its borders considerably after its admission to the Union.
12604,27,nevada,12604,"(The other is Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the purchase of the Platte.)"
12605,27,nevada,12605,"In 1866, another part of the territory of western Utah was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the State, setting the current eastern border."
12606,27,nevada,12606," Nevada reached its current southern boundary on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the part of Pah-Ute County in Arizona territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of the present Nevada south of the 37th parallel."
12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was caused by the discovery of gold in the region, and officials thought that Nevada would be better able to monitor the projected population boom."
12608,27,nevada,12608, This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12609,27,nevada,12609, Mining has shaped the Nevada economy for many years (see Silver Mining in Nevada).
12610,27,nevada,12610," When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It, mining had led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth."
12611,27,nevada,12611, Both mining and population declined temporarily at the end of the 19th century.
12612,27,nevada,12612," However, the rich silver strike in Tonopah in 1900, followed by strikes in Goldfield and Rhyolite, created a second mining boom in Nevada and the population of Nevada."
12613,27,nevada,12613,"Unregulated gambling was common in the early mining towns of Nevada, but was banned in 1909 as part of a national anti-gambling crusade."
12614,27,nevada,12614," Due to the subsequent declines in mining production and the decline in the agricultural sector during the Great Depression, Nevada again legalized the game on March 19, 1931, with the approval of the legislature."
12615,27,nevada,12615, Governor Fred B. Balzar's signature promulgated the most liberal laws on divorce in the country and open gambling.
12616,27,nevada,12616,The reforms took place only eight days after the federal government presented the $49 million construction contract for the Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam).
12617,27,nevada,12617,"The Nevada Test Site, 105 km northwest of the city of Las Vegas, was founded on January 11, 1951 for nuclear weapons testing."
12618,27,nevada,12618,"The site consists of approximately 1,350 square miles (3,500 square kilometres) of desert and mountainous terrain."
12619,27,nevada,12619," Nuclear tests at the Nevada test site began with a 1 kiloton bomb of TNT (4.2 TJ) dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951."
12620,27,nevada,12620,"The last atmospheric test took place on 17 July 1962, and underground weapons tests continued until 23 September 1992."
12621,27,nevada,12621,The location is known to have the highest concentration of nuclear weapons detonated in the United States
12622,27,nevada,12622,More than 80 per cent of the state area is owned by the federal government.
12623,27,nevada,12623,The main reason for this is that homesteads have not been allowed in sufficient size to be viable under the arid conditions prevailing throughout the Nevada desert.
12624,27,nevada,12624," Instead, the first settlers would house land surrounding a water source and then graze cattle on adjacent public lands, which is unnecessary for agriculture without access to water (this model of livestock farming still prevails)."
12625,27,nevada,12625,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of Nevada was 3,080,156 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 45,764 residents (1.51%) since the 2018 U.S. Census estimate and an increase of 379,605 residents (14.06 per cent) since the 2010 U.S. Census."
12626,27,nevada,12626, Nevada recorded the highest population growth from 2017 to 2018.
12627,27,nevada,12627,"As of the 2010 census, 6.9 per cent of the population of the State was under the age of 5, 24.6 per cent under the age of 18 and 12 per cent over the age of 65."
12628,27,nevada,12628,Women made up about 49.5 per cent of the population.
12629,27,nevada,12629," Since the 2010 census, the population of Nevada has seen a natural increase of 87,581 people (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 people (of whom 104,032 are due to internal migration and 42,594 due to international migration)."
12630,27,nevada,12630,The population centre of Nevada is in southern Nye County.
12631,27,nevada,12631,"In this county, the unincorporated city of Pahrump, 97 km west of Las Vegas on the California state line, grew very rapidly from 1980 to 2010."
12632,27,nevada,12632,"As of the 2010 census, there were 36,441 residents in the city."
12633,27,nevada,12633," Las Vegas grew from a mulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1970 and was America's most dynamic city and metropolitan area from 1960 to 2000."
12634,27,nevada,12634," Between the 1940s and 2003, Nevada was the fastest growing state in the United States."
12635,27,nevada,12635," Between 1990 and 2000, the population of Nevada increased by 66 per cent, while the population of the country increased by 13 per cent."
12636,27,nevada,12636,"More than two thirds of the population live in Clark County, which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12637,27,nevada,12637," Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states of the nation."
12638,27,nevada,12638,"Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the top 20 fastest growing cities in the United States with more than 100,000 inhabitants."
12639,27,nevada,12639,"The rural community of Mesquite, 105 km northeast of Las Vegas, was an example of micropolitan growth in the 1990s and 2000s."
12640,27,nevada,12640, Other desert cities such as Indian Springs and Searchlight on the outskirts of Las Vegas have also seen some growth.
12641,27,nevada,12641," Since 1950, the Nevada-born population rate has never exceeded 27 per cent, the lowest of all states."
12642,27,nevada,12642,"In 2012, only 25% of Nevadas were born in the state."
12643,27,nevada,12643," Most of the new residents of Nevada have moved from California, which has led some Nevadas to feel that their condition is ""californicized."""
12644,27,nevada,12644," According to the 2017 U.S. Community Survey, 28.2% of the population of Nevada were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (21.4%), Puerto Rican (0.9%), Cuban (1.0%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (4.8%)."
12645,27,nevada,12645,"The five largest groups of non-Hispanic white ancestry were German (11.3%), Irish (9.0%), English (6.9%), Italian (5.8%) and American (4.7%)."
12646,27,nevada,12646,"In 1980, non-Hispanic whites made up 83.3% of the state population."
12647,27,nevada,12647,"In 2011, 63.6 per cent of the population of Nevada under the age of 1 were minorities."
12648,27,nevada,12648, Las Vegas is a minority city.
12649,27,nevada,12649," According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, as of 1 July 2018, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 48.7% of Nevada's population."
12650,27,nevada,12650,"In the counties of Douglas, Mineral and Pershing, a plurality of residents are of Mexican origin."

12652,27,nevada,12652,"English Americans form pluralities in Lincoln County, Churchill County, Lyon County, White Pine County, and Eureka County."
12653,27,nevada,12653, Asian Americans had been living in the state since the California Gold Rush of the 1850s brought thousands of Chinese miners to Washoe County.
12654,27,nevada,12654, They were followed by a few hundred Japanese agricultural workers at the end of the 19th century.
12655,27,nevada,12655,"In the late 20th century, many immigrants from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India and Vietnam arrived in the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12656,27,nevada,12656,"The city now has one of the most prolific American Asian communities in America, with a predominantly Chinese and Taiwanese region known as ""Chinatown"" west of I-15 on Spring Mountain Road."
12657,27,nevada,12657,"The American Filipinos are the largest Asian group in the state, with a population of more than 113,000."
12658,27,nevada,12658, They account for 56.5 per cent of the Asian population of Nevada and about 4.3 per cent of the population of the State as a whole.
12659,27,nevada,12659, Mining booms attract many Greek and Eastern European immigrants to Nevada.
12660,27,nevada,12660,"The Native American tribes of Nevada are the Koso, Paiute, Panamint, Shoshoni, Walapi, Washoe and Ute tribes."
12661,27,nevada,12661,"Mexico (39.5 per cent of immigrants), the Philippines (14.3 per cent), El Salvador (5.2 per cent), China (3.1 per cent) and Cuba (3 per cent) were the main countries of origin for immigrants to Nevada."
12662,27,nevada,12662,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, as Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."
12663,27,nevada,12663,A small percentage of the population of Nevada lives in rural areas.
12664,27,nevada,12664,The culture of these places differs significantly from the large metropolitan areas.
12665,27,nevada,12665,"The inhabitants of these rural counties tend to be inhabitants of Nevada, unlike the areas of Las Vegas and Reno, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state."
12666,27,nevada,12666,The rural population is also less diverse in terms of race and ethnicity.
12667,27,nevada,12667," Mining plays an important role in the economy of rural counties, as tourism is less important."
12668,27,nevada,12668,Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada.
12669,27,nevada,12669,Church attendance in Nevada is among the weakest in all American states.
12670,27,nevada,12670,"In a 2009 Gallup poll, only 30% of Nevadas reported that they attended the church every week or almost, compared to 42% of all Americans (it was found that only four states had a lower attendance rate than Nevada)."
12671,27,nevada,12671,"The main religious affiliations of the Nevada population are: Protestants 35%, no religion 28%, Roman Catholics 25%, Saint of the last days 4%, Jews 2%, Hindus less than 1%, Buddhists 0.5% and Islam less than 0.1%."
12672,27,nevada,12672, Some parts of Nevada (in the eastern parts of the State) are located in the Mormon Corridor.

12674,27,nevada,12674,The Jewish community is represented by The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute and Chabad.
12675,27,nevada,12675," Nevada's economy is linked to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling), mining and livestock farming."
12676,27,nevada,12676," Nevada's industrial products include tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing and electrical equipment."
12677,27,nevada,12677,The Bureau d'analyse économique estimates that Nevada's total public product in 2018 was $170 billion.
12678,27,nevada,12678,"The per capita personal income of the government in 2018 was $43,820, ranking 35th in the country."
12679,27,nevada,12679," Nevada's 2012 debt was $7.5 billion, or $3,100 per taxpayer."
12680,27,nevada,12680,"In December 2014, the state unemployment rate was 6.8%."
12681,27,nevada,12681, Nevada's economy is long linked to vice-industries.
12682,27,nevada,12682,"""Nevada was founded on mining and re-founded on sin – starting with the fight against prices and easy divorce a century ago, then extending to gambling and prostitution,"" said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist."
12683,27,nevada,12683,"In some parts of the state outside the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas, mining plays a major economic role."
12684,27,nevada,12684,"In value terms, gold is by far the most important mineral mined."
12685,27,nevada,12685,"In 2004, 6,800,000 ounces (1900,000,000 g) of gold worth $2.84 billion were exploited in Nevada and the state accounted for 8.7% of world gold production (see Gold Mining in Nevada)."
12686,27,nevada,12686,"Silver is a distant second, with 10,300,000 ounces (290,000 g) worth $69 million extracted in 2004 (see Silver mining in Nevada)."
12687,27,nevada,12687," Other Nevada-derived minerals include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite, and lithium."
12688,27,nevada,12688," Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high and production is highly sensitive to world commodity prices."
12689,27,nevada,12689,Cattle farming is a major economic activity in rural Nevada.
12690,27,nevada,12690," Nevada's agricultural products are cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions and potatoes."
12691,27,nevada,12691,"As of 1 January 2006, there were an estimated 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada."
12692,27,nevada,12692," Most of these animals feed in summer on routes, with additional food in winter."
12693,27,nevada,12693,Calfs are usually shipped to out-of-state feedlots in the fall for market fattening.
12694,27,nevada,12694,"More than 90% of the 484,000 acres (196,000 ha) of Nevada's cultivated land are used to grow hay, mainly alfalfa, for livestock feed."
12695,27,nevada,12695,"The main employers of the State in the first quarter of 2011 are the following, according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation:"
12696,27,nevada,12696,"Amtrak's California Zephyr train uses the original Union Pacific Transcontinental Railway line in daily service from Chicago to Emeryville, California, serving Elko, Winnemucca and Reno."
12697,27,nevada,12697, Las Vegas has not had a passenger train service since the cessation of the Amtrak Desert Wind in 1997.
12698,27,nevada,12698,"Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provides a connecting service from Las Vegas for trains to Needles, California, Los Angeles and Bakersfield, California; and from Stateline, Nevada, to Sacramento, California."
12699,27,nevada,12699, There have been a number of proposals to reintroduce service in Los Angeles or southern California.
12700,27,nevada,12700,The Union Pacific Railroad has a few railways north and south of Nevada.
12701,27,nevada,12701,Greyhound Lines offers a state bus service.
12702,27,nevada,12702,"Interstate 15 (I-15) passes through the southern end of the state, serving Las Vegas and other communities."
12703,27,nevada,12703,I-215 and I-515 also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12704,27,nevada,12704,"The I-80 crosses the northern portion of Nevada, following approximately the Humboldt River route from Utah to the east and the Truckee River to the west through Reno, California."
12705,27,nevada,12705,"He's got a spur path, I-580."
12706,27,nevada,12706," Nevada is also served by several U.S. highways: U.S. 6, U.S. 50, U.S. 93, U.S. 95 and U.S. 395."
12707,27,nevada,12707, There are also 189 itineraries of the State of Nevada.
12708,27,nevada,12708," Many counties in Nevada also have a network of county routes, although many are not signed or paved in rural areas."
12709,27,nevada,12709, Nevada is one of the few states in the United States that do not have a continuous interstate highway linking its two major population centres – the road link between the Las Vegas and Reno regions is a combination of several different interstate and American highways.
12710,27,nevada,12710,The routing proposed by Interstate 11 could potentially remedy this.
12711,27,nevada,12711,"The state is one of the few in the country to allow semi-trailers with three trailers – what could be called a ""road train"" in Australia."
12712,27,nevada,12712,"But the American versions are usually smaller, partly because they have to climb and descend a few steep mountain passes."
12713,27,nevada,12713,RTC Transit is the transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12714,27,nevada,12714,"The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a bus network across the Las Vegas Valley, including the use of The Deuce, a two-storey bus, on the Las Vegas Band and several peripheral routes."
12715,27,nevada,12715,RTC RIDE operates a local bus network throughout the metropolitan area of Reno-Sparks.
12716,27,nevada,12716, Other transit systems in the state include the Carson City JAC.
12717,27,nevada,12717, Most other counties in the state do not have public transport at all.
12718,27,nevada,12718,"In addition, a 4 mile (6.4 km) monorail provides public transportation in the Las Vegas area."
12719,27,nevada,12719," Las Vegas Monorail serves several casinos and Las Vegas Convention Centre, east of Las Vegas Strip, near Paradise Road, with a possible extension to McCarran International Airport."
12720,27,nevada,12720," Several hotels also manage their own monorail lines, which are usually several blocks in length."
12721,27,nevada,12721,The McCarran Las Vegas International Airport is the busiest airport in Nevada.
12722,27,nevada,12722,Reno-Tahoe International Airport (formerly Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the state.
12723,27,nevada,12723, Nevada has had a thriving solar energy sector.
12724,27,nevada,12724,An independent study conducted in 2013 concluded that solar energy users have created a net benefit of $36 million.
12725,27,nevada,12725," However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission allowed the State's only electricity company, NV Energy, to charge higher rates and charges to solar panel users, resulting in an immediate collapse of the use of solar panels on the roof."
12726,27,nevada,12726,"In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository as the only site to be considered a permanent repository for all highly radioactive wastes in the country."
12727,27,nevada,12727," Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Government of Nevada are divided into three separate departments: the Executive, composed of the Governor of Nevada and their Cabinet, as well as other elected members of the Constitution; the Legislative, composed of the Legislative Assembly of Nevada and the Senate; and the Judicial, composed of the Supreme Court of Nevada and the lower courts."
12728,27,nevada,12728,"The governor is the chief magistrate of Nevada, the head of the executive department of the state government, and the commander-in-chief of the state military forces."
12729,27,nevada,12729,"The current governor is Steve Sisolak, a Democrat."
12730,27,nevada,12730,The Nevada Legislature is a bicameral body divided into an assembly and a senator.
12731,27,nevada,12731,"The members of the Assembly sit for two years, and the members of the Senate for four years."
12732,27,nevada,12732,"The two chambers of the Nevada Legislative Assembly will be affected by the time limits from 2010, since senators and deputies/women will be limited to a maximum of 12 years in each chamber (by appointment or election that is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the Constitution that was recently confirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court in a unanimous decision."
12733,27,nevada,12733," Each session of Parliament meets for a constitutional term of 120 days for each odd year, or more if the Governor requests an extraordinary session."
12734,27,nevada,12734,"On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a female majority in its legislature."
12735,27,nevada,12735,Women occupy nine of the 21 seats in the Nevada Senate and 23 of the 42 seats in the Nevada Assembly.
12736,27,nevada,12736,The Supreme Court of Nevada is the Supreme Court of State and the head of the judicial branch of Nevada.
12737,27,nevada,12737," Initial jurisdiction is divided between District Courts (with general jurisdiction), Courts and Municipal Courts (both with limited jurisdiction)."
12738,27,nevada,12738," Appeals from district courts are addressed directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which, as part of a model of derogatory jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the Court of Appeal for final resolution."
12739,27,nevada,12739,"The cities of Nevada, known as cities, have the power to legislate on anything that is not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to allow local authorities to integrate the cities of Nevada to give them more flexibility and less restrictions on the part of the Legislative Assembly.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"The municipal councils of unincorporated cities are limited local administrations created either by the local county commission or by referendum, and constitute a purely consultative role and do not in any way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"By 1900 the population of Nevada was the smallest of all states and was decreasing, as the difficulties of living in a ""barren desert"" began to prevail over the lure of money for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743, Historian Lawrence Friedman explained what happened next:
12744,27,nevada,12744," With the arrival of air conditioning for the summer and the mild winters of southern Nevada, the state's fortunes began to revolve around, as for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growth in the Union."
12745,27,nevada,12745, Nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal – in an approved brothel in a county that specifically voted to allow it.
12746,27,nevada,12746,"It is illegal in large jurisdictions such as Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), Washoe County (which contains Reno) and the independent city of Carson City."

13610,29,new_jersey,13610,"Second, the 1923 Municipal Director Act, which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the council, and introduced a government structure to manage municipal affairs with a manager appointed for day-to-day administration."
13611,29,new_jersey,13611,"The Faulkner Act, passed in 1950 and largely amended in 1981, provides for four basic plans: the mayor-counsel, the council-manager, the small municipality and the mayor-counsel-administrative."
13612,29,new_jersey,13612,"The Act offers many choices to communities that prefer strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and provides great flexibility to allow municipalities to choose the characteristics of their government: the number of seats on the council; the seats selected in general, by neighbourhoods or by a combination of the two; staggered or concurrent mandates; and a mayor chosen by the council or directly elected by the voters."

13615,29,new_jersey,13615," Although municipalities retain their name derived from the types of government, they may have changed for one of the modern forms of government, or even more so in the past for one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities whose formal names are completely flouting for the general public."
13616,29,new_jersey,13616,"For example, although there are four municipalities that are officially village-type, Loch Arbour is the only one remaining with the form of village government."

13628,29,new_jersey,13628," Although the Democratic Party was very successful throughout the state, the state had Republican governors; from 1994 to 2002, Christine Todd Whitman won twice with 47% and 49% of the votes, respectively, and in the 2009 elections, Republican Chris Christie defeated outgoing Democrat Jon Corzine with 48% of the votes."

13632,29,new_jersey,13632,"In federal elections, the state relies heavily on the Democratic Party."
13633,29,new_jersey,13633,"For many years, however, it was a Republican bastion, having given comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the tight elections of 1948, 1968 and 1976."

13642,29,new_jersey,13642," About one-third of the state's counties are considered ""swing"" counties, but some go further than others."

14113,31,new_york,14113," From about 1640 to 1680, the Iroquoian peoples conducted campaigns ranging from modern Michigan to Virginia against the Algonquian and Siwan tribes, as well as both."
14114,31,new_york,14114,"The goal was to control more land for the trapping of animals, a career that most natives had turned to in the hope of trading first with whites."
14115,31,new_york,14115," This completely altered the ethnography of the region, and most of the big game was hunted before the whites fully exploded the land."
14116,31,new_york,14116," Subsequently, the Iroquoise Confederation provided shelter for refugees from the Muscouten, Erie, Chononton, Tutelo, Saponi and Tuscarora nations."
14117,31,new_york,14117,"In the 1700s, they also merged with the Mohawks during the Franco-Indian war and took the remaining Susquehannock from Pennsylvania after being decimated in the war."
14118,31,new_york,14118, Most of these other groups were involved until they ceased to exist.
14119,31,new_york,14119," Then, after the Revolution, a large group of them separated and returned to Ohio, becoming known as Mingo Senatorca."
14120,31,new_york,14120,"The six current tribes of the Iroquoise Confederation are the Senatorca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Tuscarora and Mohawk."

14123,31,new_york,14123," Meanwhile, the Lenapes formed a close relationship with William Penn."
14124,31,new_york,14124," However, when Penn died, his sons managed to take up much of their land and banish it in Ohio."
14125,31,new_york,14125," When the United States drafted the Indian Abduction Act, the Lenapes were moved to Missouri, while their cousins, the Mohicans, were sent to Wisconsin."
14126,31,new_york,14126,"In addition, in 1778, the United States moved the Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario, although they did not stay long."
14127,31,new_york,14127," They mainly chose to migrate to Canada and merge with the Iroquois, although some moved westward and merged with the Lenape."
14128,31,new_york,14128,"In 1524 Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer serving the French crown, explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland, including New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay."

14130,31,new_york,14130,"Verrazzano described it as ""a vast coastline with a deep delta in which any type of ship could pass"" and added: ""that it extends inside for a league and opens to form a beautiful lake."

14134,31,new_york,14134,"In 1540, French traders from New France built a castle on Castle Island in the present Albany; it was abandoned the following year due to flooding."
14135,31,new_york,14135,"In 1614 the Dutch, under Hendrick Corstiaensen's command, rebuilt the French castle, which they called Fort Nassau."
14136,31,new_york,14136,"Fort Nassau is the first Dutch settlement in North America and is located along the Hudson River, also in the present Albany."

14138,31,new_york,14138," Located on the floodplain of the Hudson River, the rudimentary ""strong"" was swept away by the floods in 1617, and abandoned for good after the construction of Fort Orange, Newfoundland, nearby in 1623."

14141,31,new_york,14141, His findings encouraged Dutch merchants to explore the coast in search of a profitable fur trade with local American Aboriginal tribes.
14142,31,new_york,14142," During the 17th century, Dutch trading posts were created for the trade of skins from the Lenape, Iroquois and other tribes in the colony of New Netherlands."
14143,31,new_york,14143,"The first of these trading posts was Fort Nassau (1614, near the present Albany); Fort Orange (1624, on the Hudson River, just south of the present city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau), developing in the Beverwijck settlement (1647), and in what became Albany; Fort Amsterdam (1625, to develop in the city of New Amsterdam which is now New York City); and Esopus (1653, now Kingston)."
14144,31,new_york,14144,"The success of the ironship of Rensselaerswyck (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the colony's initial success."

14149,31,new_york,14149,"The Congress of the Stamp met in the city on 19 October of the same year, composed of representatives of all the Thirteen Colonies that paved the way for the Continental Congress."
14150,31,new_york,14150,"The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the Bill of Rights and Grievances, which was the first written expression by American representatives of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence."
14151,31,new_york,14151, This included the right to representative government.
14152,31,new_york,14152,"At the same time, given the strong commercial, personal and sentimental ties with Britain, many New Yorkers were loyalists."
14153,31,new_york,14153,The capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the gun and powder needed to force a British withdrawal from the siege of Boston in 1775.
14154,31,new_york,14154,"New York was the only colony not to vote for independence, as delegates were not allowed to do so."

14156,31,new_york,14156,"The Constitution of the State of New York was governed by a convention that met in White Plains on July 10, 1776, and after repeated adjournments and change of location, concluded its work in Kingston on Sunday evening, April 20, 1777, when the new constitution drafted by John Jay was adopted with a single dissenting voice."

14161,31,new_york,14161," After their victory, the British occupied the city of New York, making it their military and political base of operations in North America during the duration of the conflict, and therefore the centre of interest of General George Washington's intelligence network."
14162,31,new_york,14162,"On the famous ships of the British Wallabout Bay prison, more American fighters died of deliberate negligence than were killed in combat in every battle of the combined war."

14164,31,new_york,14164,"The first of the two major British armies was captured by the Continental Army at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, a success that influenced France to join the revolutionaries.The constitution of the state was promulgated in 1777."

14167,31,new_york,14167,"In retaliation for the attacks on the border by the Mohawk forces of Joseph Brant and Loyalist, the Sullivan expedition in 1779 destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages, adjacent agricultural lands and winter shops, forcing many refugees to travel to Niagara under British control."
14168,31,new_york,14168,"As British allies, the Iroquois were expelled from New York, even though they had not participated in treaty negotiations."

14170,31,new_york,14170,"In the treaty, the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States."
14171,31,new_york,14171," Because New York entered into a treaty with the Iroquois without Congress' approval, some of the land purchases have been the subject of land claims by the federal government's recognized tribes since the end of the 20th century."
14172,31,new_york,14172,"New York has sold more than 5 million acres (20,000 km2) of former Iroquois territory in the years following the revolutionary war, leading to rapid development in northern New York."

14175,31,new_york,14175," This organization was found to be inadequate, and prominent New Yorker Alexander Hamilton advocated a new government that would include executive power, national courts and the power to impose."
14176,31,new_york,14176,"Hamilton led the Annapolis Convention (1786), which called for the Philadelphia Convention, which drafted the United States Constitution, in which he also participated."
14177,31,new_york,14177,The new government had to be a strong federal national government to replace the relatively weaker confederation of each state.
14178,31,new_york,14178," Following a lively debate, which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation — The Federalist Papers — as a series of articles in New York's newspapers, New York was the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution on July 26, 1788."
14179,31,new_york,14179,"New York remained the national capital under the new constitution until 1790, and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington, the drafting of the U.S. Bill of Rights and the first session of the U.S. Supreme Court."
14180,31,new_york,14180,Hamilton's recovery of the heavily indebted U.S. economy after the war and the establishment of a national bank have greatly contributed to making New York the financial centre of the new nation.

14188,31,new_york,14188," Agricultural products came from the Midwest, and finished manufactured products moved westward."
14189,31,new_york,14189,It was a wonder of genius that opened large areas of New York to commerce and colonization.
14190,31,new_york,14190,It has enabled the port cities of the Great Lakes such as Buffalo and Rochester to grow and prosper.
14191,31,new_york,14191,It has also linked the emerging agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes to the port of New York.

14211,31,new_york,14211," When the federal government took control, it created the Immigration Bureau, which chose the three-acre Ellis Island in Upper New York Harbour for an entry depot."
14212,31,new_york,14212," Already under federal control, the island was an ammunition depot."
14213,31,new_york,14213,"It was chosen because of its relative isolation with the proximity to New York City and the railway lines of Jersey City, New Jersey, by a short ferry ride."

15130,33,north_dakota,15130,The NPL presented candidates on the Republican ticket (but merged with the Democratic Party after the Second World War).

15135,33,north_dakota,15135,"In addition, the North Dakota Bank, with powers similar to those of a federal reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of sub-prime mortgages and their guarantee in the form of derivative instruments, thereby preventing the collapse of housing prices in the state following the 2008 financial crisis."

15141,33,north_dakota,15141,"In recent years, the State has registered unemployment rates below the national average and has increased employment and population growth."
15142,33,north_dakota,15142, Much of the growth was based on the development of Bakken's oil fields in the western part of the state.
15143,33,north_dakota,15143," Estimates of the remaining amount of oil in the region vary, some of which are estimated to be over 100 years old."

15146,33,north_dakota,15146,"In 2016, the violent crime rate was three times higher than in 2004, and the increase occurred mainly in the late 2000s, coinciding with the oil boom era."

15150,33,north_dakota,15150, This makes North Dakota the state of the United States with the highest percentage of population growth since 2011.
15151,33,north_dakota,15151,"North Dakota is the fourth least populated state in the country; only Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming have fewer residents."
15152,33,north_dakota,15152," With less than 2,000 people in 1870, the North Dakota population increased to nearly 680,000 in 1930."
15153,33,north_dakota,15153," Growth has then slowed and the population has fluctuated slightly over the last seven decades, reaching 617,761 at the 1970 census, compared to 642,200 at the 2000 census."
15154,33,north_dakota,15154," With the exception of Amerindians, the North Dakota population has a lower percentage of minorities than in the country as a whole."

15158,33,north_dakota,15158," Throughout the second half of the 19th century and until the beginning of the 20th century, North Dakota, with most of the Midwest, experienced a massive influx of newcomers from the eastern United States and immigrants from Europe."
15159,33,north_dakota,15159,"North Dakota is a popular destination known for immigrant farmers and workers in general and their families, mainly Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom."
15160,33,north_dakota,15160," Much of this colony was on the west side of the Red River Valley, as seen in South Dakota and parallel in Minnesota."
15161,33,north_dakota,15161, This area is known for its fertile land.
15162,33,north_dakota,15162,"At the dawn of the First World War, it was one of the richest agricultural areas in North America."
15163,33,north_dakota,15163,"But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants did not succeed in arid conditions."
15164,33,north_dakota,15164, Many family plots were too small to be successful in their operation.
15165,33,north_dakota,15165," Between the 1930s and the end of the 20th century, the North Dakota population gradually declined, interrupted by a few brief increases."

15167,33,north_dakota,15167," With the advance of the process of mechanization of agricultural practices, and the environmental conditions requiring more important land for successful agriculture, subsistence farming has proved to be too risky for families."
15168,33,north_dakota,15168, Many people have moved to urban areas to find a job.
15169,33,north_dakota,15169," Since the end of the 20th century, one of the main causes of migration from North Dakota has been the lack of skilled jobs for university graduates."

16241,36,oregon,16241,"One theory is that the name comes from the French word Ouragan (""windstorm"" or ""hurricane""), which was applied to the West River from the Amerindian tales of powerful Chinook winds on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from the first-hand French experience with the Chinook winds of the Great Plains."
16242,36,oregon,16242,"At the time, the western river was thought to rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the Great Plains."
16243,36,oregon,16243,Joaquin Miller explains in Sunset magazine in 1904 how the name Oregon is derived:
16244,36,oregon,16244," Another narrative, approved as the most plausible explanation in the book Oregon Geographic Names, was advanced by George R. Stewart in a 1944 article in American Speech."
16245,36,oregon,16245," According to Stewart, the name comes from the error of a engraver in a French map published at the beginning of the 18th century, on which the Ouisiconink River (Wisconsin) was spelled ""Ouaricon-sint"", broken on two lines with the -sint below, so there seems to be a river flowing westward called ""Ouaricon""."
16246,36,oregon,16246," According to the Oregon Tourism Commission, today's Oregonans pronounce the name of the state as ""or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or."
16247,36,oregon,16247," After being written by the Detroit Lions in 2002, the former Oregon Duck quarterback Joey Harrington distributed ""Orygun"" stickers to media members reminding them of how to pronounce the name of his home state."
16248,36,oregon,16248,The stickers are sold by the Bookshop of the University of Oregon.
16249,36,oregon,16249," Oregon is 295 miles (475 km) from north to south, at the longest distance, and 395 miles (636 km) from east to west."
16250,36,oregon,16250," With an area of 98,381 square miles (254,810 km2), Oregon is slightly larger than the United Kingdom."
16251,36,oregon,16251,It is the ninth largest state in the United States.
16252,36,oregon,16252,"The highest point in Oregon is the summit of Mount Hood, 11,249 feet (3,429 m), and its lowest point is the sea level of the Pacific Ocean along the Oregon coast."
16253,36,oregon,16253,"The average altitude of Oregon is 3300 feet (1,006 m)."
16254,36,oregon,16254," Crater Lake National Park, the only state national park, is the location of the deepest lake in the United States at 1,943 feet (592 m)."

16257,36,oregon,16257, Oregon is divided into eight geographical regions.
16258,36,oregon,16258,"In western Oregon: the Oregon coast (west of the coastal chain), the Willamette Valley, the Rogue Valley, the Cascade Range and the Klamath Mountains; and in central and eastern Oregon: the Columbia Plateau, the Upper Desert and the Blue Mountains."
16259,36,oregon,16259, Oregon is in two time zones.
16260,36,oregon,16260," Most of the county of Malheur is in the time zone of the mountains, while the rest of the state is in the time zone of the Pacific."
16261,36,oregon,16261,"The mountainous areas of western Oregon, home to three of the largest peaks in the United States, including Mount Hood, were formed by the volcanic activity of the Juan de Fuca Plate, a tectonic plaque that constitutes a continuous threat of volcanic activity and earthquakes in the region."
16262,36,oregon,16262,The most recent major activity was the earthquake of 1700 Cascadia.
16263,36,oregon,16263,"Mount St. Helens of Washington broke out in 1980, an event visible from northern Oregon affecting parts of the country."
16264,36,oregon,16264,"The Columbia River, which forms a large part of the northern border of Oregon, has also played a major role in the geological evolution of the region, as well as in its economic and cultural development."
16265,36,oregon,16265,The Columbia River is one of the largest rivers in North America and one of the two rivers to cross the Cascades (the Klamath River in southern Oregon is the other).
16266,36,oregon,16266," About 15,000 years ago, the Columbia River flooded much of Oregon several times during the Missoula floods; the modern fertility of the Willamette Valley is largely the result."
16267,36,oregon,16267,"For thousands of years, many salmon have made parts of the river, such as Celilo Falls, poles of economic activity."
16268,36,oregon,16268," Today, Oregon's landscape varies from rainforest in the coastal chain to the barren desert in the southeast, which still meets the technical definition of a border."
16269,36,oregon,16269,The geographic centre of Oregon is more to the west than the other 48 contiguous states (although the westernmost point of the 48 lower states is in Washington).
16270,36,oregon,16270,The geographical characteristics of the centre of Oregon range from high volcanic and desert rock formations resulting from lava beds.
16271,36,oregon,16271, Oregon Badlands Wilderness is in this area of the state.
16272,36,oregon,16272," Typical of a western state, Oregon is home to a unique and diverse set of wildlife."
16273,36,oregon,16273," About 60 per cent of the state is forest-covered, while the areas west of the Cascades are more forest-populated, representing about 80 per cent of the landscape."
16274,36,oregon,16274, About 60 per cent of Oregon's forests are on federal lands.
16275,36,oregon,16275, Oregon is the largest wood producer in the 48 lower states.

16278,36,oregon,16278," Although their existence in Oregon is not confirmed, cases of grizzly bears still appear, and it is likely that some still move to eastern Oregon from Idaho."
16279,36,oregon,16279," Oregon is home to what is considered the largest organism in the world, a fungus of Armillaria solidipes under the national forest of Malheur, in eastern Oregon."
16280,36,oregon,16280," Oregon has several national parks, including Crater Lake National Park in the southern Cascades, John Day Fossil Beds National Monument east of the Cascades, Lewis and Clark National Historic Park on the north coast, and Oregon Caves National Monument near the south coast."
16281,36,oregon,16281," Most of Oregon has a generally mild climate, although there are significant variations given the variety of landscapes across the state."
16282,36,oregon,16282,"The western region of the state (west of the Cascade Range) has an oceanic climate, populated by dense mixed, evergreen forests."
16283,36,oregon,16283,"The western Oregon climate is strongly influenced by the Pacific Ocean; the western third of Oregon is very humid in winter, moderately to very humid in spring and fall, and dry in summer."
16284,36,oregon,16284,"The relative humidity of western Oregon is high, except during summer days, which are semi-dry to semi-wet; eastern Oregon generally has low humidity throughout the year."
16285,36,oregon,16285,"The southwestern part of the state, particularly the Rogue Valley, has a Mediterranean climate with drier and sunny winters and warmer summers, similar to those of Northern California."
16286,36,oregon,16286,"The northeastern part of Oregon has a steppe climate, and its high-altitude regions have a subarctic climate."
16287,36,oregon,16287," Like Western Europe, Oregon and the Pacific Northwest in general are considered warm for their latitude, and the condition has much milder winters at a given altitude than comparable latitudes elsewhere in North America, such as Upper Midwest, Ontario, Quebec and New England."
16288,36,oregon,16288," However, the state ranks fifth for the coolest summer temperatures in any state of the country, after Maine, Idaho, Wyoming and Alaska."
16289,36,oregon,16289,"The two-thirds east of Oregon, which largely include a high desert, have cold, snowy winters and very dry summers."
16290,36,oregon,16290," Much of the east is semi-arid to arid like the rest of the Great Basin, although the Blue Mountains are humid enough to support large forests."
16291,36,oregon,16291," While most of Oregon receives significant snowfalls, the Willamette Valley, home to 60 per cent of the population, has much milder winters for its latitude and generally sees only slight snowfalls."
16292,36,oregon,16292,"The highest temperature recorded in Oregon was 119°F (48°C) at Pendleton on August 10, 1898, and the lowest recorded temperature was −54°F (−48°C) at Senatorca on February 10, 1933."

16295,36,oregon,16295," During the 18th and 19th centuries, the European powers, and later the United States, seized possession of the region until 1846, when the United States and Great Britain completed the division of the region."
16296,36,oregon,16296, Oregon became a state on 14 February 1859 and by 2015 has more than four million inhabitants.
16297,36,oregon,16297," Although there is considerable evidence that the Paleo-Indians lived in the area, the oldest evidence of habitation in Oregon was found in Fort Rock Cave and the Paisley Caves in Lake County."
16298,36,oregon,16298,"Archaeologist Luther Cressman dated Fort Rock's equipment at 13,200 years ago, and there is evidence that supports the area's inhabitants at least 15,000 years ago."
16299,36,oregon,16299,"In 8000 B.C., there were colonies throughout the state, with populations concentrated along the lower Columbia River, in the western valleys and around coastal estuaries."
16300,36,oregon,16300," During the prehistoric period, the Willamette Valley area was flooded after the collapse of the ice dams of the Missoula Lake era, located in what would later become Montana."
16301,36,oregon,16301, These massive floods occurred during the last glacial period and filled the valley with 300 to 400 feet of water (91 to 122 m).
16302,36,oregon,16302,"In the 16th century, Oregon was home to many Amerindian groups, including Chinook, Shell (Ko-Kwell), Bannock, Chasta, Kalapuya, Klamath, Klickitat, Molalla, Nez Perce, Takelma, Killamuk, Neah-kah-nie, Umatilla and Umpqua."

18093,41,tennessee,18093,"The first variant of the name that became Tennessee was recorded by Captain Juan Pardo, the Spanish explorer, when he and his men crossed an American Indian village named ""Tanasqui"" in 1567 while traveling inland of South Carolina."
18094,41,tennessee,18094,"At the beginning of the 18th century, British traders met a city of Cherokee called Tanasi (or ""Tanase"", in the syllable : """") in the present Monroe County, Tennessee."
18095,41,tennessee,18095,"The town was located on a river of the same name (now known as Little Tennessee River), and appears on the maps as early as 1725."
18096,41,tennessee,18096,"It is not known whether it was the same city as Juan Pardo's, although recent research suggests that Pardo's ""Tanasqui"" was located at the confluence of the Pigeon River and the Broad River near modern Newport."
18097,41,tennessee,18097,The meaning and origin of this word are uncertain.
18098,41,tennessee,18098, Some accounts suggest that this is a Cherokee modification of a Yuchi word earlier.
18099,41,tennessee,18099,"It is said to be a meeting place, a winding river or a large bend river."
18100,41,tennessee,18100," According to ethnograph James Mooney, the name ""can't be analyzed"" and its meaning is lost."
18101,41,tennessee,18101,"The modern spelling, Tennessee, is attributed to James Glen, the governor of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s."
18102,41,tennessee,18102,"The spelling was popularized by the publication of Henry Timberlake ""Draught of the Cherokee Country"" in 1765."
18103,41,tennessee,18103,"In 1788, North Carolina created Tennessee County, the third county to be established in what is now the Middle Tennessee."
18104,41,tennessee,18104,(Tennessee County was the predecessor of the current counties of Montgomery and Robertson.)
18105,41,tennessee,18105," When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state outside the south-west territory, it adopted the name of the ""Tennessee"" state."
18106,41,tennessee,18106,"Tennessee is known as The Volunteer State, a nickname that some claimed to have been won during the War of 1812 because of the important role played by Tennessee volunteer soldiers, particularly during the Battle of New Orleans."
18107,41,tennessee,18107," Other sources differ as to the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to volunteers for the war between Mexico and America from 1846 to 1848."
18108,41,tennessee,18108," This explanation is more likely, as President Polk's call for 2,600 national volunteers at the beginning of the Mexico-America war resulted in only 30,000 Tennessee volunteers, largely in response to Davy Crockett's death and the appeals of the former Tennessee governor and then Texas politician Sam Houston."
18109,41,tennessee,18109,"Tennessee borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north; North Carolina to the east; Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi to the south; Arkansas and Missouri to the west."

18127,41,tennessee,18127,"The Blue Ridge area is located on the eastern edge of Tennessee, which borders North Carolina."
18128,41,tennessee,18128," This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the western Blue Ridge Mountains, which are subdivided into several sub-ranges, namely the Smoky Mountains, the Baldes Mountains, the Unicoi Mountains, the Unaka and Roan Highlands Mountains, and the Iron Mountains."

18145,41,tennessee,18145,The Middle Tennessee was a common destination for settlers crossing the Appalachians from Virginia in the late 18th century and early 19th century.
18146,41,tennessee,18146,"An important trade route called the Natchez Trace, created and used for many generations by American Indians, connects the middle Tennessee to the city of the lower Mississippi of Natchez."
18147,41,tennessee,18147,The Natchez Trace route was used as the basis for a scenic highway called Natchez Trace Parkway.
18148,41,tennessee,18148, Some of the last large American chestnut trees grow in this area.

18156,41,tennessee,18156,"In Tennessee, the Gulf Coast Plain is divided into three sections extending from the Tennessee River east to the Mississippi River west."
18157,41,tennessee,18157,"The eastmost stretch, about 16 km wide, consists of hilly lands along the west bank of the Tennessee River."

18166,41,tennessee,18166," Fifty-four state parks, with an area of approximately 132,000 acres (530 km2), as well as parts of Grandes Monts Smoky National Park and Cherokee National Forest, and Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, are located in Tennessee."
18167,41,tennessee,18167,"Sportsmen and visitors are attracted to Lake Reelfoot, originally formed by the earthquakes of 1811–12 in Madrid; the stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, as well as the lotus bed covering the shallow waters, give the lake a strange beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168," Most of the condition has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher altitudes in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a humid temperate mountain or continental climate due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in the Tennessee climate, with southern winds accounting for most of the annual rainfall in the state."
18170,41,tennessee,18170,"In general, the condition has warm summers and mild to cold winters with generous precipitation throughout the year, with the highest average monthly precipitation generally in winter and spring, between December and April."
18171,41,tennessee,18171,"The driest months are, on average, from August to October."
18172,41,tennessee,18172,"On average, the condition receives 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation each year."
18173,41,tennessee,18173,Snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13 cm) in West Tennessee to more than 80 inches (200 cm) in the highest mountains of East Tennessee.
18174,41,tennessee,18174,"Summers in the state are generally warm and humid, with most of the condition averaging about 90°F (32°C) during the summer months."
18175,41,tennessee,18175,"Winters tend to be mild to cold, increasing in freshness at higher altitudes."
18176,41,tennessee,18176,"In general, for areas outside the highest mountains, the middle hollows of the night are close to freezing in most states."
18177,41,tennessee,18177,"The highest recorded temperature was 113°F (45°C) at Perryville on August 9, 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature was −32°F (−36°C) at Mountain City on December 30, 1917."
18178,41,tennessee,18178," Although the state is far enough away from the coast to avoid any direct impact of a hurricane, the state location makes it likely to be affected by the remnants of tropical cyclones that weaken on the earth and can cause significant precipitation, such as tropical storm Chris in 1982 and hurricane Opal in 1995."
18179,41,tennessee,18179,"The average state is about fifty days of storms per year, some of which can be severe with great hail and devastating winds."
18180,41,tennessee,18180,"The tornadoes are possible throughout the state, with the most vulnerable Western and Middle Tennessee."
18181,41,tennessee,18181," From time to time, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating tornadoes of April 2011 that killed twenty people in North Georgia and South-East Tennessee."
18182,41,tennessee,18182,"On average, the State has 15 tornadoes per year."
18183,41,tennessee,18183,"The tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the country in the percentage of total tornadoes that have died."
18184,41,tennessee,18184,"Winter storms are an occasional problem, such as the famous 1993 Blizzard, although ice storms are more likely."
18185,41,tennessee,18185,"Fog is a persistent problem in some parts of the state, particularly in Eastern Tennessee."
18186,41,tennessee,18186,"The capital and largest city is Nashville, although Knoxville, Kingston and Murfreesboro have served as state capitals in the past."
18187,41,tennessee,18187,The metropolitan area of 13 counties of Nashville has been the largest in the state since 1990.
18188,41,tennessee,18188,Memphis was the largest city in the state until 2018 when it was overtaken by Nashville.
18189,41,tennessee,18189,"Chattanooga and Knoxville, both east of the Smoky Mountains, are about a third of this size."
18190,41,tennessee,18190,"Clarksville is a fifth largest population centre, 72 km northwest of Nashville."
18191,41,tennessee,18191,"Murfreesboro is the sixth city in Tennessee, composed of 146,900 residents."
18192,41,tennessee,18192,"The area now known as Tennessee was first inhabited by the Paleo-Indians almost 12,000 years ago."
18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between the first colony and the time of European contact were unknown, but several distinct cultural phases were named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 B.C.), Woodland (1000 B.C. – 1000 B.C.) and Mississippi (1000–1600 B.C.), whose chiefs of staff were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who lived in the Tennessee River Valley before the migration of Cherokee into river waters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first European excursions recorded in today's so-called Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559 and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo has registered the name ""Tanasqui"" of a local Indian village, which has evolved towards the current state name."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,At that time Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi.
18197,41,tennessee,18197," Perhaps because of devastating European diseases the Indian tribes, which would have left a vacuum of population, and also because of the expansion of the European colony in the north, the Cherokee moved south of the area now known as Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European settlers spread throughout the region, Indian populations were forcibly displaced south and west, including all the Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, Chickasaw and Choctaw, and finally Cherokee in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British colony in today's Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near the present Vonore."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,On that date Fort Loudoun became the westmost British outpost.
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard of Brahm and built by forces under the command of British captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202," After his completion, Captain Raymond Demeré gave up command on 14 Aug. 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203," Hostilities broke out between the British and the neighbour Overhill Cherokees, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with his surrender on 7 Aug. 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The next morning Captain Paul Demeré and a number of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of Eastern and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began to arrive at the end of the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,"The majority of 18th-century settlers were English or predominantly English, but almost 20% were also Scottish-Irish."
18207,41,tennessee,18207," These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on land leased to the Cherokee."
18208,41,tennessee,18208," During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycomore Shoals (now Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his belligerent faction of Cherokee, who were aligned with the British loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209, These Cherokee renegats were designated by settlers as the Chickamauga.
18210,41,tennessee,18210, They oppose the annexation by North Carolina of the Washington District and the simultaneous colonization of Transylvania to the north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The lives of many settlers were spared from the first attacks of warriors by the warnings of Nancy Ward, the cousin of Dragging Canoe."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The boundary fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a gathering place in 1780 for Overmountain's men to hike over the Appalachian Mountains, engage and defeat the British army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213, Three counties in Washington District (now part of Tennessee) left North Carolina in 1784 and formed Franklin State.
18214,41,tennessee,18214," Efforts to gain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (now eight) had joined North Carolina in 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the region to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized in southwestern territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In an effort to encourage settlers to move westward into the new territory, in 1787 the mother state of North Carolina ordered to cut off a road to take settlers to the Cumberland colonies — from the south end of Mount Clinch (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Trace d'Avery"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Route de la Wilderness"" through the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,Tennessee was admitted to the Union on 1 June 1796 as the 16th State.
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It is the first state created from a territory under the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal government.
18220,41,tennessee,18220," Apart from the 13 former colonies, only Vermont and Kentucky preceded the creation of the state of Tennessee, and neither was a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, article I, section 31, stipulates that the starting point for the identification of the boundary is the extreme height of the stone mountain, at the point where the Virginia line intersects it, and leads essentially the extreme heights of the mountain ranges through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee after the Amerindian cities of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of said mountain (mount Unicoi) to the southern boundary of the State; all the territory, lands and waters to the west of said line are included within the limits and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also specified that the boundaries and jurisdiction of the State would include the future acquisition of land, reference to possible land exchanges with other States or the acquisition of territory west of the Mississippi River."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As other white settlers settled in Tennessee, they became increasingly in conflict with the Amerindian tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224," During the administration of US President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."
18225,41,tennessee,18225,"American troops forced them to walk from ""emigration depots"" in eastern Tennessee, like Fort Cass, to Indian territory further west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma."
18226,41,tennessee,18226," During this relocation, approximately 4,000 Cherokees died along the western road."
18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi, ""the track where we shouted""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Indians forced to emigrate as a result of the expulsion efforts of the Indians from the United States, so the expression ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indians, particularly among the ""Five Civilized Tribes."""
18229,41,tennessee,18229,The expression originated from a description of the previous emigration of the Choctaw Nation.
18230,41,tennessee,18230,"In February 1861 secessionists from the Tennessee government, led by Governor Isham Harris, asked for approval of an agreement to break ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a margin of 54-46%."
18231,41,tennessee,18231,"The strongest opposition to secession came from the Eastern Tennessee, which later attempted to form a separate state aligned with the Union."
18232,41,tennessee,18232," Following the confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's appeal for Tennessee and other states in response, Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization, submitted a secession order to the General Assembly, and made direct openings to the Confederate government."
18233,41,tennessee,18233,"On May 7, 1861, the legislature of Tennessee ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States."
18234,41,tennessee,18234,"On 8 June 1861, when the inhabitants of the middle Tennessee had changed their position considerably, the voters approved a second referendum calling for secession, thus becoming the last state to do so."
18235,41,tennessee,18235,"But Scott's state, supported by the Union, was also established at that time, and remained a de facto enclave of the United States throughout the war."
18236,41,tennessee,18236," Many major battles of the American civil war took place in Tennessee, most of the Union's victories."
18237,41,tennessee,18237,Ulysse S. Grant and the U.S. Navy took control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862.
18238,41,tennessee,18238, They detained the confederate counter-attack in Shiloh in April.
18239,41,tennessee,18239,"Memphis fell into the Union in June, after a naval battle on the Mississippi River in front of the city."
18240,41,tennessee,18240,The capture of Memphis and Nashville gave the Union control of the western and middle sections.
18241,41,tennessee,18241, This control was confirmed at the Battle of Murfreesboro in early January 1863 and by the subsequent Tullahoma campaign.

18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution prohibits martial law within its jurisdiction.
18472,41,tennessee,18472, This may be the result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by the U.S. government's (North) Union forces after the American civil war.
18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee politics, like that of most American states, are dominated by Republican and Democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474," Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state until the period of the American civil war; for decades after, a third east of the state was strongly republican and two thirds Western voted mostly democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475," This division was linked to the structure of the state in agriculture, plantations and servitude."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern part was made up of Yemeni farmers, but the middle and western Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton, which depended on slave labour."
18477,41,tennessee,18477, These regions were defined as democratic after the war.
18478,41,tennessee,18478," During the reconstruction, freed men and former free-coloured people were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party."
18479,41,tennessee,18479," Many African-Americans have been elected to local offices, some to state posts."
18480,41,tennessee,18480," After the reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have a competitive party policy, but in the 1880s, the White-majority state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a voting fee for voter registration."

18482,41,tennessee,18482,"In 1900, African-Americans accounted for 23.8 per cent of the state's population, concentrated in the Middle and Western Tennessee."
18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of city commission government on the basis of a broad vote for a few positions on a board of directors of the Commission; several cities adopted this as another means of limiting African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,"In 1913, the State Parliament enacted a bill allowing cities to adopt this structure without legislative approval."
18485,41,tennessee,18485," After the abandonment of the Blacks' right to vote, the Republican Party in Tennessee became a predominantly white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, with the exception of two republican landslides at the national level of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee strongly supported Warren G. Harding over the governor of Ohio James Cox, and in 1928, when he voted more resolutely for Herbert Hoover over the governor of New York Al Smith), the state was part of the solid democratic South until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In this post-war decade, he voted twice for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the armed forces during the Second World War."
18488,41,tennessee,18488," Since then, more state voters have turned to Republican support, and candidates for the democratic presidency have only carried Tennessee four times."
18489,41,tennessee,18489,"In 1960, African-Americans made up 16.45 per cent of the population of the state."
18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was not until after the mid-1960s and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new mechanisms, such as the governments of the major municipal commissions, were adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491,The old government.
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former U.S. Senator Bill Brock won in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among the Whites for state-wide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493," Since 1970, Tennessee has chosen governors from different parties."
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"At the beginning of the 21st century, Republican voters controlled most of the state, especially in rural and suburban areas outside the cities; the democratic force was mainly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and was particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter includes a large African-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496," Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in Eastern Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"The 1st and 2nd districts of Tennessee, based respectively in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, are among the few historical republican districts of the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498,The inhabitants of these districts supported the Union on Confederation during the civil war
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first one has been in Republican hands permanently since 1881, and the Republicans (or their predecessors) have held it for all but four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The second is held permanently by the Republicans or their predecessors since 1859.

18502,41,tennessee,18502," Senator of Tennessee, did not bear his original state, an unusual event, but revealing the strengthening of Republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503," Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, his margin of victory in the state rising from 4% in 2000 to 14% in 2004."
18504,41,tennessee,18504," Candidates for the democratic presidency of southern states, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, are generally better off than their North Tennessee counterparts, especially among voters split outside metropolitan areas."

18507,41,tennessee,18507,"In the 2008 elections, the Republican party took control of the two chambers of the Tennessee legislature for the first time since the reconstruction."
18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, about 30 per cent of the state electorate identified itself as independent."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"Baker v. Carr (1962) of the United States Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one voice"", requiring that state legislatures re-district the distribution of Congress on the basis of decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,He also demanded that the two chambers of state legislatures be population-based for representation rather than geographical districts such as counties.
18511,41,tennessee,18511, This case was the result of a lawsuit challenging the long-standing rural bias in the distribution of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512," After decades of under-representation of urban populations in many state legislatures, this important decision has led to increased (and proportional) importance in the policy of the State by cities and, ultimately, the suburbs, legislators and public office holders in relation to their population within the State."
18513,41,tennessee,18513,"The decision also applies to many other states that have long been controlled by rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont and Montana."
18514,41,tennessee,18514,"The State of Tennessee has four law enforcement agencies: the Tennessee Road Patrol, the Tennessee Wildlife Agency, the Tennessee Investigation Bureau and the Tennessee Environment and Conservation Department."

18519,41,tennessee,18519,Local law enforcement services are distributed between the county sheriff's offices and municipal police services.
18520,41,tennessee,18520,The Tennessee Constitution requires that each county have an elected Sheriff.
18521,41,tennessee,18521,"In 94 of the 95 counties, the Sheriff is the chief of law enforcement in the county and has jurisdiction over the entire county."
18522,41,tennessee,18522," Each sheriff's office is responsible for the service of warrants, court security, prison operations and primary law enforcement in unincorporated areas of a county, as well as support to municipal police services."
18523,41,tennessee,18523, Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police service in order to provide police services within the limits of their organization.

18528,41,tennessee,18528,The death penalty exists in Tennessee at various times since the establishment of the State.
18529,41,tennessee,18529," Before 1913, the method of execution was hung."
18530,41,tennessee,18530," From 1913 to 1915, executions were interrupted, but were restored in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531," From 1972 to 1978, the Supreme Court found capital punishment unconstitutional (Furman v. Georgia), and there were no other executions."
18532,41,tennessee,18532,"The death penalty resumed in 1978, although prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 were mostly sentenced to life imprisonment."
18533,41,tennessee,18533," From 1916 to 1960, the State executed 125 prisoners."

18538,41,tennessee,18538,"In May 2014, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a law authorizing the use of the electric chair for executions on death row when lethal injection drugs are not available."
18539,41,tennessee,18539,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band is the only Indian Indian tribe recognized by the federal government.
18540,41,tennessee,18540,"It owns 79 acres (32 ha) in Henning, which was placed in trust by the federal tribe in 2012."

18570,42,texas,18570,The annexation of the state triggered a chain of events that led to the Mexican-American war in 1846.
18571,42,texas,18571,"A slave state before the American civil war, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861, and officially joined the Confederate States of America on 2 March of the same year."
18572,42,texas,18572," After the civil war and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation."

18574,42,texas,18574," Before and after the American Civil War, the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic engine for the state, thus creating the traditional image of Texas cowboy."
18575,42,texas,18575,"In the 19th century, cotton and lumber became important industries as the livestock industry became less lucrative."
18576,42,texas,18576,But it was finally the discovery of large oil fields (Spindletop in particular) that triggered an economic boom that became the driving force of the economy for much of the 20th century.

18588,42,texas,18588,Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of pre-Columbian North America: the Southwest and the Plains.
18589,42,texas,18589,Archaeologists found that three large indigenous cultures lived on this territory and reached their development summit before the first European contact.
18590,42,texas,18590, These were:
18591,42,texas,18591," When Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Aboriginal people divided into several smaller tribes."
18592,42,texas,18592," These were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan and Uto-Aztecan."
18593,42,texas,18593,"The peoples of Puebloan Uto-Aztecan lived near Rio Grande in the western part of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived within the country, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region, and the Atakapans were mainly centered along the Gulf coast."
18594,42,texas,18594,"At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the Aranama, lived in southern Texas."
18595,42,texas,18595,"The entire cultural group, mainly centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct."
18596,42,texas,18596,It is difficult to say who originally lived in the northwestern part of the state.
18597,42,texas,18597,"At the time when the region came to be explored, it belonged to the well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztécan people that had turned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century."
18598,42,texas,18598,"It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans."
18599,42,texas,18599,"No culture was dominant in the present Texas region, and many peoples lived in it."
18600,42,texas,18600," Native American tribes living within the present borders of Texas include Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa and Wichita."
18601,42,texas,18601,"The name Texas derives from táysha, a word in the Caddoan language of Hasinai, which means ""friends"" or ""allies""."
18602,42,texas,18602,"The area was mainly controlled by the Spaniards during the first two centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution."
18603,42,texas,18603," They were not particularly kind to their indigenous populations, let alone to the Caddoans, who had no confidence because their culture was divided between the Spanish and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604," When the Spaniards briefly managed to conquer the colony of Louisiana, they decided to change tactics and try to be extremely friends with the Indians, which they continued even after the French had taken over the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605," After the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, the United States inherited this strange circumstance."
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred the American company and almost all their population migrated to the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spaniards felt swindled after spending so much time and effort and began trying to attract the Caddo back, promising them even more land."
18608,42,texas,18608," Apparently, without knowing how they arrived, the United States (which had begun to convince the tribes to separate from the Whites by selling everything and moving west since they purchased Louisiana) faced an overflow of indigenous peoples from Missouri and Arkansas and had been able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced populations to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609," They included Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, among others, who had all come to regard the Caddoans as saviors, making these peoples very influential."
18610,42,texas,18610,The question of whether an Amerindian tribe was friendly or warrior was crucial for the fate of European explorers and settlers in that land.
18611,42,texas,18611," Friendly tribes have taught newcomers to grow native crops, prepare food, and hunt wild game."
18612,42,texas,18612,Warrior tribes have made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to newcomers.
18613,42,texas,18613," During the Texas revolution, the United States was heavily involved."
18614,42,texas,18614,Previous treaties with Spain prohibit both parties from militarizing its indigenous population in any potential conflict between the two nations.
18615,42,texas,18615,"At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans began to spread."
18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans have always been meaningless when questioned, the Texan and American authorities in the region have never been able to find any solid evidence linking them to it and often it was so far from the Caddoan lands, it made little sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,"It seems very likely that these are false flag attacks aimed at triggering a cascade effect to force the indigenous people under Caddoan's influence to enter into armed conflict without violating any treaty, preferably on the Spanish side."
18618,42,texas,18618," Although no evidence was found as to who the culprit was, the Texas officials at the time tried several times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check."

18800,42,texas,18800,The Red River is a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north.
18801,42,texas,18801,The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east.
18802,42,texas,18802,"Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a northern border with Oklahoma at 36° 30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso is located on the western tip of the state at 32° N and Rio Grande."
18803,42,texas,18803," With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions, regional classification becomes problematic given differences in soil, topography, geology, precipitation, and plant and animal communities."
18804,42,texas,18804,"A classification system divides Texas, in order of southeast to west, with respect to the Gulf coastal plains, the inland lowlands, the Great Plains, and the province of the basin and range."
18805,42,texas,18805,"The Gulf coastal plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico, on the southeastern part of the state."
18806,42,texas,18806,"In this region, vegetation consists of thick pine wood."
18807,42,texas,18807,The Low Inland Region consists of gently sloping hilly forestland and is part of a larger pine forest.
18808,42,texas,18808,The Cross Timbers area and the Caprock Escarpment are part of the inland lowlands.
18809,42,texas,18809,The Great Plains region of central Texas crosses the panhandle of the state and Llano Estacado to the mountainous country of the state near Austin.
18810,42,texas,18810, This area is dominated by prairie and steppe.
18811,42,texas,18811,"The ""Far West Texas"" or ""Trans-Pecos"" region is the province of the Basin and the state range."
18812,42,texas,18812,"The most varied area includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded slopes and desert meadows."
18813,42,texas,18813,"Texas has 3,700 designated streams and 15 main rivers, with Rio Grande being the largest."

18819,42,texas,18819,"Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Western Sierra Madre of Mexico."
18820,42,texas,18820,The continental crust forms a stable mesoproterozoic craton that transforms through a wide continental margin and a transient crust into a true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico.
18821,42,texas,18821,"The oldest rocks in Texas date from Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old."
18822,42,texas,18822," These igneous and metamorphic precambrian rocks underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: the Llano Uprising, Van Horn and Franklin Mountains, near El Paso."
18823,42,texas,18823,Sedimentary rocks cover most of these ancient rocks.
18824,42,texas,18824,"The oldest sediments were deposited on the sides of a torn continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian."
18825,42,texas,18825, This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided into the Pennsylvania subperiod to form Pangea.
18826,42,texas,18826,It is the buried ridge of the Appalachian-Ouachita Mountains area of Pennsylvania's continental collision.
18827,42,texas,18827, This orogenic ridge is now buried under the Dallas–Waco–Austin–San Antonio trend.
18828,42,texas,18828,The end of the Paleozoic mountains collapsed as the Jurassic period began to open the Gulf of Mexico.
18829,42,texas,18829,"Pangea began to break in the Triassic, but the seabed extending to form the Gulf of Mexico only appeared in the Jurassic of the middle and the end."
18830,42,texas,18830,The coastline has moved back to the eastern margin of the state and the passive margin of the Gulf of Mexico has begun to form.
18831,42,texas,18831," Today, 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediment is buried under the Texas continental shelf and a large portion of the remaining U.S. oil reserves are here."
18832,42,texas,18832,"At the beginning of its formation, the nascent basin of the Gulf of Mexico was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of the Jurassic age."
18833,42,texas,18833, These salt deposits form salt domes and are located in eastern Texas along the Gulf Coast.
18834,42,texas,18834,Outcrops in eastern Texas consist of cretaceous and paleogenic sediments that contain large deposits of eocene lignite.
18835,42,texas,18835,"The Mississippi and Pennsylvania sediments to the north; the permian sediments to the west; and the Cretaceous sediments to the east, along the Gulf coast, and on the Texas continental shelf contain oil."
18836,42,texas,18836,"Volcanic rocks of the oligocene are found in the extreme west of Texas, in the Big Bend area."
18837,42,texas,18837,A sediment cover of the Miocene known as Ogallala Formation in the Western High Plains region is an important aquifer.
18838,42,texas,18838," Located far from an active plate tectonic limit, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes."
18839,42,texas,18839, Many animals and insects live in Texas.

18842,42,texas,18842,"Texas hosts several species of wasps, including an abundance of Polist Excamans, and is an important field for the study of Polists annularis."
18843,42,texas,18843,"In spring, wildflowers from Texas such as the flower of the state, the bluebonnet, highways of line throughout Texas."
18844,42,texas,18844," During the Johnson administration, the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, worked to draw attention to the wildflowers of Texas."
18845,42,texas,18845,The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of several climatic zones give the state a very variable time.
18846,42,texas,18846,"The state Panhandle has colder winters than northern Texas, while the Gulf coast has mild winters."
18847,42,texas,18847,Texas has large variations in precipitation patterns.
18848,42,texas,18848,"El Paso, at the western end of the state, has an average of 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual precipitation, while parts of southeastern Texas have an average of 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year."
18849,42,texas,18849,Dallas in the North Central Region has an average of 37 inches (940 mm) more moderate per year.
18850,42,texas,18850,"Snow falls several times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous region of western Texas, once or twice a year in northern Texas, and once every few years in central and eastern Texas."
18851,42,texas,18851,Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances.
18852,42,texas,18852,"Note the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm when 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average temperature was 65°F in December."
18853,42,texas,18853," Maximum summer temperatures are on average 80°F (26°C) in the mountains of western Texas and on Galveston Island at approximately 100°F (38°C) in the Rio Grande Valley, but most regions of Texas have consistently high summer temperatures in the 90°F (32°C) range."
18854,42,texas,18854, Morning temperatures range from 50 °F (14 °C) in the western Texas mountains to 80 °F (27 °C) in Galveston.

18857,42,texas,18857, Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas.
18858,42,texas,18858,"The state has the most tornadoes in the United States, with an average of 139 tornadoes per year."
18859,42,texas,18859, These strikes occur most often in northern Texas and the Panhandle.
18860,42,texas,18860,"The tornadoes in Texas usually occur during the months of April, May and June."
18861,42,texas,18861, Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have hit Texas.
18862,42,texas,18862,"A hurricane of 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane of 1886 that destroyed the city."
18863,42,texas,18863, These events enabled Galveston to take control of the Chief Port City.
18864,42,texas,18864," Hurricane Galveston of 1900 subsequently devastated this city, killing about 8,000 people and even up to 12,000 people."
18865,42,texas,18865, This makes it the most deadly natural disaster in the history of the United States.
18866,42,texas,18866,"In 2017, Hurricane Harvey fell in Rockport as a Category 4 hurricane and caused significant damage."
18867,42,texas,18867,"The storm lasted a long time, allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain on the Greater Houston area and the surrounding counties."
18868,42,texas,18868, This has resulted in widespread and catastrophic floods that have flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.
18869,42,texas,18869,"Harvey eventually became the most expensive hurricane in the world, causing damage estimated at $198.6 billion, exceeding the cost of Hurricane Katrina."
18870,42,texas,18870," Other devastating hurricanes in Texas include Hurricane Galveston of 1915, Hurricane Audrey in 1957, which killed more than 600 people, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008."

18872,42,texas,18872,"In 2017, Texas emits the most greenhouse gases in the U.S. nearly double California, the second most polluting state.In 2017, the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide each year."
18873,42,texas,18873,"As an independent nation, Texas will be the world's seventh largest greenhouse gas producer."
18874,42,texas,18874,The causes of the government's large greenhouse gas emissions include the large number of state coal-fired power plants and the government's refining and manufacturing industries.
18875,42,texas,18875,"In 2010, there were 2,553 ""emission events"" that released 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tonnes) of contaminants into the Texas sky."

18883,42,texas,18883,"The 160,000-square-kilometre (160,000 km2) area is home to most of the largest cities and metropolitan areas of the state, as well as 17 million people, accounting for almost 75 per cent of the total population of Texas."
18884,42,texas,18884, Houston and Dallas have been recognized as cities around the world.
18885,42,texas,18885, These cities are scattered throughout the state.
18886,42,texas,18886," Unlike cities, unincorporated rural settlements, known as colonias, often lack basic infrastructure and are marked by poverty."

19494,43,utah,19494,"Previous studies have shown a widespread decline in snow quantity above Utah, accompanied by a decrease in the snow-precipitation ratio, while anecdotal claims have been made that measured changes in Utah snow quantity are misleading and do not reflect actual changes."
19495,43,utah,19495,"A 2012 study found that the proportion of winter precipitation (January to March) falling as snow has decreased by nine percent over the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in precipitation and a slight decrease in snowfall."

19512,43,utah,19512,"An exception to note, however, was the unprecedented F2 Salt Lake City Tornado that moved directly through downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999, killing one person, wounding another sixty, and causing approximately $170 million in damage."
19513,43,utah,19513,"The only other victim reported in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on July 6, 1884."

19846,44,vermont,19846," Subsequently, about 400 million years ago, the second period of mountain construction created Green Mountain peaks of 15,000 to 20,000 feet (4,600 to 6,100 m), three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas."
19847,44,vermont,19847,"The geological pressures that created these peaks remain evident as Thrust Champlain, going from north to south to west of the mountains (now the east shore of Lake Champlain)."
19848,44,vermont,19848, This is an example of a geological fault surge where the bedrock is pushed above the formation of more recent rocks.
19849,44,vermont,19849," Due to the tectonic formation, Vermont to the east of the green mountains tends to be formed from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods, and western Vermont mainly from the older Precambrian and Cambrian material."

19866,44,vermont,19866,"It began to reappear in 1998, when ospreys were re-observed locally."
19867,44,vermont,19867,"As of 2010, they were no longer threatened in the state."

19889,44,vermont,19889,The time to type these trees has been reduced to a week in recent years.
19890,44,vermont,19890,"The tree can be replaced by the most aggressive Norwegian maples, forcing sugar maples to ""migrate"" northward to Canada."

20010,44,vermont,20010, Significant changes in political distribution have taken place in Vermont and other affected States.

20013,44,vermont,20013,"Vermont and other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as well as several southern states in those years, which had not been redistributed since the beginning of the century."
20014,44,vermont,20014,"Up to that time, the distribution of the upper chambers was often based on county courts, which had given more power to rural counties and had not taken into account the increase in the population in urban areas."
20015,44,vermont,20015, This arrangement meant that urban areas did not have proportionate political power and often suffered from underinvestment in the necessary infrastructure.

20023,44,vermont,20023," According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2019, the Vermont population was estimated at 623,989."
20024,44,vermont,20024," This includes a natural increase of 3,178 (31,716 births minus 28,538 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 2,432 people outside the State."

20028,44,vermont,20028,"The demographic evolution between those who have multi-generational links with the state and those who are newcomers, bringing different values with them, has led to a certain tension between the two perspectives."
20029,44,vermont,20029," This tension is expressed in the terms, ""Woodchuck"", applied to those established in the state, and ""Flatlander"", applied to newcomers.Vermont is the least populated state of New England."
20030,44,vermont,20030,"In 2012, Vermont was one of only two states in the United States with fewer people than the District of Columbia (Wyoming was the other)."
20031,44,vermont,20031," From 2010 to 2013, 16 of the 251 cities in Vermont experienced population growth."
20032,44,vermont,20032,"All the cities of Chittenden have increased, except Burlington."
20033,44,vermont,20033,"More than 180 cities have experienced a decline, which has not occurred since the mid-19th century."
20034,44,vermont,20034,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnic origin and race, giving a higher overall number."

20043,44,vermont,20043,"Partly because it has a small population for an American state, it has the smallest number of Hispanics from any state in the country."
20044,44,vermont,20044,The lowest percentage of Hispanics was found in West Virginia.
20045,44,vermont,20045,"The linguists have identified the speech patterns found among the Vermonters as belonging to Western New England English, a dialect of New England English, which presents the complete pronunciation of all r sounds, pronouncing horse and wrapping the same, and pronouncing vowels as father and annoying the same, none of which are traditionally shared features in neighboring Eastern New England English."
20046,44,vermont,20046," Some rural speakers realize t as a glottal stop (mitten sounds like ""mi'in"" and Vermont as ""Vermon"")."
20047,44,vermont,20047,"A decreasing portion of the Vermont population, generally rural and masculine, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g.:"
20048,44,vermont,20048," cows with an elevated vowel like [khyz] and climb with a sustained vowel, slightly rounded like [yyd])."
20049,44,vermont,20049," Eastern New England English, also found in New Hampshire, Maine and eastern Massachusetts, was common in eastern Vermont in the mid-20th century and before, but it became rare."
20050,44,vermont,20050," This accent reduces the sound r in words ending in r (the farmer sounds like ""farm-uh"") and adds a r sound to some words ending in a vowel (idea sounds like ""idee-er"") was common."
20051,44,vermont,20051, These features in eastern Vermont appear to have been inherited from the ancestors of West Country and Scottish-Irish.
20052,44,vermont,20052,"In the 21st century, Protestants (30 per cent) and Catholics (22 per cent) made up the majority of those who declared religious preference, with 37 per cent who declared no religion, the highest rate of irreligion in all states."
20053,44,vermont,20053, Other religions contribute no more than two per cent in total.

20083,44,vermont,20083,"In the second half of the 20th century, developers intended to build condos and houses on relatively inexpensive and open land."
20084,44,vermont,20084,The Vermont government responded with a series of development laws and some innovative initiatives to prevent the loss of the Vermont dairy industry.
20085,44,vermont,20085," However, the number of Vermont dairy farms decreased by more than 85% compared to the 11,206 active dairy farms in 1947."

20095,44,vermont,20095,"The dairy stable remains an emblematic image of Vermont, but the 87% decrease in the number of active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003 means that the preservation of dairy stables increasingly depends on a commitment to preserve a legacy rather than a fundamental need in the agricultural economy."
20096,44,vermont,20096,"The Vermont Stable Census, organized in collaboration with state-owned educational and not-for-profit programs and local historical preservation, has developed educational and administrative systems to record the number, state and characteristics of stables throughout Vermont."

20122,44,vermont,20122," Due to a lack of demand, Vermont forests grow twice as fast as they are."
20123,44,vermont,20123,"An important and growing part of Vermont's economy is the manufacture and sale of artisanal foods, fancy foods and novelty items that are being negotiated in part on the Vermont brand, which the state manages and defends."

21064,46,washington,21064,"Frequent rain and cloud cover in western Washington is a major plotting point in the popular Twilight book, which is located in western Washington precisely because of its relative lack of sun."

21074,46,washington,21074,A Mediterranean climate predominates in western Washington and a much drier semi-arid climate prevails east of the Cascade chain.
21075,46,washington,21075,"The main factors that determine Washington's climate are the large semi-permanent high-pressure and low-pressure systems in the northern Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the northern Pacific Ocean, causing a clockwise spiral of air."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means that prevailing northwestern winds bring relatively fresh air and a predictable drought season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In the fall and winter, a low-pressure cyclone system takes over in the northern Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,"The inward spiral air in the opposite direction of the clockwise makes the prevailing winds come from Washington from the southwest, and brings relatively warm and humid air masses and a likely wet season."
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is commonly used to describe the events of the atmospheric river, where repeated storm systems are led by this persistent cyclone in the tropical and near-tropical regions of the Pacific in the northwest Pacific."
21081,46,washington,21081," Although the west of Washington has a marine climate similar to many coastal cities in Europe, there are exceptions such as the events of ""Big Snow"" in 1880, 1881, 1893 and 1916, and the winters of ""deep freezing"" in 1883–84, 1915–1916, 1949–1950 and 1955–1956, among others."

21083,46,washington,21083,"The lowest officially recorded temperature in Seattle is 0°F (−18°C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-lying areas at about three hours from Seattle recorded lows as cold as -48°F (−44°C)."
21084,46,washington,21084,The oscillation of the south greatly influences the weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085," During the El Niño phase, the jet enters the United States further south through California, so late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snow."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet across the Pacific Northwest, so Washington has more rain and snow than average."
21087,46,washington,21087,"In 2006, the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group published The Impacts of Climate Change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities presented, given the possibility of rising global temperatures and their effects on Washington's state."

21090,46,washington,21090,Weeks can pass without clear day.
21091,46,washington,21091,"The west slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the largest annual snowfalls (in some places more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres of water equivalent) in the country."
21092,46,washington,21092,"In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093, Precipitation then increases eastward towards the Rocky Mountains (approximately 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and waterfalls aggravate this climate pattern by causing an orographical uplift of blowing air masses inside the Pacific Ocean, resulting in high levels of precipitation on the wind side of the mountains and low levels on the left side."
21095,46,washington,21095, This occurs most significantly around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases, windward slopes facing the southwest receive high precipitation and mild and cool temperatures."
21097,46,washington,21097," Although the lowlands of the Puget Strait are known for clouds and rain in winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher altitudes."

21102,46,washington,21102," Thus, instead of rainforests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry meadows, shrub steppe and sand dunes."
21103,46,washington,21103,The average annual temperature ranges from 51°F (11°C) on the Pacific coast to 40°F (4°C) in the northeast.

21112,46,washington,21112," Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forest area is owned by the state, including 64 per cent of federal land."
21113,46,washington,21113,"Common trees and plants in the area are camassia, Douglas-fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many species of ferns."
21114,46,washington,21114,"The various wild areas of the state provide a sanctuary, with substantial populations of shorebirds and marine mammals."
21115,46,washington,21115,"The Pacific coasts surrounding the San Juan Islands are heavily populated by white-headed, grey-headed and humpback whales."
21116,46,washington,21116,"In eastern Washington, the flora is very different."
21117,46,washington,21117,Tumbleweeds and sage dominate the landscape in much of the countryside.
21118,46,washington,21118," Russian olive trees and other trees are common on river banks; however, with the exception of river banks, huge parts of eastern Washington have no natural trees at all (although many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course)."

21122,46,washington,21122," This range includes raptors, shorebirds, forest birds, prairie birds, ducks and others."
21123,46,washington,21123," There have also been a large number of species introduced in Washington, D.C., dating back to the early 18th century, including horses and burros."
21124,46,washington,21124,"Catfish, lamprey and channel sturgeon are among the 400 known freshwater fish."

21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicas also began to designate themselves as Cherokees shortly after, showing an apparent additional fusion."

21495,47,west_virginia,21495," Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, it would mean the collapse of the Shattar-Moneton culture."

21518,47,west_virginia,21518," However, the Claypool rebellion of 1780–81, in which a group of men refused to pay the taxes imposed by the Continental Army, testified to the tenacity of the war in what became Western Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,Social conditions in western Virginia were quite different from those in the eastern part of the state.

21522,47,west_virginia,21522," During the American Revolution, the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was presented in Congress, on the grounds that the mountains had an almost impassable barrier to the east."

21527,47,west_virginia,21527, Virginia's leaders have maintained a property qualification to effectively deny the right to vote to poor farmers in the West whose families have done much of the agricultural work themselves.

21530,47,west_virginia,21530,The failure of the Eastern planter elite to carry out constitutional reforms exacerbated East-West sectarianism in Virginia and contributed to its subsequent division.

21537,47,west_virginia,21537," This was made acceptable to the West by a provision that required the General Assembly to resume its representation on the basis of the white population in 1865, or to refer the matter to a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the East has also given itself a tax advantage by demanding a real and real property tax, except for slaves."

21541,47,west_virginia,21541," Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the West, the vote was 75,748 in favour and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542," Most of the opposition came from delegates from the eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the west."

21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men such as lawyer Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont had long flouted under the political domination of the slaves of Tidewater and Piedmont."

21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the 1861 Virginia Secession Agreement voted for the secession of the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwest corner (which eventually became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favour of the secession order, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548," Almost immediately after this vote, a mass meeting in Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to an assembly to meet at Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"At this first meeting, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, although more than a third of the delegates were from the North Panhandle region."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550, Soon there was a division of feelings.
21551,47,west_virginia,21551," Some delegates led by John S. Carlile favoured the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, since Virginia's secession had not yet been adopted by the required referendum (as happened on 23 May), such action would constitute a revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if the Virginians adopted the secession order (of which there was little doubt), another convention, including the elected members of the legislature, would meet at Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On May 23, 1861, the secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted in favour."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on 11 June and stated that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its actions were null and void and all those who had acceded to it had left their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never elected by public ballot to act on behalf of Western Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of its 103 members, 33 were elected to the Virginia General Assembly on 23 May."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557," These included U.S. senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and others who had left their offices to meet at Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558," Other members ""were chosen in an even more irregular way – some at mass meetings, others by county committee and others were apparently self-designated."""
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,A law on the reorganization of the Government was adopted on 19 June.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The next day, the delegates of the assembly chose Francis H. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, and elected other officers of a rival state government and two American senators (Willy and Carlile) to replace the secessionists before adjourning."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,"The federal government in Washington, D.C. quickly recognized the new government and sat on the two new senators."
21562,47,west_virginia,21562," Thus, there were two state governments in Virginia: one promising allegiance to the United States and the other to Confederation."
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The Second Wheeling Convention had been suspended until 6 August, then reconvened on 20 August and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new State and a convention to govern a constitution if the vote were to be in favour."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"In the elections of 24 October 1861, 18,408 votes were cast for the new State and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The results of the elections were questioned, as the Union army occupying the area and the Union troops were stationed in numerous polls to prevent confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"It was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in confederate soldiers' camps, which elected rival state officials, such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567, Most of the pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the North Panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"More than 50,000 votes had been cast on the secession order, but the vote on State status had not exceeded 19,000 votes."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, where Wheeling is located, only a quarter of registered voters voted."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote, since two thirds of West Virginia's territory had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,The majority of the votes in the counties in favour of secession were cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572," Despite this controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to draft a new Constitution for the new state, beginning on 26 November 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573," During this constitutional convention, one Mr. Lamb from Ohio County and one Mr. Carskadon claimed that, in Hampshire County, out of only 195 votes, 39 were expressed by state citizens; the others were illegally deposited by Union soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One of the key figures was Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to create public schools, as well as to limit the movement of slaves to the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The proposal on education was successful, but the convention presented proposals on slavery before completing its work on 18 February 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution is based more closely on the one of Ohio than Virginia, adopting a model of township government rather than Virginia's ""courthouse clicks"" than Carlile criticizes, and a compromise required by the Kanawha region (lawyers Charleston Benjamin Smith and Brown) allows counties and municipalities to vote for subsidies for railways or other improvement agencies."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578,"The resulting instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on 11 April 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,On 13 May 1862 the reorganized state parliament approved the formation of the new state.
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,An application for admission to the Union was submitted to Congress by Senator Waitman Willey of the re-established Virginia government.
21581,47,west_virginia,21581," However, Senator Carlile tried to sabotage the bill, first trying to expand the borders of the new state to include the Shenandoah Valley and then defeat the Willey amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling law was approved by President Abraham Lincoln, who admitted West Virginia, provided that a provision for the progressive abolition of slavery was included in its constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle had insisted with the Wheeling Intelligencer and had also written to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584," While many felt that the admission of West Virginia as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln expressed his opinion on the admission of West Virginia by concluding that ""the organ that consents to the admission of West Virginia is the legislature of Virginia"" and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and timely."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,"The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the request for the abolition of the federal enabling legislation was met."
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,The revised Constitution was adopted on 26 March 1863 and on 20 April 1863 President Lincoln issued a proclamation in which he admitted the state 60 days later on 20 June 1863.
21587,47,west_virginia,21587," Meanwhile, officers from the new state were selected, while Gov."

21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties, located on the Potomac east of the mountains, in 1863, with the agreement of the reorganized Virginia government, voted in favour of annexation to Western Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591, Many voters in counties strongly in favour of secession were absent from the Confederate army at the time of the vote and refused to recognize the transfer upon their return.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly abrogated the act of secession and, in 1866, brought an action against West Virginia by asking the court to declare the counties part of Virginia, which would have declared the admission of West Virginia unconstitutional."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593," Meanwhile, on 10 March 1866, Congress adopted a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court ruled in favour of West Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595," During the Civil War, General Union forces George B. McClellan took possession of most of the territory during the summer of 1861, culminating in the Battle of Rich Mountain, and control of the Union was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863 General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 confederates, raided a considerable part of the state and burned the Pierpont library, although Senator Willey fled their capture."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,"Bands of guerrillas burned and looted in some sections, and were not completely removed until after the end of the war."
21598,47,west_virginia,21598,"The counties of the Eastern Panhandle have been more affected by the war, as military control of the region has changed hands several times."
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The region that became Western Virginia has indeed provided about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, about 22,000 to 25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to remove voting rights from the Confederates' return in order to maintain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said that if it were not enacted, he would lose the election by 500 votes."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of the Confederates could also be confiscated and, in 1866, a constitutional amendment was adopted that deprived all those who had helped and comforted Confederation."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution caused a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,"The democratic party gained control in 1870 and, in 1871, the constitutional amendment of 1866 was repealed."
21605,47,west_virginia,21605,"The first steps towards this change, however, were taken by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,"On 22 August 1872, a new constitution was adopted."
21607,47,west_virginia,21607," From the reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states challenged the state's share of the debts of the pre-war government of Virginia, which had been primarily committed to financing public infrastructure improvements, such as canals, roads and railways, under the direction of the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,"The Virginians, led by former Confederate General William Mahone, formed a political coalition based on this: the Adjustment Party."
21609,47,west_virginia,21609," Although the first constitution of West Virginia provided for the taking over of part of Virginia's debt, the negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were unsuccessful, and in 1871 Virginia financed two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily attributed the rest to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally resolved in 1915, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The last instalment of this amount was paid in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612," After the reconstruction, the new 35th State benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613," Saltpeter caves were used throughout Appalachia for ammunition production; the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the Saltpeter Trail, a chain of limestone caves containing rich calcium nitrate deposits that were returned and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail extends from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the road in the city of Union, Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615," Nearly half of these caves are on the west side of Virginia, including the Organ Cave and Haynes Cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"At the end of the 18th century, Haynes Cave saltpet miners found large animal bones in the deposits."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617," They were sent by a local historian and a border soldier, Colonel John Stuart, to Thomas Jefferson."
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were called Megalonyx jeffersonii, or big claw, and became known as Jefferson's three-finger laziness."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,It was declared the official fossil of the state of Western Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The official rock of the state of West Virginia is bituminous coal, and the official gemstone of the state is silicified fossil Mississippi Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621," Limestone has also produced a useful, generally small, quarry industry, and softer, high-calcium seams have been burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622," This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years, a specific portion of the C & O railway carried limestone to Clifton Forge, Virginia, as an industrial stream."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"The extraction of salt had been under way since the 18th century, although it played largely in the era of the American civil war, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valuable commodity of the first Confederate forces, and later of the Union."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In the years that followed, more sophisticated extraction methods would restore the role of West Virginia as the leading salt producer."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625," However, in the second half of the 19th century, there was still an even larger treasure that was not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626,It would feed much of the industrial revolution in the United States and steam ships from many of the world's marines.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627, Residents (both Amerindians and the first European settlers) had long known the underlying coal and could use it for heating and fuel.
21628,47,west_virginia,21628,"For a long time, however, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629," After the war, with the new railways came a practical method of transporting large quantities of coal to the expansion of U.S. and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630,"As the anthracite mines in northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play during the same period, investors and industrialists concentrated new interests in Western Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted studied potential coal fields and invested in land mining projects and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) railway across the state to the new town of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River coalfield.
21633,47,west_virginia,21633," Soon, the C&O was building its huge wharf at Newport News, Virginia, on the Great Harbour of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new owners of the former Atlantic Railway, Mississippi and Ohio (AM&O), which extended south of Virginia from Norfolk, had clear views of the state of the mountains, where the owners owned vast lands."
21635,47,west_virginia,21635," Their railway was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railway town was developed in Roanoke to manage the planned expansion."
21636,47,west_virginia,21636," After his new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party travelled on horseback and first-hand saw the rich bituminous seam of coal, which Kimball's wife named Pocahontas, the N&W redirected his expansion project to the west to reach it."
21637,47,west_virginia,21637," Soon, the N&W also boarded new coal jetties on Hampton Roads."
21638,47,west_virginia,21638,"In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and western railway lines, the important coal centre of Bluefield, West Virginia, was founded."
21639,47,west_virginia,21639,"The capital of the Pocahontas coalfield, this city will remain the largest city in the southern part of the state for several decades."
21640,47,west_virginia,21640,"He shares a sister town of the same name, Bluefield, Virginia."
21641,47,west_virginia,21641,"In the northern part of the state and elsewhere, the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and other lines have also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities."
21642,47,west_virginia,21642,The B&O developed coal jetties at Baltimore and several locations in the Great Lakes.
21643,47,west_virginia,21643," Other major coal rail carriers include the Western Maryland Railway (WM), Southern Railway (SOU) and the Louisville and Nashville Railway (L&N)."
21644,47,west_virginia,21644,"One delayer, the Virginian Railway (VGN), was particularly notable."
21645,47,west_virginia,21645,"In 1900, only the most rugged terrain in southwestern Virginia was at any distance from existing railways and mining activities."
21646,47,west_virginia,21646,"In this area west of the New River coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties is the Winding Gulf coalfield, later promoted as a billion-dollar coalfield."
21647,47,west_virginia,21647,"Ansted's protégé was William Nelson Page (1854-1932), a civil engineer and mining director in Fayette County."
21648,47,west_virginia,21648,"William A. MacCorkle, former Governor of West Virginia, described him as a man who knew the land ""as a farmer knows a field."""
21649,47,west_virginia,21649," From 1898, Page teamed up with northern and European investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area."
21650,47,west_virginia,21650," They acquired extensive land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short rail line chartered to extend between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka, a distance of approximately 80 miles (130 km)."
21651,47,west_virginia,21651," Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive marine transportation contract by either railway, the managers of the two major railways did not appreciate the project."
21652,47,west_virginia,21652,"In secret collusion, everyone refused to negotiate favorable tariffs with Page, and they did not offer to buy their railway, as they had many other short lines."
21653,47,west_virginia,21653," However, if the presidents of C&O and N&W thought that they could kill the Page project, they had to be wrong."
21654,47,west_virginia,21654,"One of Page's silent investor-partners was the million-dollar industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a director of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust and an old hand in the development of natural resources and transportation."
21655,47,west_virginia,21655,"Master in competitive ""war,"" Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his efforts and also had ""deep pockets."""
21656,47,west_virginia,21656," Instead of abandoning, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks to the east of Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost."
21657,47,west_virginia,21657," With the completion of the Virginian Railway (VGN) in 1909, no fewer than three railways shipped ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads."
21658,47,west_virginia,21658,West Virginia coal was also in high demand in Great Lakes ports.
21659,47,west_virginia,21659,"The NGV and N&W have finally become parts of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the well-designed 21st century NGV lanes continue to provide a favourable gradient for Hampton roads."
21660,47,west_virginia,21660,"As coal mining and related activities became important employment activities in the State, working conditions, safety problems and economic concerns arose."
21661,47,west_virginia,21661," Even in the twenty-first century, mining safety and environmental concerns continue to pose a challenge to the state whose coal continues to supply power plants in many other states."
21662,47,west_virginia,21662," Coal is not the only precious mineral found in West Virginia, as the state was the site of the discovery in 1928 of the 34.48 carat Jones diamond (6.896 g)."
21663,47,west_virginia,21663," Located in the Appalachian Mountains, West Virginia covers an area of 62,754.8 km2, with 62,361.0 km2 of land and 393.8 km2 of water, making it the 41st state of the United States."
21664,47,west_virginia,21664,"West Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest and Kentucky in the southwest."
21665,47,west_virginia,21665," Its longest border is with Virginia at 381 miles (613 km), followed by Ohio at 243 miles (391 km), Maryland at 174 miles (280 km), Pennsylvania at 118 miles (190 km) and Kentucky at 79 miles (127 km)."
21666,47,west_virginia,21666,"West Virginia is entirely located in the Appalachian region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi (""The mounttains are always free"")."
21667,47,west_virginia,21667,Altitude and robustness fall near large rivers such as the Ohio River or the Shenandoah River.
21668,47,west_virginia,21668, About 75% of the state is located in the Cumberland Plateau and the Allegheny Plateau.
21669,47,west_virginia,21669," Although the terrain is not high, the plateau is extremely rugged in most areas."
21670,47,west_virginia,21670,"The average altitude of West Virginia is about 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, which is the highest of all U.S. states east of Mississippi."
21671,47,west_virginia,21671,"On the eastern line of the state with Virginia, high peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region create an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those in northern New England and eastern Canada."
21672,47,west_virginia,21672,"The highest point in the state is the summit of Spruce Knob at 1,482 m (1,863 feet) and is covered in dense spruce boreal forest at altitudes greater than 1,200 m (1,000 feet)."
21673,47,west_virginia,21673, Spruce Knob is located in Monongahela National Forest and is part of Spruce Knob-Senatorca Rocks National Recreation Area.
21674,47,west_virginia,21674,A total of six wild areas are also found in the forest.
21675,47,west_virginia,21675," Outside the forest to the south, the gorge of the New River is a 300 m deep canyon carved by the New River."
21676,47,west_virginia,21676,The National Parks Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the New River Gorge National Park and Reserve.
21677,47,west_virginia,21677, Other areas of protection and management include:
21678,47,west_virginia,21678," Most of West Virginia lies in the mixed ecoregion of the Appalachian Mesophyte forests, while the high elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie in the Appalachian forests and the blue ridge."
21679,47,west_virginia,21679,"The native vegetation of most of the state was originally a mixed forest of hardwood oak, chestnut, maple, beech and white pine, with American willow and sycamore along the state's waterways."
21680,47,west_virginia,21680," Many of these areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact appreciated by native Virginians, who refer to their home as almost paradise (from the song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" by John Denver)."
21681,47,west_virginia,21681," Before the song, it was known as ""The Cog State"" (coal, oil and gas) or ""The Mountain State""."
21682,47,west_virginia,21682,"The underlying rock strata are sandstone, shale, bituminous coal deposits, and limestone laid in an environment close to the coast from sediments from the mountains to the east in a shallow inland sea to the west."
21683,47,west_virginia,21683," Some beds illustrate a coastal swampy environment, a river delta, some shallow waters."
21684,47,west_virginia,21684,"The sea level rose and fell several times during the Mississippi and Pennsylvania eras, giving a variety of rocky strata."
21685,47,west_virginia,21685,"The Appalachians are some of the oldest in the world, having formed more than 300 million years ago."
21686,47,west_virginia,21686,"West Virginia's climate is generally a humid subtropical climate (climate classification of Köppen Cfa, except Dfb at higher altitudes) with warm to hot, humid and cold winters, increasing in severity with altitude."
21687,47,west_virginia,21687, Some regions of the southern highlands also have a temperate mountain climate (Köppen Cfb) where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures slightly cooler.
21688,47,west_virginia,21688," However, time is subject in all parts of the state to change."
21689,47,west_virginia,21689,Hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the Central Appalachian Mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest heights.
21690,47,west_virginia,21690,"In the Eastern Panhandle and Ohio Valley, temperatures are warm enough to see and cultivate subtropical plants such as Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Myrtle Crepe, Albizia julibrisin, American sweetgum and even needle palm and occasional minor sabal."

21698,47,west_virginia,21698,The eastern valleys are less rainy because the ridges of the Allegheny mountains to the west create a partial rain shadow.
21699,47,west_virginia,21699, Just over half of the precipitation occurs from April to September.
21700,47,west_virginia,21700,"Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section, particularly in the Tygart Valley."

21702,47,west_virginia,21702,"In addition to the persistent cloudy sky caused by the degradation of moisture by the Alleghenies, West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation, with an average of snowshoes of nearly 200 days a year with rain or snow."
21703,47,west_virginia,21703,"Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower parts, but may persist for weeks in the upper mountainous areas."
21704,47,west_virginia,21704,"On average, 34 inches (860 mm) of snow fall each year in Charleston, although in the winter of 1995-96, more than three times that amount declined, with several cities in the state setting new snowfall records."
21705,47,west_virginia,21705," Average snowfall in the Highlands of Allegheny can reach up to 180 inches (4,600 mm) per year."
21706,47,west_virginia,21706,"Violent weather is somewhat less prevalent in Western Virginia than in most other eastern states, and is one of the least tornado-like states east of the Rocky Mountains."
21707,47,west_virginia,21707,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the West Virginia population was 1,792,147 as of July 1, 2018, a 3.28 per cent decrease from the 2010 U.S. Census."

22450,49,wyoming,22450,"In addition, copper has been mined in some areas between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the snowline near Grand Encampment."

22454,49,wyoming,22454,"On December 10, 1869, the Governor of the Territory John Allen Campbell extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and, later, the State of the United States, granting women the right to vote."

22471,49,wyoming,22471," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase from the net migration of 4,035 people to the state."

22476,49,wyoming,22476,Wyoming has the second lowest population density in the country (behind Alaska) and is the sparsest population of the 48 contiguous states.
22477,49,wyoming,22477,It is one of only two states (Vermont) with a smaller population than that of the national capital.
22478,49,wyoming,22478," According to the 2000 census, the largest ancestry groups in Wyoming are German (26.0%), English (16.0%), Irish (13.3%), Norwegian (4.3%) and Swedish (3.5%)."
22479,49,wyoming,22479,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnic origin and race, giving a higher overall number."
22480,49,wyoming,22480,"The Wyoming Constitution established three powers: executive, legislative and judicial."

22483,49,wyoming,22483,Wyoming doesn't have a lieutenant governor.
22484,49,wyoming,22484,The Secretary of State is first and foremost in line with the succession.
22485,49,wyoming,22485,The small population of Wyoming earned him only one seat in the United States House of Representatives and thus only three votes in the electoral college.
22486,49,wyoming,22486,"The Wyoming State Liquor Association is the only legal wholesale distributor of government spirits, making it a state of control over alcoholic beverages."

22489,49,wyoming,22489,"Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate court of appeal, like most states."
22490,49,wyoming,22490, This is largely due to the population of the State and the reduction in the corresponding workload.
22491,49,wyoming,22491, Appeals from State district courts are brought directly before the Wyoming Supreme Court.
22492,49,wyoming,22492,"Wyoming also has state district courts (formerly county courts) with limited jurisdiction, which deal with certain types of cases, such as lower-value civil claims, criminal offences and criminal prosecutions."
22493,49,wyoming,22493,Itinerant court judges also hear low-value cases on a regular basis.
22494,49,wyoming,22494," Prior to 1972, Wyoming judges were chosen by popular vote on a non-partisan vote."
22495,49,wyoming,22495," This earlier system was criticized by the State Bar, which requested the adoption of the Missouri Plan, a system designed to balance the independence of the judiciary with judicial accountability."
22496,49,wyoming,22496,"In 1972, an amendment to article 5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which includes an amended version of the plan, was adopted by voters."

22499,49,wyoming,22499,Wyoming's political history defies an easy classification.
22500,49,wyoming,22500,The State was the first to grant women the right to vote and to elect a woman governor.
22501,49,wyoming,22501,"On December 10, 1869, John Allen Campbell, first governor of Wyoming Territory, approved the first law in U.S. history explicitly granting women the right to vote."
22502,49,wyoming,22502, This day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day.
22503,49,wyoming,22503,"On 5 November 1889, voters approved the first constitution in the world that grants women the right to vote in their own right."
22504,49,wyoming,22504," While the state elected notable democrats to the federal office in the 1960s and 1970s, politics became resolutely more conservative since the 1980s, when the Republican Party came to dominate the delegation of the State Congress."
22505,49,wyoming,22505," Today, Wyoming is represented in Washington by his two senators, John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and his only member of the House of Representatives, Liz Cheney, MP."
22506,49,wyoming,22506,All three are Republicans.
22507,49,wyoming,22507,"The state has not voted for a democrat for a president since 1964, one of only eight times since the state status."
22508,49,wyoming,22508," Currently, there is only one relatively reliable democratic county, the rich Teton, and one swing county, Albany College County."
22509,49,wyoming,22509,"In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won his second victory, with 69% of the vote."
22510,49,wyoming,22510, Former Vice-President Dick Cheney is resident in Wyoming and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.
22511,49,wyoming,22511," However, Republicans are dominant at the state level."
22512,49,wyoming,22512, They have been the majority in the Senate since 1936 and in the State House since 1964.
22513,49,wyoming,22513," However, the Democrats held the position of governor for every eight years, except between 1975 and 2011."
22514,49,wyoming,22514,"In particular, Wyoming elected democrat Nellie Tayloe Ross as the first woman in US history to serve as governor of state."
22515,49,wyoming,22515,"She served from 1925 to 1927, winning a special election after her husband, William Bradford Ross, died a little more than a year in her term."
22516,49,wyoming,22516," Republicans have a majority of registered votes in all but two counties: Albany and Teton, where they have a plurality of registered voters."
22517,49,wyoming,22517,"In 2010, 93.39% (474,343) of Wyomingites over 5 years of age spoke English as their main language."

22519,49,wyoming,22519," Other current languages other than English were Algonquian (0.18 per cent), Russian (0.10 per cent), Tagalog and Greek (0.09 per cent)."
