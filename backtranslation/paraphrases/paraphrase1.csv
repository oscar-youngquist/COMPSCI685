122,0,alabama,122,"The continuation of racial discrimination and lynching, the agricultural depression and the failure of cotton crops due to the infestation of ploughs has led tens of thousands of African-Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in the cities of the north and the centre-west during the first decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South."
123,0,alabama,123,"In view of this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see the table ""historical populations"" below) decreased by almost half between 1910 and 1920."

129,0,alabama,129, This changed only in the late 1960s following a trial and court order.
130,0,alabama,130, Industrial development linked to the demands of the Second World War has brought a level of prosperity to the unseen state since before the civil war.
131,0,alabama,131,Rural workers have come to the largest cities in the state to get better jobs and a higher standard of living.

134,0,alabama,134, Cotton and other commercial crops have become less important as the state has developed a base of production and services.
135,0,alabama,135," Despite the massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the predominantly rural legislature refused to renew the seats of the House and Senators according to the population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of the decennial censuses."
136,0,alabama,136, They have maintained their former representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
137,0,alabama,137,"One result was that Jefferson County, home to Birmingham's industrial and economic power, paid more than a third of all tax revenues to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests are constantly underrepresented in Parliament.
139,0,alabama,139," According to a study conducted in 1960, due to rural domination, ""a minority of about 25 per cent of the total population of the State is under the majority control of the Alabama Legislative Assembly""."
140,0,alabama,140,"In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the United States Supreme Court held that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" should be the basis of both chambers of state legislatures, and that their districts should be based on population rather than geographic counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the redistribution of Congress on the basis of the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142," This has benefited the urban areas that have developed, as well as the population as a whole that has been underrepresented for more than sixty years."
143,0,alabama,143, Further changes have been made to the establishment of a representative State House and Senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144," African-Americans continued to lobby in the 1950s and 1960s to end exclusion and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools must be disaggregated, but Alabama was slow to comply."
146,0,alabama,146,"In the 1960s, under the leadership of Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted federal requirements for desegregation."
147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement witnessed significant events in Alabama, including the boycott of the Montgomery buses (1955-1956), the Freedom Rides in 1961 and the Selma marches in Montgomery in 1965."
148,0,alabama,148, They contributed to the adoption and enactment by the U.S. Congress of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
149,0,alabama,149," Legal segregation in the states ended in 1964, but Jim Crow's customs often continued until they were specifically challenged in the courts."
150,0,alabama,150," According to the New York Times, in 2017, many Afro-Americans in Alabama lived in the cities of Alabama such as Birmingham and Montgomery."
151,0,alabama,151,"In addition, the area of the black belt in the centre of Alabama ""shelters largely poor counties that are mainly African-American."
152,0,alabama,152," These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made some changes since the end of the twentieth century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus case of redistriction, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the general vote for seats representing 180 Alabama courts, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155," Voting in general has diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tends to take all seats."
156,0,alabama,156," Although African Americans are an important minority in the state, they have not been able to elect a representative in most jurisdictions in general."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of the settlement of this case, five cities and counties of Alabama, including Chilton County, have adopted a cumulative voting system for the election of representatives in multiple-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158, This has resulted in a more proportional representation of voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in the County of Conecuh."
160,0,alabama,160,"In 1982, the limited vote was first tested in Conecuh County."
161,0,alabama,161," Together, the use of these systems has increased the number of African-American women and women elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens."
162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth state of the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of the total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making the Alabama 23rd in quantity of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the United States."
163,0,alabama,163, Approximately three-fifths of the area is a soft plain with a general descent to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

166,0,alabama,166,"The alabama has a coast in the Gulf of Mexico, in the far south of the state."
167,0,alabama,167,The condition extends from sea-level altitude at Mobile Bay to almost half a mile in the northeast to Mount Cheaha at 2413 feet (735 m).
168,0,alabama,168,"Alabama land consists of 22 million acres (89,000 km2) of forest, or 67 per cent of the total area."

176,0,alabama,176,A 300-metre-wide meteorite hit the region about 80 million years ago.
177,0,alabama,177,"The hills just east of Wetumpka city centre present the eroded remains of the impact crater that was projected into the rocky substrate, with the area marked by the crater or the Wetumpka astroblem (""star-wound"") due to the concentric rings of fractures and areas of broken rocks that can be found under the surface."

347,0,alabama,347,"The basic document of the Alabama Government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901."
348,0,alabama,348," With almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is, according to some, the longest constitution in the world and 40 times longer than the United States Constitution."
349,0,alabama,349, There has been an important movement to rewrite and modernize the Alabama constitution.
350,0,alabama,350," Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains a highly centralized power with the state's legislative power, leaving virtually no power in local hands."
351,0,alabama,351, Most counties do not have a residency rule.
352,0,alabama,352," Any proposed policy change in various areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, often, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353,A criticism of the current Constitution affirms that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
354,0,alabama,354,The government of Alabama is divided into three equal branches.
355,0,alabama,355," Legislative power is the Legislative Assembly of Alabama, a bicameral assembly composed of the 105-member House of Representatives of Alabama, and the 35-member Senator of Alabama."
356,0,alabama,356,"The Legislative Assembly is responsible for writing, debating, adopting or rejecting the laws of the state."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both Houses of the Legislative Assembly.
358,0,alabama,358,The Legislature has the power to derogate from a veto right by a simple majority (most state legislatures need a two-thirds majority to derogate from a veto right).
359,0,alabama,359," Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographical basis by county, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360," Since its constitution was adopted in 1901, it has not redistributed Congressional constituencies; as a result, urbanized areas are severely underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,Nor has it changed the legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses.
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one voice"", ruling that Congressional districts should be recomposed on the basis of censuses (as the state had already included in its constitution but had not implemented)."
363,0,alabama,363,"In addition, the Court decided that the two chambers of the legislative assemblies of the bicameral States should be distributed by population, as there was no constitutional basis for States to have geographical systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other States had to change their legislative districts, as many countries had systems that were underrepresented in urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365, This had caused decades of under-investment in these areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For example, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes provided one third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of the state's funding."
367,0,alabama,367," Through legislative delegations, the Alabama Legislative Assembly maintained control of county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive is responsible for the enforcement and control of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is led by the governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370," Other members of the executive branch include the Cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, the Attorney-General of Alabama, the Secretary of State of Alabama, the Treasurer of Alabama State and the Auditor of Alabama."
371,0,alabama,371,The present governor is Republican Kay Ivey.
372,0,alabama,372, Members of Parliament shall take office immediately after the November elections.
373,0,alabama,373," Government officials, such as the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General and other constitutional officers, took office the following January."
374,0,alabama,374,The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of the State and applying the law in criminal and civil cases of the State.
375,0,alabama,375,The highest court in the State is the Supreme Court of Alabama.
376,0,alabama,376,The Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.
377,0,alabama,377," Since the 1980s, judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized."
378,0,alabama,378,The current Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All judges sitting on the Supreme Court of Alabama are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380," There are two intermediate courts of appeal, the Civil Court of Appeal and the Criminal Court of Appeal, and four courts of first instance: the Circuit Court (court of first instance of general jurisdiction) and the District, Provincial and Municipal Courts."
381,0,alabama,381, Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an extremely high rate of executions.
382,0,alabama,382,It is in Alabama that the death penalty per capita is the highest in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In a few years, it imposes more death sentences than Texas, a state that has a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384," However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385, Some of his cases were very controversial.
386,0,alabama,386,It is the only State to allow judges to disregard jury decisions when applying the death penalty or not.
387,0,alabama,387, This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,Taxes are collected by the income department of Alabama.
389,0,alabama,389,"Alabama collects a tax of 2, 4 or 5% on personal income, depending on the amount earned and production status."
390,0,alabama,390," Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their tax in the state of Alabama, even if they take the standard deduction; those who list it can also deduct the FICA tax (social security tax and health insurance)."
391,0,alabama,391,The general rate of the State's sales tax is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392,City and county sales tax rates are also added to the purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a dinner in Mobile would pay 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"In 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 51 per cent of all government and local revenues, compared with an average of about 36 per cent nationally."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of the seven states that levy a food tax at the same rate as other goods, and one of the two states (the other is the neighbouring Mississippi) that fully taxes the grocery store without any compensatory relief for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most states exempt food from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on working poor families is one of the highest in the United States, Alabama, the only state to levy income tax on a family of four whose income does not exceed $4,600, which is barely a quarter of the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,The Alabama threshold is lowest among the 41 states and the Columbia district with income taxes.
399,0,alabama,399,The corporate tax rate is currently 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400," Overall, the federal, state and local tax burden in Alabama makes the State the second least taxed state in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Property taxes are lowest in the United States.
402,0,alabama,402,The current Constitution of the State requires an electoral referendum to increase property taxes.
403,0,alabama,403,"As Alabama's tax structure is largely dependent on consumer spending, it is subject to a high variable budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit of $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405, There are 67 counties in Alabama.
406,0,alabama,406," Each county has its own elected legislative branch, generally referred to as a county commission."
407,0,alabama,407,He also has limited executive power in the county.
408,0,alabama,408," Due to the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby and Tuscaloosa) of the state have a limited domestic regime."
409,0,alabama,409," Instead, most state counties must press the local Legislative Committee of the State Legislative Assembly for approval of simple local policies, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The State Legislative Assembly retained power over local governments by refusing to adopt a constitutional amendment establishing the system of county origin, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission."
411,0,alabama,411, Legislative delegations retain some powers over each county.
412,0,alabama,412,"In Baker v. Carr (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court demanded that both houses have population-based districts and redistributed after each census, in order to apply the principle of ""one man, one voice""."
413,0,alabama,413," Before that, each county was represented by a state senator, leading to under-representation in the State Senate for the more urbanized and populated counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had failed to redistribute the seats in the state house, affected politics well before the 20th century, not recognizing the growth of industrial cities and urbanised areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The absence of a domestic regime for Alabama counties has led to the proliferation of local legislation allowing counties to do things that are not authorized by the constitution of the state."
416,0,alabama,416,"The constitution of Alabama has been amended more than 700 times, and almost a third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to a single county or city."
417,0,alabama,417,"A significant part of each legislative session is devoted to local legislation, which removes time and attention from legislators matters of national importance."""
418,0,alabama,418,"Alabama is a state of control over alcoholic beverages, which means that the state government has a monopoly on the sale of alcohol."
419,0,alabama,419,The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state.
420,0,alabama,420,"In total, 25 of the 67 counties are ""dry counties"" that prohibit the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in the counties that allow the sale of alcohol."
421,0,alabama,421," During the post-American civil war reconstruction, Alabama was occupied by federal troops in the third military district under the direction of General John Pope."
422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as Redemptors took control of the republican state government, partly by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423," After 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to separate and deprive African-American residents, a process completed in the provisions of the 1901 Constitution."
424,0,alabama,424,The provisions depriving blacks of their right to vote have led to the exclusion of many poor whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"In 1941, more whites than blacks were deprived of their rights: 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total effects have been greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens have been deprived of their rights and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law."
427,0,alabama,427," From 1901 to 1960, the state did not redraw electoral districts as the population increased and moved within the state during the urbanization and industrialization of certain regions."
428,0,alabama,428,"As the counties were at the base of the electoral districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state policy for almost three quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases had to be redistributed in 1972 to be represented on an equal footing."
429,0,alabama,429,"The policy of the state of Alabama received national and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, while whites, bureaucraticly and sometimes violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."
430,0,alabama,430," Governor George Wallace, the only four-man governor of the state, was a controversial figure who committed himself to maintaining segregation."
431,0,alabama,431,"It was only after the adoption of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Electoral Rights Act of 1965 that African Americans regained the capacity to vote, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many countries, they have continued to be excluded from representation by electoral systems in general, allowing the majority of the population to dominate the elections."
433,0,alabama,433, Some changes have taken place at the county level as a result of judicial challenges to establish single-member districts that allow for more diverse representation among county councils.
434,0,alabama,434,"In 2007, the Alabama Legislative Assembly voted, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing ""deep regret"" over slavery and its continued impact."

438,0,alabama,438," With the abandonment of the Blacks in 1901, the state became an integral part of the ""Solid South"", a system in which the Democratic Party functioned as the only viable political party in each southern state."
439,0,alabama,439,"For almost a hundred years, local elections and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, usually with only symbolic Republican contestants running for general elections."

707,1,alaska,707,The Alaska Native Language Centre at the University of Alaska Fairbanks states that there are at least 20 Aboriginal languages in Alaska and that there are also some languages with different dialects.
708,1,alaska,708," Most of Alaska's Aboriginal languages belong either to Eskimo-Aleut language families or to na-dene-language families; however, some languages are considered to be isolates (e.g., English)."

712,1,alaska,712,"In total, 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state, locally known as ""Aboriginal languages""."
713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill formally declaring the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state."
714,1,alaska,714," This bill has given them symbolic recognition as official languages, although they have not been adopted for official purposes within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages that have been included in the bill are as follows:
716,1,alaska,716," According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2010, approximately 34% of Alaskans were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people were identified as evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholics and 32,550 as principal Protestants."

720,1,alaska,720," Alaska has been identified, as well as the Pacific Northwest States Washington and Oregon, as the least religious states in the United States, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,"In 1795, the first Russian Orthodox Church was founded in Kodiak."
722,1,alaska,722, Marriage with Alaskan natives helped Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches have gradually established themselves in Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724, Alaska also has the largest population of Quaker (percentage) in all states.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for which compliance with the halakha could pose particular problems)."
726,1,alaska,726," Hindus in Alaska often share places and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, the Hindus of Alaska established the Sri Gansha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu temple in Alaska and the most northerly Hindu temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728,"It is estimated there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Hindus in Alaska."

731,1,alaska,731,"In the late 1990s, the Anchorage Islamic Community Centre began to build a mosque in Anchorage."
732,1,alaska,732, They opened the ground on a building in the south of Anchorage in 2010 and were about to be completed by the end of 2014.
733,1,alaska,733," Once completed, the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world."
734,1,alaska,734, There is also a Baha'i centre.

737,1,alaska,737," According to a 2013 study conducted by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75%."
738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with over 80% of the government's revenues from oil extraction."
739,1,alaska,739," Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is sea fish, mainly salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture accounts for a very small fraction of Alaska's economy.
741,1,alaska,741," Agricultural production is mainly intended for consumption within the state and includes nurseries, dairy products, vegetables and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742," Manufacturing is limited, with most food and general goods imported elsewhere."
743,1,alaska,743," Employment primarily affects government and industries such as natural resource extraction, marine transportation and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744," Military bases are an important component of the economy of Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island, as well as Kodiak."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746," Its industrial products include crude oil, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other extractive industries, seafood processing, wood and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747, There is also a growing services and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748, Tourists contributed to the economy by supporting local housing.
749,1,alaska,749," Alaska has extensive energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted."
750,1,alaska,750," Significant oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, in February 2014, Alaska had fallen to fourth place in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota and California."
751,1,alaska,751," Prudhoe Bay on the northern slope of Alaska is still the second-high-yielding oil field in the United States, usually producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although at the beginning of 2014, the Bakken North Dakota Formation produced more than 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752," Prudhoe Bay is the largest conventional oil deposit ever found in North America, but it is much smaller than the huge Athabasca oil sands deposit in Canada, which produces approximately 1,500 000 barrels per day in 2014 (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and has hundreds of years of productive reserves at this rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"The Trans-Alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"In addition, significant coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered and technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the northern slope of Alaska."
756,1,alaska,756, Alaska also has some of the country's highest hydroelectric potential from its many rivers.
757,1,alaska,757,Large areas of the Alaskan coast also offer wind and geothermal energy potential.
758,1,alaska,758," Alaska's economy relies heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electricity and light."
759,1,alaska,759," Although wind and hydroelectric power is abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g.:"
760,1,alaska,760,"It was found not to be cost-effective (at the time of reporting, 2001) due to low fuel prices (less than 50¢/gal), long distances, and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of one gallon of gas in urban Alaska is generally thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally much higher, but vary greatly depending on transportation costs, seasonal peaks of use, nearby oil development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is an allocation authorized by the Constitution of Oil Revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus of the state's oil revenues, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans-alaska pipeline network."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the sale of the Prudhoe Bay lease in 1969, for fear that the legislature would spend all the proceeds of the sale (i.e. $900 million) at the same time."
764,1,alaska,764,He was then defended by Governor Jay Hammond and State representative Kenai Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765,"It has always served as an attractive political perspective, diverting revenues that would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaskan Constitution was drafted to discourage the allocation of public funds for a particular purpose.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mainly because of the political climate of distrust that existed at the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768," From its initial capital of $734,000, the fund has increased to $50 billion due to oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769," Most, if not all, of the capital is invested cautiously outside Alaska."
770,1,alaska,770," This has led Alaskan politicians to ask the Fund to invest in Alaska, although such a position has never gained momentum."
771,1,alaska,771," Beginning in 1982, dividends from the annual growth of the fund were paid each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial amount of $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years of payment, since the distribution of payments was suspended in a distribution plan prosecution) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time amount of $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772," Each year, the state legislature withdraws 8% of the earnings, gives 3% to the capital for proof of inflation, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all eligible Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To be eligible for the dividend of the Permanent Fund, one must have lived in the State for at least 12 months, maintain permanent residence subject to authorized absences and not be subject to judicial judgements or criminal convictions that fall within various categories of exclusion or may subject the amount of the payment to civil arrest."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often seen as one of the main examples of a ""core income"" policy in the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the 48 adjacent states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal government employees, particularly U.S. Postal Service (USPS) employees and active members, receive a subsistence allowance normally set at 25% of basic pay because, although the cost of living has decreased, it remains one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska has extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to relatively limited transportation infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778," Due to the northern climate and the short growing season, there is relatively little agriculture in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779," Most of the farms are located either in the Matanuska Valley, about 64 km northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 97 km southwest of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits crops that can be grown, but the long summer sunny days make for productive growing seasons."
781,1,alaska,781,"The main crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural site, particularly the Delta Junction area, about 160 km southeast of Fairbanks, with a large concentration of farms growing agronomic crops, which are mainly to the north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783, This region was largely set aside and developed as part of a state programme led by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784, Crops in the delta area consist mainly of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"To the west of Fairbanks is another concentration of small farms that deal with restaurants, the hotel and tourism industry and community-supported agriculture."
786,1,alaska,786,"In recent years, Alaskan agriculture has seen strong growth in market gardeners, small farms and agricultural markets, with the largest percentage increase (46%) in agricultural market growth in the country in 2011, compared to 17% nationally."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a supply gap elsewhere in the world, filling a niche on the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788," Alaska, with no county, lacks county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789," However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with Alaska's largest state fair in Palmer) take place mainly in late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"Fairs are primarily located in communities with historical or current farming activities, and feature local farmers exhibiting products in addition to more publicized commercial activities such as carnival walks, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792," Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with major fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific."
793,1,alaska,793,Seafood is one of the few foods that are often cheaper within the state than outside.
794,1,alaska,794," Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their domestic food while fishing for subsistence, as well as for sport."
795,1,alaska,795," This includes fish caught by hook, net, or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Subsistence hunting, mainly caribou, moose and Dall sheep, is still common in the state, particularly in the remote communities of Bush."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of a traditional indigenous diet is Akutaq, the Eskimo Ice Cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798," Alaska reindeer farming focuses on the Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with domesticated reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799," Most foods in Alaska are transported to the state from outside, and shipping costs make food relatively expensive in cities."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, hunting and subsistence gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitive."
801,1,alaska,801," Although most of the small towns and villages in Alaska are along the coast, the cost of importing food into remote villages can be high, due to terrain and difficult road conditions, which change significantly due to changes in climate and precipitation."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transportation can reach up to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult periods, if these locations can be reached at all during these adverse weather conditions and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering an American gallon (3.8 L) of milk is approximately $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"The cost of fuel per gallon is consistently twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous average of the United States, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805, Alaska has few road links compared to the rest of the United States.
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road network covers a relatively small area of the state, connecting the central population centres and the Alaska Highway, the main exit route to the state across Canada."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a motor ferry; for decades this has sparked a debate about moving from the capital to a city on the road network, or the construction of a road link from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,The western part of Alaska does not have a highway system linking communities to the rest of Alaska.
809,1,alaska,809,"The Interstate Highway in Alaska consists of a total of 1,082 miles."
810,1,alaska,810,"One of the unique features of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an Alaskan railway tunnel in operation recently renovated to provide an asphalt road link with the isolated community of Whittier, on Prince William Strait, to Seward Road, approximately 80 km southeast of Anchorage, Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 4.0 km, the tunnel was North America's longest road tunnel until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812,The tunnel is North America's longest road and rail tunnel.
813,1,alaska,813," Built around 1915, the Alaskan Railway (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska during the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It connects North Pacific ships by providing critical infrastructure with routes from Seward to the interior of Alaska through south-central Alaska, through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and the North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815," Cities, villages and the area served by the ARR are known throughout the State as the ""railway belt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the steady improvement of the asphalt road network has begun to overshadow the importance of the railway to the Alaskan economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railway played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight to Alaska while transporting natural resources south, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy at Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,It is well known for its summer tourism service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaska Railway was one of the last railways in North America to use caboters in regular service and still use them on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last flag-stop roads in the country.
821,1,alaska,821,A section of approximately 100 km of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road
822,1,alaska,822," Until the park road was built in the 1970s, the railway provided the only land access to most of the area along its route."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northeastern Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Highway also partly crosses the state from Skagway northward to Canada (British Columbia and Yukon), crossing the border at the White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824," This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise ship in Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was featured in the BBC television series 1983 Great Little Railways.
826,1,alaska,826, Alaska's rail network is not connected to the outside.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The closest link to the North American rail network is the northwestern terminus of Canada's National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and under the age of 48."
829,1,alaska,829, Some private companies operate float service between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830," Many towns and villages in the State do not have access to the road or highway; the only modes of access are air, river or sea transport."
831,1,alaska,831," Alaska's well-developed ferry network (known as Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of the southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832, Ferries carry vehicles as well as passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The network also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada, through the inland crossing to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important maritime link for many communities in the Southeast Prince of Wales area and works in collaboration with Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summer tourism market, primarily linking northwestern Pacific to southeastern Alaska and, to a lesser extent, cities along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska."
836,1,alaska,836,"The population of Ketchikan, for example, fluctuates considerably over many days – up to four large cruise ships can moor there at the same time."
837,1,alaska,837," Cities not served by road, sea or river can only be reached by air, foot, dog sled or snow machine, which represents Alaska's highly developed bush air services, a novelty of Alaska."
838,1,alaska,838,"L'Anchorage and, to a lesser extent, Fairbanks are served by many major airlines."
839,1,alaska,839," Due to limited access to roads, air transportation remains the most efficient form of transport within and outside the State."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed extensive renovation and construction work at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to accommodate the upsurge of tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska welcomed nearly two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841," Regular flights to most commercially viable villages and towns in the state are difficult to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government as part of the essential air services program."
842,1,alaska,842," Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering jet flights in the state (sometimes in combination with cargo and passengers Boeing 737-400) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional centres such as Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak and other large communities, as well as to large communities in the southeast and the Alaska Peninsula."
843,1,alaska,843,"The majority of the remaining commercial flights come from small regional transportation companies such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"Smaller towns and villages have to rely on regular or chartered bush services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845," Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska mail bypass program, which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to rural Alaskan communities."
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires that 70% of this subsidy be granted to carriers that provide passenger transportation services to communities.
847,1,alaska,847, Many communities have smaller air taxi services.
848,1,alaska,848, These transactions stemmed from the demand for personalized transportation to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849, Perhaps the most quintessence aircraft in Alaska is the bush seaplane.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights to remote villages without airstrips carry passengers, freight and many items from stores and warehouse clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,"In 2006, Alaska had the largest number of per capita pilots in any U.S. state."
852,1,alaska,852, Another method of transport in Alaska is the dog sled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (i.e., any time after the mid-1920s), dog mushing is more a sport than a means of transportation."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are organised around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod sled dog race, a trail of 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum race in Nome in which moshers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicines very necessary to the diphtheria community of Nome when all the other means of transport had failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from around the world come to Anchorage every March to fight for money, prizes and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that follows more precisely the route of the famous 1925 relay, starting from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) in Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by off-road vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as is commonly known in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859,The Internet and other data transportation systems in Alaska are largely provided by the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and, at the end of 2011, Alaska Communications announced that it has ""two fibre optic pathways down 48 and two more across Alaska."
861,1,alaska,861,"In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was planned, partly supported by $350 million in federal government stimulus."
862,1,alaska,862," Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive power composed of the Governor of Alaska and his appointed persons who are head of executive departments; a legislative power composed of the House of Representatives of Alaska and Senators of Alaska; and a judicial power composed of the Supreme Court of Alaska and lower courts."
863,1,alaska,863,"The state of Alaska employs about 16,000 people throughout the state."
864,1,alaska,864,The Legislative Assembly of Alaska consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senator.
865,1,alaska,865, Senators are appointed for a term of four years and two members of the House of Commons.
866,1,alaska,866,The Governor of Alaska has a four-year term of office.
867,1,alaska,867,"The Lieutenant Governor presents himself separately from the Governor in the primaries, but in the general election, the candidate for governorship and the candidate for lieutenant governor stand together on the same note."
868,1,alaska,868,"The Alaskan judicial system has four levels: the Alaskan Supreme Court, the Alaskan Court of Appeal, the Superior Courts, and the District Courts."
869,1,alaska,869,The superior and district courts are courts of first instance.
870,1,alaska,870," Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts only deal with certain types of cases, including criminal cases and civil cases with a maximum value of $100,000."
871,1,alaska,871,The Supreme Court and Court of Appeal are courts of appeal.
872,1,alaska,872,"The Court of Appeal is required to hear appeals from certain decisions of the lower courts, including those relating to criminal prosecution, juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus."
873,1,alaska,873,"The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and, at its discretion, hears criminal appeals."
874,1,alaska,874," Although in its early years of the state of Alaska was a democratic state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as Republican-Leaning."
875,1,alaska,875,"Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use planning, fishing, tourism and individual rights."

2524,5,colorado,2524," Most of Colorado consists of mountains, foothills, high plains and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,The mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect the local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a rule, with an increase in altitude comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeastern, eastern and southeastern Colorado are mostly the high plains, while northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills and mountains."

2531,5,colorado,2531,"The area is known for its abundant sun and cool and light nights, giving this area a large range of average daytime temperature."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable because the heat dissipates in the space during the clear nights, the thermal radiation being not trapped by the clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, home to most of Colorado's population, is in a shadow of heavy rainfall because it is on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this area can have many days above 95°F (35°C) and often 100°F (38°C)."

2536,5,colorado,2536," Approximately 75% of precipitation occurs during the growing season, from April to September, but this region is highly drought-prone."
2537,5,colorado,2537," Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and large snowstorms that occur in winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538," Otherwise, winters tend to be usually dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,"In a large part of the region, Mars is the most snowy month."
2540,5,colorado,2540,"The months of April and May are normally the wettest, while April is the wettest in total."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"The cities of Front Range closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in winter due to Chinook winds that warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70°F (21°C) or higher in winter."

2545,5,colorado,2545, Locations a few kilometres apart can experience a completely different time depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546," Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, which is not the case with the eastern plains, which move to an alpine climate at the highest altitudes."
2547,5,colorado,2547,"Microclimates also exist in local areas that cover almost the full spectrum of climates, including subtropical highlands (Cfb/Cwb), wet subtropicals (Cfa), wet continentals (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterraneans (Csa/Csb) and subarctics (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548," Extreme climate change is common in Colorado, although a significant portion of extreme climate change occurs in the less populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549," Storms are common east of the continental ditch in spring and summer, but are usually short."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"The hail is a common view in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern plains, especially the northeastern part of the State."
2551,5,colorado,2551,"Hail is the most frequently reported serious weather hazard for the warm season and occasionally causes human injury, as well as significant damage to property."
2552,5,colorado,2552,The eastern plains are prone to some of the largest hailstorms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553,"An example is the violent hailstorms that struck Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the most costly in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The eastern plains are part of the extreme west of the Tornado gangway; some harmful tornadoes on the eastern plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town in 2008."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern plains see particularly frequent tornadoes, whether from mesocyclones in thunderstorms of supercells or less intense cutlets, such as in the Denver convergence vorticity zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,"The plains are also exposed to occasional flooding and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused by both thunderstorms and the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather."
2557,5,colorado,2557,"Notable examples include the Denver flood in 1965, the Big Thompson flood in 1976, and the Colorado floods in 2013."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common in the summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's 1901 record for consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken in the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record of nearly a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561," Much of Colorado is very dry, with an average of only 17 inches (430 millimetres) of precipitation per year on a state-wide basis."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely experiences a period when part of it is not in a certain degree of drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563," Lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of forest fires in the state, such as the 2002 Hayman Fire."
2564,5,colorado,2564," Other notable fires include the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, the Waldo Canyon Fire, and the June 2012 High Park Fire, and the June 2013 Black Forest Fire."
2565,5,colorado,2565," Even these fires were overtaken by the pine mulch fire, the Cameron Peak fire, and the Eastern Troublefire in 2020, all of which are the three largest fires in Colorado history (see Colorado forest fires in 2020)."
2566,5,colorado,2566," However, some of Colorado's mountainous regions receive a large amount of moisture from winter snowfall."
2567,5,colorado,2567,"The spring melting of these snows often causes large flows of water in the Yampa River, Colorado River, Rio Grande, Arkansas River, North Platte River and South Platte River."
2568,5,colorado,2568,"Water flowing from the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very important source of water for farms, towns and cities in the southwestern states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada, as well as for the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas."
2569,5,colorado,2569,A significant amount of water is also diverted to be used in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and regularly) water flows reach northern Mexico.
2570,5,colorado,2570,"The highest official ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115°F (46.1°C) on July 20, 2019, at the John Martin Dam."

3340,7,delaware,3340," While the two southern counties have always been predominantly agricultural, New Castle is more urbanized."
3341,7,delaware,3341,"In the same vein as Maryland, Delaware's geography, culture and history combine elements from the Middle Atlantic, North-East and South regions of the country."
3342,7,delaware,3342," Before its shores were explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Amerindians, including Lenape to the north and Nanticoke to the south."
3343,7,delaware,3343,"It was first colonized by Dutch merchants in Zwaanendael, near the present town of Lewes, in 1631."
3344,7,delaware,3344,Delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the American Revolution.
3345,7,delaware,3345,On 7 December 1787 Delaware became the first State to ratify the United States Constitution and has since been known as the First State.
3346,7,delaware,3346," Since the beginning of the 20th century, Delaware has also been a de facto paradise on the coast, in which, under its corporate laws, the state is home to more than 50% of all companies listed NYSE and 60% of Fortune 500."
3347,7,delaware,3347,"The state is named after the Delaware River, which in turn derives its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577–1618), governor of the colony of Virginia at the time when Europeans first explored the river."
3348,7,delaware,3348,"The Delaware people, a name used by Europeans for the native Lenaps of the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source."
3349,7,delaware,3349,La Warr's last name comes from Sussex and is of Anglo-Normanian origin.
3350,7,delaware,3350,It probably comes from a place called the Norman War.

3354,7,delaware,3354,"Delaware is 154 kilometres long and 14 to 56 kilometres long, making it the second smallest state in the United States after Rhode Island."
3355,7,delaware,3355,"Delaware is limited to the north by Pennsylvania; to the east by Delaware River, Delaware Bay, New Jersey and Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by Maryland."
3356,7,delaware,3356,Small portions of Delaware are also located on the east side of Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey.
3357,7,delaware,3357,"Delaware, along with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia, form the Delmarva Peninsula, which extends along the mid-Atlantic coast."
3358,7,delaware,3358,The definition of the northern limit of the state is unusual.
3359,7,delaware,3359, Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by a 12-mile arch (19.3 km) of the New Castle City Courthouse dome.
3360,7,delaware,3360, This limit is often referred to as the circle of twelve miles.
3361,7,delaware,3361," Although the circle of twelve miles is often considered the only territorial border in the United States that is a true arc, the Mexican border with Texas includes several arches, and many cities in the South (such as the plains, Georgia) also have circular borders."
3362,7,delaware,3362," This boundary extends to the east to the low point on the shore of New Jersey, then continues south along the shore until it again reaches the 12 mile (19 km) arc in the south; and then the boundary continues more conventionally in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River."
3363,7,delaware,3363,"To the west, part of the arc extends beyond the east end of Maryland."
3364,7,delaware,3364,The rest of the western border runs slightly east of the south due from its intersection with the arc.
3365,7,delaware,3365,"Land between the northwestern part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed."
3366,7,delaware,3366,"The Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest average elevation of any state in the nation."
3367,7,delaware,3367," Its highest altitude, located in Ebright Azimuth, near Concord High School, is less than 450 feet (140 m) above sea level."
3368,7,delaware,3368,The northernmost part of the State is part of the plateau of Piedmont with its hills and rolling surfaces.
3369,7,delaware,3369,"The fall line of the Atlantic coast follows approximately the Robert Kirkwood road between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road lies the Atlantic coastal plain with flat, sandy soil and, in some parts, marshy."
3370,7,delaware,3370,A ridge of approximately 75 to 80 feet (23 to 24 m) extends along the western boundary of the state and separates watersheds that feed the Delaware River from the bay to the east and Chesapeake Bay to the west.
3371,7,delaware,3371," Like almost all Delaware is part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate."
3372,7,delaware,3372,The condition is found in the humid subtropical climate zone.
3373,7,delaware,3373," Despite its small size (approximately 160 km) between its northernmost and southernmost points, the average temperature and amount of snowfall vary considerably between Sussex County and New Castle County."
3374,7,delaware,3374," Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern part of the state has a milder climate and longer growing season than the northern part of the state."

3376,7,delaware,3376,The record record for all times of -17°F (−27°C) was also recorded in Millsboro on 17 January 1893.
3377,7,delaware,3377,The hardiness zones are 7a and 7b.
3378,7,delaware,3378,The Delaware transition climate supports a wide variety of vegetation.
3379,7,delaware,3379,In the northern third of the state there are northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States.
3380,7,delaware,3380,In the south of two thirds of the state there are mid-Atlantic coastal forests.
3381,7,delaware,3381,"Trap Pond State Park, as well as other areas of Sussex County, for example, are home to bald cypress stands in northern North America."
3382,7,delaware,3382,"Delaware provides government subsidies for the clean-up of ""lightly contaminated"" property with hazardous waste, the product of which is derived from a wholesale oil sales tax."
3383,7,delaware,3383," Before Delaware was colonized by European settlers, the area housed the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mainly along the coast, and the Nanticokes who occupied much of the southern Delmarva peninsula."
3384,7,delaware,3384,"John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of Nanticoke – they may have retained small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating to Chesapeake Bay."
3385,7,delaware,3385,The Kuskarawocks were probably the Tuscaroras.
3386,7,delaware,3386,The Unami Lenape of the Delaware Valley were closely linked to the Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River.
3387,7,delaware,3387," They had a well-established hunting and farming society, and they quickly became intermediaries in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their former enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock."
3388,7,delaware,3388," With the loss of their land on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wanted to remain identified as such left the area and moved to the Alleghany Mountains in the mid-18th century."
3389,7,delaware,3389,"In general, those who did not move out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christians and were regrouped with others of colour in official documents and in the minds of their non-Aboriginal American neighbours."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the current Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post in Zwaanendael, near the Lewes site in 1631."
3391,7,delaware,3391,"In less than a year, all the settlers were killed in a dispute with the Amerindian tribes of the region."
3392,7,delaware,3392,"In 1638, a new Sweden, a trading post and a Swedish colony, was established in Fort Christina (now Wilmington) by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch."
3393,7,delaware,3393,The colony of New Sweden lasted for 17 years.
3394,7,delaware,3394,"In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at the present time New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the colony of New Sweden, annexing it to the Netherlands New Land."
3395,7,delaware,3395," Nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the leadership of James, the Duke of York."
3396,7,delaware,3396," Combating an earlier claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, owner of Maryland, the Duke transmitted his somewhat doubtful property to William Penn in 1682."
3397,7,delaware,3397,"Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his province of Pennsylvania and rented what was then known as the Duke's ""Delaware Low Counties."""
3398,7,delaware,3398,Penn established a representative government and briefly combined its two possessions under a single General Assembly in 1682.
3399,7,delaware,3399," However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had become so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the consent of the lower counties, and the two groups of representatives began to meet alone, one in Philadelphia, and the other in New Castle."
3400,7,delaware,3400,Penn and his heirs remained owners of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties.
3401,7,delaware,3401,The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same Governor was not unique.
3402,7,delaware,3402, From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.
3403,7,delaware,3403, Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for a period of time.
3404,7,delaware,3404," Depending on the early years of contract work, Delaware imports more slaves while the number of English immigrants declines with better economic conditions in England."
3405,7,delaware,3405,"The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a commercial culture, although English immigrants continued to arrive."
3406,7,delaware,3406," Like the other middle colonies, the lower counties of Delaware first showed little enthusiasm for a breakup with Britain."
3407,7,delaware,3407," Citizens had good relations with the owner government, and they were generally given more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies."
3408,7,delaware,3408,The merchants at Wilmington harbour had commercial ties with the British.
3409,7,delaware,3409," This is how New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and John Dickinson, from Kent County, became the ""Penman of the Revolution""."
3410,7,delaware,3410,"Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, patriotic leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separate from British domination and Pennsylvania on 15 June 1776."

3421,7,delaware,3421,The economies of these colonies were mainly based on labour-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves due to a decline in working-class immigrants from England.
3422,7,delaware,3422," Most English settlers had arrived as contract servants (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between the servant and the slave was fluid."
3423,7,delaware,3423, Most Afro-American families free from Delaware before the Revolution had emigrated from Maryland to find more affordable land.

4280,9,georgia,4280,"In the 1960s, the proportion of African-Americans in Georgia had fallen to 28 per cent of the population of the state, after waves of migration to the north and some emigration by whites."

4286,9,georgia,4286,"In 1972, the Georgians elected Andrew Young to Congress as the first African-American MP since the time of reconstruction."
4287,9,georgia,4287,"In 1980, the expansion of the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) was completed."
4288,9,georgia,4288,"The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than 100 million passengers per year."
4289,9,georgia,4289,"The airport, which employs over 60,000 people, has become a major driver of economic growth."
4290,9,georgia,4290," With the benefits of cheap real estate, low taxes, the right to work and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, Atlanta's metropolitan area has become a national centre for finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, logistics and transportation, as well as film, convention and trade fair companies."

4294,9,georgia,4294," From the Atlantic Ocean, the eastern border of the state with South Carolina goes up the Savannah River from the northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Senatorca rivers."
4295,9,georgia,4295,"It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and in the Chattooga River, its largest tributary."
4296,9,georgia,4296, These limits were decided in the Treaty of Beaufort of 1797 and tested by the Supreme Court of the United States in both Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989.
4297,9,georgia,4297,"The boundary then rotates strongly around the end of Rabun County at 35° north latitude, although from this point it diverges slightly southward (because of inaccuracies in the initial survey)."
4298,9,georgia,4298," This northern border was originally the border of Georgia and North Carolina to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was separated from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies encouraged the Georgian legislature to pass a law, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell most of Georgia's territory, which currently includes Alabama and Mississippi."
4299,9,georgia,4299,The western border of the state runs straight to the southeast from a point southwest of Chattanooga to the Chattahoochee River near West Point.
4300,9,georgia,4300,"It continues downwards to the point where it joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming the Apalachicola River of Florida); the south border goes almost full east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the St. Mary's River, which then forms the rest of the border back to the ocean."
4301,9,georgia,4301,Water limits are always fixed to be the original thalweg of rivers.
4302,9,georgia,4302," Since then, many have been flooded by lakes created by dams, including Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint under Seminole Lake."
4303,9,georgia,4303," Georgian legislators claimed that, during an investigation in 1818, the state border with Tennessee was wrongly placed a mile (1.6 km) further south than expected, and they continue to challenge it."

4305,9,georgia,4305, Each region has its own features.
4306,9,georgia,4306,"For example, the ridge and valley, located in the northwest corner of the state, include limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which produced building limestone, barite, ocher and small amounts of coal."

4321,9,georgia,4321,"The extent to which the time of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico, and altitude."
4322,9,georgia,4322," This latter factor occurs mainly in mountainous areas in the northern part of the state, which are more distant from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level."
4323,9,georgia,4323,The hardiness zones of USDA plants for Georgia range from zone 6b (not colder than -5°F (−21°C)) in Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b (not colder than 15°F (−9°C)) along the Atlantic coast and the Florida border.

4325,9,georgia,4325," Georgia is one of the main states of the frequency of tornadoes, although they are rarely stronger than the EF1."
4326,9,georgia,4326," Although the tornadoes that hit the city are very rare, an EF2 tornado struck downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings."
4327,9,georgia,4327," With a coast on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century."
4328,9,georgia,4328," Georgia is often hit by hurricanes that hit the Florida Panhandle, weaken on land and bring strong winds of tropical storms and heavy rains inside, a recent example being Hurricane Michael, as well as hurricanes that are approaching the Georgian coast, brushing the coast on their way north without ever making a landfall."
4329,9,georgia,4329, Hurricane Matthew 2016 and Hurricane Dorian 2019 did.
4330,9,georgia,4330," Because of anthropogenic climate change, Georgia's climate is warming."
4331,9,georgia,4331," This situation is already causing major disturbances, for example, due to sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable than many other states because its lands are sinking) and warming will continue to increase."
4332,9,georgia,4332,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that in 2019, Georgia had 10,617,423 inhabitants, an increase of 97,948 over the previous year, and an increase of 929,770 (9.60%) since 2010."
4333,9,georgia,4333," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438,939 (849,414 births minus 410,475 deaths) and an increase from the net migration of 606,673 persons in the state."
4334,9,georgia,4334,"Immigration has resulted in a net increase of 228,415 people, and migration within the country has resulted in a net increase of 378,258 people."
4335,9,georgia,4335,"In 2010, the number of illegal immigrants living in Georgia more than doubled, reaching 480,000 between January 2000 and January 2009, according to a federal report."
4336,9,georgia,4336, This gave Georgia the largest percentage increase among the 10 states with the largest populations of illegal immigrants in those years.

4341,9,georgia,4341, Hispanics and Latinos of all races made up 8.8% of the population.
4342,9,georgia,4342,"In 2011, 58.8 per cent of the Georgian population under one year of age were minorities (i.e. they had at least one non-Hispanic white parent) compared to other states such as California with 75.1 per cent, New York with 55.6 per cent and Texas with 69.8 per cent."
4343,9,georgia,4343,The largest groups of European descent are:
4344,9,georgia,4344,"At the 1980 census, 1,584,303 Georgians claimed English ancestry out of a total population of 3,994,817, making it 40 per cent of the state and the largest ethnic group at the time."
4345,9,georgia,4345," Today, many of these same people claiming to be of ""American"" descent are actually of English origin, and some of them are of Scottish origin; however, their families have been living in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify themselves simply as having an ""American"" ancestry or do not actually know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346," Their ancestry dates mainly to the thirteen colonies of origin and, for this reason, many of them are now content to claim ""American"" ancestry, although they are mainly of English origin."
4347,9,georgia,4347,"In 2004, 7.7 per cent of the Georgian population were under 5 years of age, 26.4 per cent under 18 years of age and 9.6 per cent at least 65 years of age."
4348,9,georgia,4348,"In 2004, women accounted for about 50.6 per cent of the population and African Americans for about 29.6 per cent."
4349,9,georgia,4349," Historically, about half of the Georgian population was made up of African-Americans who, before the civil war, were almost exclusively slaves."
4350,9,georgia,4350,The large migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from rural south to industrial north from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African-American population.
4351,9,georgia,4351," Georgia experienced the second fastest growth of the Asian population in the United States from 1990 to 2000, which more than doubled over the ten-year period."
4352,9,georgia,4352,"In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percentage of the total population that is African-American (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and the third in terms of the black digital population after New York and Florida."
4353,9,georgia,4353, Georgia is the third country with the lowest percentage of older persons (65 years or older) at 12.8% (in 2015).
4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonization of a large number of Scottish, English-American and Scottish-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmonts, and coastal colonization by some English-American and Afro-Americans, strongly influenced state culture in food, language and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported into coastal areas in the 18th century on several occasions in rice-growing areas of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the Lower Country among African Americans.
4356,9,georgia,4356," They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture continue more than in other fields."
4357,9,georgia,4357,"In the creolisation of the culture of the South, their food routes have become an integral part of all the cuisine of the South in the Lower Country."
4358,9,georgia,4358,"In 2010, 87.35 per cent (7,666,663) of Georgians aged 5 and over spoke English at home as their primary language, while 7.42 per cent (651,583) spoke Spanish, 0.51 per cent (44,702) Korean, 0.44 per cent (38,244) Vietnamese, 0.42 per cent (36,679) French, 0.38 per cent (33,009) Chinese (including Mandarin) and German, which was spoken as their main language by 0.29 per cent (23,351) of the population aged 5 and over."
4359,9,georgia,4359,"In total, 12.65% (1 109,888) of the Georgian population aged 5 and over spoke a mother tongue other than English."
4360,9,georgia,4360," Atlanta, located in the north-central part of Georgia east of the continental ditch, has been the capital of Georgia since 1868."
4361,9,georgia,4361,"It is Georgia's most populated city, with an estimated population of just over 506,000 in 2019."
4362,9,georgia,4362,"The metropolitan area of Atlanta is the cultural and economic centre of South East; its estimated population in 2019 was over 6 million, or 57% of Georgia's total."
4363,9,georgia,4363, Atlanta is the ninth largest metropolitan region in the country.
4364,9,georgia,4364,"The state has 17 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, according to estimates from the 2019 U.S. Census."
4365,9,georgia,4365," With the rest of the South-East, the Georgian population continues to grow rapidly, with primary gains concentrated in urban areas."
4366,9,georgia,4366,"The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area increased by 1.23 million (24%) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta moved from the eleventh largest metropolitan area of the United States to the ninth largest."
4367,9,georgia,4367,"In Georgia, religious affiliation consists of 70 per cent Protestants, 9 per cent Catholics, 1 per cent Mormons, 1 per cent Jews, 0.5 per cent Muslims, 0.5 per cent Buddhists and 0.5 per cent Hindus."
4368,9,georgia,4368,"Atheists, deists, agnostics and other non-affiliated individuals account for 13% of the population."
4369,9,georgia,4369,"The largest Christian denominations according to the number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,759,317; the Methodist Church united with 619,394; and the Roman Catholic Church with 596,384."
4370,9,georgia,4370,"The non-denominational evangelical Protestant had 566,782 members, the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) had 175,184 members, and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. had 172,982."
4371,9,georgia,4371,"The Presbyterian Church (USA) is the largest presbyterian body in the state, with 300 congregations and 100,000 members."
4372,9,georgia,4372,"The other large body, the Presbyterian Church in America, had 14 congregations and 2,800 members at its founding date; in 2010, it had 139 congregations and 32,000 members."
4373,9,georgia,4373,"The Roman Catholic Church is remarkable in the urban areas of Georgia, and includes the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the diocese of Savannah."

4375,9,georgia,4375," Georgia is home to a number of historical synagogues, including the Temple (Atlanta), the Beth Jacob Congregation (Atlanta) and the Mickve Israel Congregation (Savannah)."
4376,9,georgia,4376,Shabad and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute are also active in the state.
4377,9,georgia,4377," Like all other American states and the federal government, the Georgian government rests on the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial branches."
4378,9,georgia,4378,"The executive power of the State belongs to the governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republican)."
4379,9,georgia,4379,The Governor of Georgia and the Lieutenant Governor are elected by separate ballot for a four-year term.
4380,9,georgia,4380," Unlike the federal government, but like many other American states, most of the leaders in the governor's cabinet are elected by Georgian citizens rather than by the governor."
4381,9,georgia,4381,"The legislative power belongs to the General Assembly, composed of the Senator and the House of Representatives."
4382,9,georgia,4382,"The Lieutenant Governor presides over the senator, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker."
4383,9,georgia,4383,"The Constitution of Georgia provides for a maximum of 56 senators, elected in one-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives distributed among representative districts (sometimes resulting in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives."
4384,9,georgia,4384,The term of office of Senators and Representatives is two years.
4385,9,georgia,4385,The laws promulgated by the General Assembly are codified in the Annotated Official Code of Georgia.

4393,9,georgia,4393,"The counties of Georgia have their own elected legislative power, generally referred to as the Council of Commissioners, which generally also has executive power in the county."
4394,9,georgia,4394," Several counties have one form of commissioner's government, with legislative and executive powers vested in one person."
4395,9,georgia,4395, Georgia is the only State with the current counties of Commissioner Sole.
4396,9,georgia,4396,"The Constitution of Georgia confers on all counties and towns the authority of ""domestic domination""."
4397,9,georgia,4397,"County commissions have considerable power to pass laws in their county, as a municipality would."
4398,9,georgia,4398," Georgia recognizes all local government units as cities, so every city incorporated is legally a city."
4399,9,georgia,4399," Georgia does not provide for cantons or independent cities, although draft laws have been proposed to the Legislative Assembly to provide for cantons; it authorizes county governments consolidated by local referendum."
4400,9,georgia,4400,"All the second-ranked cities of Georgia, with the exception of Savannah, have now formed, by referendum, consolidated county governments: Columbus (in 1970), Athens (1990), Augusta (1995) and Macon (2012)."
4401,9,georgia,4401,(Augusta and Athens excluded one or more small towns within their consolidated borders; Columbus and Macon finally absorbed all small entities within their consolidated borders.)
4402,9,georgia,4402,The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated city-county government after merging with the unincorporated Chattahoochee County in 2003.

4404,9,georgia,4404," There is no real metropolitan government in Georgia, although the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and the Georgia Regional Transportation Administration provide some services, and the CRA must approve all major land use planning projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area."
4405,9,georgia,4405," Georgia voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a series that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020."
4406,9,georgia,4406," Until 1964, the Georgian state government had the longest record of domination of a single party by the Democratic Party of any state in the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407, This record was largely set due to the abandonment of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws at the beginning of the 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408," Some elements, such as the obligation to pay voting taxes and to pass literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted in the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century."
4409,9,georgia,4409,"The White Democrats regained power after the reconstruction, partly thanks to the intimidation and violence of some, but this method fell into disrepute."
4410,9,georgia,4410,"In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a constitutional amendment in 1908, Blacks made up 47% of the population of the state."
4411,9,georgia,4411,"The Whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which, in practice, deprived blacks and poor whites, almost half of the population of the state."
4412,9,georgia,4412,"It required that any man at least 21 years of age wishing to vote: (a) be of good moral character and be able to pass a citizenship test, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the constitutions of the United States and Georgia, or (c) possess at least 40 acres of land or $500 of property."
4413,9,georgia,4413, Any Georgian who had fought in any war of the American Revolution during the Hispano-American war was exempt from these additional qualifications.
4414,9,georgia,4414," Most importantly, any Georgian descendant of a veteran of one of these wars was also exempted."
4415,9,georgia,4415," Because in 1908 many white men in Georgia were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-made whites to vote."
4416,9,georgia,4416,"Good character qualifications, knowledge of citizenship and literacy (all subjectively determined by white registrars) and property were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote."
4417,9,georgia,4417,The lists of electors have fallen dramatically.
4418,9,georgia,4418,"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Progressive encouraged electoral reform and reduced the power of constituency leaders to clean up politics."
4419,9,georgia,4419," Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, have continued to effectively close illiterate people."
4420,9,georgia,4420,The rule of the one-white party has been solidified.
4421,9,georgia,4421,"For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians appointed and elected only white democratic governors, and white democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly."
4422,9,georgia,4422," Most of the Democrats elected throughout those years were Southern Democrats, who were financially and socially conservative according to national standards."
4423,9,georgia,4423, This method of voting continued after the segregation period.
4424,9,georgia,4424, Legal segregation ended with the enactment of federal legislation in the 1960s.
4425,9,georgia,4425," According to the 1960 census, the proportion of the population of Georgia that was African-American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the Great Migration to the North and the Midwest."
4426,9,georgia,4426,New white residents have arrived through migration and immigration.

4691,10,hawaii,4691,The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an underwater magma source called the Hawaii Hotspot.
4692,10,hawaii,4692,"The process continues to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean moves continuously to the northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes."

4715,10,hawaii,4715,The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade field.
4716,10,hawaii,4716,"On a single island, the climate around the coast can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres of annual precipitation) to wet tropical; on the slopes, the environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5100 millimetres per year), to temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold and dry climate."

4723,10,hawaii,4723,"The monument covers approximately 140,000 square kilometres (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls and shallow deep waters up to 80 kilometres off the Pacific Ocean, an area larger than all United States national parks combined."
4724,10,hawaii,4724,"The Hawaii climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme due to the almost constant trade winds of the east."

4731,10,hawaii,4731,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state, at Pahala on April 27, 1931, is 100°F (38°C), making it bound to Alaska as the lowest observed temperature in the U.S. state."
4732,10,hawaii,4732,The record low temperature of Hawaii is 12°F (−11°C) observed in May 1979 at the summit of Mauna Kea.
4733,10,hawaii,4733, Hawaii is the only state that has ever recorded Fahrenheit subzero temperatures.

4739,10,hawaii,4739, Hawaii was admitted as an American state on 21 August 1959.
4740,10,hawaii,4740,"On the basis of archaeological evidence, the first habitation in the Hawaiian Islands dates back to about 300 AD, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands."
4741,10,hawaii,4741,A second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora occurred in the 11th century.
4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of the human discovery and residence of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of an academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743," Some archaeologists and historians believe that it is a wave of immigrants from Tahiti around the year 1000 that introduced a new line of high leaders, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the construction of heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744, This subsequent immigration is detailed in the Hawaiian mythology (mo-olelo) about Pa-ao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745, Other authors argue that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence of a subsequent influx of Tahitian settlers and that Pa'ao must be considered a myth.
4746,10,hawaii,4746,"The history of the islands is marked by a slow and steady growth of the population and the size of the capitals, which has developed to encompass entire islands."
4747,10,hawaii,4747,"The local leaders, called alii, governed their colonies and waged wars to expand their influence and defend their communities against predatory rivals."

4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the archipelago ""Sandwich Islands"" in honour of his godfather John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the location of the islands and making the indigenous name Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form ""Owyhee"" or ""Owhyhee"" is preserved on behalf of certain locations in the U.S. Northwest Pacific, including Owyhee County and the Owyhee Mountains at Idaho, named after three Hawaiian Aboriginal members of a trap group that has disappeared in the area."
4752,10,hawaii,4752,"It is very possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian islands in the 16th century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778."
4753,10,hawaii,4753,"Ruy López de Villalobos ordered a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano on board as a pilot."
4754,10,hawaii,4754," According to interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe a meeting with Hawaii or the Marshall Islands."
4755,10,hawaii,4755," If the crew of Villalobos had spotted Hawaii, Gaetano would be considered the first European to see the islands."
4756,10,hawaii,4756, Some researchers rejected these allegations because of a lack of credibility.
4757,10,hawaii,4757," Nevertheless, the Spanish archives contain a map that represents the islands at the same latitude as Hawaii, but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands."

5193,11,idaho,5193," With a population of approximately 1.7 million and an area of 33,570 square miles (216,400 km2), Idaho is the 14th largest, the 12th least populated and the 7th least populated of the 50 American states."
5194,11,idaho,5194,The capital of the State and the largest city is Boise.
5195,11,idaho,5195,For thousands of years Idaho has been inhabited by Amerindian peoples.
5196,11,idaho,5196,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Idaho was considered to be part of Oregon, a disputed region between the United States and the British Empire."
5197,11,idaho,5197,"It officially became American territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho territory was organized only in 1863, instead of being included for periods in the Oregon Territory and the Washington Territory."
5198,11,idaho,5198,"Idaho was finally admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd state."
5199,11,idaho,5199,"As part of the Pacific Northwest (and the associated Cascadia bioregion), Idaho is divided into several distinct geographical and climatic regions."
5200,11,idaho,5200,"The northern state, the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle, is closely linked to the east of Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone – the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone."

5208,11,idaho,5208,"The official nickname of the state is the ""Gem State"", which refers to the natural beauty of the Idaho."
5209,11,idaho,5209,The origin of the name is a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the U.S. Congress planned to organize a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician who presented himself as an unrecognized delegate of the unofficial territory of Jefferson."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a Shoshone term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""the name of the mountains"", but it was later revealed that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he was inspired to give the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"As the name seemed to be made, the U.S. Congress finally decided to appoint the Colorado Territory region instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time that decision was made, the city of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been appointed according to Willing's proposal."
5213,11,idaho,5213," That same year, Congress created Colorado Territory, a county called Idaho County, which was established in eastern Washington."
5214,11,idaho,5214,"The county was named after a steamship called Idaho, which was launched on the Columbia River in 1860."
5215,11,idaho,5215,It is unclear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was revealed.
5216,11,idaho,5216,"In any event, part of Washington's territory, including Idaho County, was used to create the Idaho Territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217," Finally, the name was given to the Idaho territory, which later became the American state."
5218,11,idaho,5218," Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well in the 20th century repeated as Willing's narrative the name ""Idaho"" derived from the term Shoshone ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,A 1956 Idaho History Manual says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"An alternative to etymology attributes the name to the Plains Apache word ""ídaahęя"" IPA: [í.ta=.h=""] (enemy) which was used in reference to the Comanche."

5237,11,idaho,5237,"The plain served as an easy passage through the Rocky Mountains for settlers westbound on the Oregon Trail, and many settlers chose to settle in the area rather than risk the perfidious road through the Blue Mountains and the Cascade Range to the west."
5238,11,idaho,5238,"The western region of the plain is known as the Treasure Valley, linked between the Owyhee Mountains in the southwest and the Boise Mountains in the northeast."

5251,11,idaho,5251," Although the western border of the state is about 350 miles (560 km) from the Pacific Ocean, maritime influence is still felt in Idaho, especially in winter when cloud cover, humidity and precipitation are at their peak."
5252,11,idaho,5252," This influence has a moderate effect in winter, where temperatures are not as low as might be expected in a northerly state where altitudes are primarily high."
5253,11,idaho,5253," Maritime influence is less pronounced in the eastern part of the state where rainfall is often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid continental climate."
5254,11,idaho,5254,"Idaho can be warm, although prolonged periods of more than 98°F (37°C) are rare, with the exception of the lowest point of altitude, Lewiston, who sees little snow as a result."
5255,11,idaho,5255,"The warm summer days are tempered by low relative humidity and cooler evenings during the summer months since, for most states, the greatest diurnal temperature difference is often in summer."
5256,11,idaho,5256,"Winters may be cold, although long periods of bitter cold below zero are unusual."
5257,11,idaho,5257,The highest temperature of Idaho at 118°F (48°C) was recorded at Orofino on 28 July 1934; the lowest temperature of Idaho at -60°F (−51°C) was recorded at Island Park Dam on 18 January 1943.

5263,11,idaho,5263,"The discoverers, anthropology professor Loren Davis and his colleagues, pointed out that they have similarities with the tools and artifacts discovered in Japan 16,000 to 13,000 years ago."
5264,11,idaho,5264,"The discovery also showed that the first people might not have come to North America by land, as has already been said."

5272,11,idaho,5272,"The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed the Idaho in 1805 on the Pacific Road and in 1806 on the return, largely following the two directions of the Clearwater River."
5273,11,idaho,5273,"The first non-Aboriginal settlement was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Pend Oreille Lake for the fur trade in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company."
5274,11,idaho,5274,"In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, then working for the Pacific Fur Company, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near Lewiston today."
5275,11,idaho,5275," This position, called ""MacKenzie's Post"" or ""Clearwater"", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was acquired by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned."
5276,11,idaho,5276,The first attempts by organized communities within the present borders of Idaho were launched in 1860.
5277,11,idaho,5277,The first community incorporated as a permanent and important corporation was Lewiston in 1861.
5278,11,idaho,5278," After a few tribulations as a territory, including the chaotic transfer from the territorial capital of Lewiston to Boise, the abandonment of the right to vote of the Mormonist polygamists supported by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, and a federal attempt to divide the territory between the territory of Washington which obtained state status in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho obtained state status in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,Idaho was one of the hardest hit by Pacific Northwest States during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280," Prices fell for Idaho's main crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes earned only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho's farmers saw their annual income fall from $686 in 1929 to $250 in 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its business base as a state of tourism and agriculture to include the science and technology industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest economic centre in the state (over 25 per cent of total government revenues) and are more important than agriculture, forestry and mining combined."
5283,11,idaho,5283,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of Idaho was 1,787,065 on July 1, 2018, an increase of 14% since 2010."
5284,11,idaho,5284,"Idaho had an estimated population of 1,754,208 in 2018, an increase of 37,265 over the previous year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010."
5285,11,idaho,5285," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to the net migration of 75,795 people to the state."
5286,11,idaho,5286, There are a large number of English and German Americans in Idaho.
5287,11,idaho,5287,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and internal migration resulted in a net increase of 61,273 people."
5288,11,idaho,5288,"Idaho is the tenth fastest growing state after the District of Columbia (+16.74%), Utah (+14.37%), Texas (+14.14%), Florida (+13.29%), Colorado (+13.25%), North Dakota (+13.01 %), Nevada (+12.36%), Arizona (+12.20%) and Washington."
5289,11,idaho,5289," From 2017 to 2018, the Idaho is the second fastest, surpassed only by Nevada."
5290,11,idaho,5290,"Nampa, approximately 30 km west of downtown Boise, became the second largest city in the state in the late 1990s, passing through Pocatello and Idaho Falls."
5291,11,idaho,5291,"The population of Nampa was less than 29,000 in 1990 and increased to over 81,000 in 2010."
5292,11,idaho,5292," Located between Nampa and Boise, Meridian also experienced strong growth, from less than 10,000 inhabitants in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now the third largest city in Idaho."
5293,11,idaho,5293," Growth of 5% or more was also observed during the same period for Caldwell, Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls and Twin Falls."
5294,11,idaho,5294," From 1990 to 2010, the Idaho population increased by more than 560,000 (55%)."
5295,11,idaho,5295,"The metropolitan area of Boise (officially known as Boise City-Nampa, ID Metropolitan Statistical Region) is the largest metropolitan area in Idaho."
5296,11,idaho,5296," Other metropolitan areas in order of size are Heart of Alene, Idaho Falls, Pocatello and Lewiston."
5297,11,idaho,5297,The following table shows the racial composition of the Idaho population in 2016.
5298,11,idaho,5298," According to the 2017 U.S. Community Survey, 12.2% of the population of Idaho were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (10.6%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.1%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (1.3%)."
5299,11,idaho,5299,"The five largest ancestry groups were German (17.5 per cent), English (16.4 per cent), Irish (9.3 per cent), American (8.1 per cent) and Scots (3.2 per cent)."
5300,11,idaho,5300,"Note: The births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."
5301,11,idaho,5301," According to the Pew Research Center on Religion & Public Life, the self-identified religious affiliations of Idahoans over 18 years of age in 2008 and 2014 were:"
5302,11,idaho,5302," According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest denominations by number of members in 2010 were the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Days Saints with 409 265; the Catholic Church with 123 400; the Evangelical Protestant with 62 637; and the Assemblies of God with 22,183."
5303,11,idaho,5303,English is the predominant language of the state.
5304,11,idaho,5304,The minority languages include Spanish and various Amerindian languages.
5305,11,idaho,5305,"The 2015 gross national product was $64.9 billion, and the per capita income based on 2015 GDP and 2015 population estimates was $39,100."
5306,11,idaho,5306,Idaho is an important agricultural state that produces almost a third of the potatoes grown in the United States.
5307,11,idaho,5307,"The three varieties of wheat, dark northern spring, hard red, and soft white are grown in the state."
5308,11,idaho,5308,The County of Nez Perce is considered to be the first soft-white growing region.
5309,11,idaho,5309,"Idaho's major industries are food processing, lumber and wood products, machinery, chemicals, paper products, electronic manufacturing, silver and other extractive industries, and tourism."
5310,11,idaho,5310,"The largest cheese factory in the world, the raw product for processed cheese is in Gooding, Idaho."
5311,11,idaho,5311,"It has a capacity of 120,000 metric tonnes per year of cheese in barrels and belongs to the Glanbia group."
5312,11,idaho,5312,The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is the largest installation in the country's Energy Department by region.
5313,11,idaho,5313,INL is an important part of the Eastern Idaho economy.
5314,11,idaho,5314,The Idaho also houses three facilities in Anheuser-Busch that provide a large part of malt for breweries across the country.
5315,11,idaho,5315,A variety of industries is important.
5316,11,idaho,5316," Outdoor recreation is a common example, ranging from many snowmobile, downhill and cross-country ski resorts in winter to Lewiston's evolution as a retreat community based on mild winters, a dry and year-round climate and one of the lowest midwind speeds everywhere, combined with rivers for a wide variety of activities."
5317,11,idaho,5317," Other examples would be ATK Corporation, which operates three munitions and ammunition components plants in Lewiston."
5318,11,idaho,5318, Two are sportsmen and one is a defence contract.
5319,11,idaho,5319,"The Lewis-Clark Valley has another independent ammunition component manufacturer and the Chipmunk rifle plant until it was purchased in 2007 by Keystone Sporting Arms and the production was transferred to Milton, Pennsylvania."
5320,11,idaho,5320,"Four of the six world-wide manufacturers of welded aluminium reaction vessels (for fluvial rapids) are located in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley, WA."
5321,11,idaho,5321, Wine grapes were cultivated between Kendrick and Juliaetta in Idaho Panhandle by the French Rothschild until the ban.
5322,11,idaho,5322," Similarly, although there are no large cellars or breweries in Idaho, there are a large number of award-winning cellars and microbreweries in the northern part of the state."
5323,11,idaho,5323, Today Idaho's largest industry is the science and technology sector.
5324,11,idaho,5324,It accounts for more than 25 per cent of government revenues and over 70 per cent of government exports.
5325,11,idaho,5325,"The industrial economy of Idaho is growing, with high-tech products at the forefront."
5326,11,idaho,5326," Since the late 1970s, Boise has become a centre for the production of semiconductors."
5327,11,idaho,5327,"Boise is the home of Micron Technology, the only American manufacturer of random access dynamic chips (DRAM)."
5328,11,idaho,5328,"Micron at one time manufactured desktop computers, but with very limited success."
5329,11,idaho,5329,"Hewlett-Packard has operated a large plant in Boise since the 1970s, primarily dedicated to the production of LaserJet printers."

5334,11,idaho,5334,Sun earns $4 million in annual salaries and over $300 million in revenue to the Crown each year.
5335,11,idaho,5335,"A number of Fortune 500 companies have begun to establish or trace their roots in Idaho, including Safeway in American Falls, Alberts in Boise, JR Simplot in southern Idaho and Potlatch Corp. in Lewiston."
5336,11,idaho,5336,"Zimmerly Air Transport to Lewiston-Clarkston was one of five companies of the merger centered around Varney Air Lines from Pasco, Washington, which became United Airlines and then Varney Air Group which became Continental Airlines."
5337,11,idaho,5337,"In 2014, Idaho became the second most favourable state for small businesses, ranking behind Utah, based on a study based on data from over 12,000 small business owners."
5338,11,idaho,5338,Idaho owns a state gambling lottery that contributed $333.5 million to all public schools and higher education in Idaho from 1990 to 2006.
5339,11,idaho,5339,The tax is collected by the Idaho State Tax Commission.
5340,11,idaho,5340,The government's personal income tax varies from 1.6 per cent to 7.8 per cent in eight income brackets.
5341,11,idaho,5341,"The Idahoans may claim State tax credits for taxes paid to other States, as well as for donations to educational entities in the State of Idaho and to certain non-profit educational and rehabilitation institutions for young people."
5342,11,idaho,5342,The state sales tax is 6% with a very limited and selective local option up to 6.5%.
5343,11,idaho,5343," Sales tax applies to the sale, lease or rental of tangible personal property and certain services."
5344,11,idaho,5344,"Food is taxed, but prescription drugs are not."
5345,11,idaho,5345,"Hotels, motels and campgrounds are taxed at a higher rate (7 to 11 per cent)."
5346,11,idaho,5346, Some jurisdictions impose sales tax on local options.
5347,11,idaho,5347,"The sales tax was introduced at 3% in 1965, easily approved by voters, where it remained at 3% until 1983."
5348,11,idaho,5348,"In 2017, Idaho's primary energy source was hydro power, and energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatt hours (MWh)."
5349,11,idaho,5349,"In 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market with the Idaho Public Services Commission regulating the three main utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,The energy landscape of Idaho supports the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,"The State is rich in renewable energy resources, but its fossil fuel resources are limited."
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller river basins provide Idaho with some of the country's best hydroelectric resources and geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind energy potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353, These realities have shaped a large part of the state's energy landscape.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports the bulk of the energy it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355," Imports account for over 80% of energy consumption, including the total supply of natural gas and oil to Idaho and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"In 2005, 48% of the electricity consumed in Idaho came from hydro, 42% from coal combustion and 9% from natural gas combustion."
5357,11,idaho,5357,"The rest comes from other renewable sources, such as wind."
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The State's numerous river basins allow hydropower plants to supply 556,000 MWh, representing about three quarters of the electricity generated by Idaho in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,The state of Washington supplies most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two major pipeline networks that supply the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360," Although the State relies on sources outside the State for its total supply of natural gas, it uses natural gas-fired facilities to produce 127 000 MWh, or about 10 per cent of its production."
5361,11,idaho,5361, Coal production and the small grid of state wind turbines feed the rest of the state's electricity production.
5362,11,idaho,5362,The state produces 739 000 MWh but still has to import half of its electricity from outside the state to meet the demand.
5363,11,idaho,5363," While Idaho's 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) are small compared to other states and account for only 0.5% of U.S. consumption, the state also has the country's 11th smallest population, 1.5 million people, so that its energy consumption per capita of BTU 352 million (103 MWh) is just above the national average of BTU 333 million (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th state in terms of area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), the distance creates the additional problem of ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365," When the length of an electric transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electrical current passing through it is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States and the population is expected to increase by 31% between 2008 and 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367," This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, which will further increase Idaho's limited hydropower resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has a higher estimate of the development potential to generate 44,320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind energy and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar energy using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of photovoltaics on roofs, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar energy."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Ministry of Transportation is the government agency responsible for Idaho's transportation infrastructure, including operation and maintenance and planning for future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The Agency is also responsible for overseeing the delivery of federal, state and government transportation program grants."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is one of the few states in the nation without a major highway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"US-95 connects the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it is in dire need of repair and improvement."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Department of Transport reported that the Government's road infrastructure was facing an annual deficit of $200 million in maintenance and improvement."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main road connecting the south-east and south-west parts of the State, with I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Major Federal Aid Roads in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"Major airports include the Boise International Airport serving the southwestern Idaho and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) serving northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377, Other scheduled airports include Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving Palouse; Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and the north and west centre of Idaho; Magic Valley Regional Airport at Twin Falls; Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and Pocatello Regional Airport.
5378,11,idaho,5378,Idaho is served by three transcontinental railways.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland and Spokane to the west, and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"BNSF crosses the counties of Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary."
5381,11,idaho,5381,"The Union Pacific Railway crosses the Northern Idaho by entering Canada via Boundary and Bonner, and by way of Spokane."
5382,11,idaho,5382,"Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in North Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon."
5383,11,idaho,5383,"Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses the north of Idaho, with its only stop at Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384," Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho."
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific railway also crosses southern Idaho between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,Lewiston Harbour is the furthest inland harbour in the Pacific on the west coast.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and Columbia River facilitate the movement of barges from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded onto ocean vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,The constitution of Idaho is roughly modelled on the national constitution with several additions.
5389,11,idaho,5389,The Constitution defines the form and functions of the state government and may be amended by plebiscite.
5390,11,idaho,5390,"In particular, the constitution of the State currently requires that the Government of the State maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391,"As a result, the Idaho has a limited debt (construction bonds, etc.)."
5392,11,idaho,5392,",............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"
5393,11,idaho,5393,All the laws of Idaho are contained in the Idaho Code and Statute.
5394,11,idaho,5394,The Code is amended by the legislature with the approval of the Governor.
5395,11,idaho,5395,Idaho still operates under its original constitution (1889).
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The Idaho Constitution provides for three powers of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"The Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected in 35 legislative districts, each represented by a senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398," Since 1946, State-wide constitutional officers have been elected for a four-year term."
5399,11,idaho,5399," These include the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, the Idaho Comptroller of State (prior to 1994), the Treasurer, the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Instruction."
5400,11,idaho,5400," Recently contested in 1966, the Inspector of Mines was a constitutional office originally elected."
5401,11,idaho,5401," After that, it was a position appointed and finally completely abolished in 1974."
5402,11,idaho,5402,The government of Idaho has a monopoly on alcohol.
5403,11,idaho,5403,The governor of Idaho has a four-year term and is elected in mid-term elections at the national level.
5404,11,idaho,5404,"As such, the Governor is not elected during the same election year as the President of the United States."
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current Governor is Republican Brad Little, who was elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,Idaho's legislature is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407," However, the session may be extended if necessary, and it is often extended."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"For this reason, the legislators of Idaho are considered ""citizen legislators"", which means that their position as legislator is not their main occupation."
5409,11,idaho,5409,The terms of office of the senator and the House of Representatives are two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410,The parliamentary elections are held every single year.
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The Idaho Legislature has been permanently controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although democratic legislators are systematically elected in Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and North Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,Idaho's highest court is the Supreme Court of Idaho.
5413,11,idaho,5413," There is also an interim court of appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeal, which hears cases referred to it by the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The state district courts serve seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,Idaho is divided into political courts designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416," Since 1919, the state has had 44 counties, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 km2)."
5417,11,idaho,5417, Three counties were first designated as such by the Land Assembly of Washington in 1861.
5418,11,idaho,5418,"Nez Percé County of 1861 has since been divided into counties of Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai and Clearwater."
5419,11,idaho,5419,The Idaho licence plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county name.
5420,11,idaho,5420," When a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number must be accompanied in alphabetical order."
5421,11,idaho,5421," This reflects an abnormal situation that coincides with the fact that 10 counties start with B, 7 with C and 4 with L, or 21 of the 44 counties."
5422,11,idaho,5422," After the civil war, many democrats from the Midwest and South settled in the territory of Idaho."
5423,11,idaho,5423,"As a result, the first territorial legislatures were firmly controlled by the democrats."
5424,11,idaho,5424,"On the other hand, most territorial governors were appointed by Republican Presidents and were Republicans."
5425,11,idaho,5425," This has led to sometimes bitter clashes between the two parties, including a war of scope with the democrats supporting the shepherds and the Republicans the breeders, which ended in the trial for murder ""Diamondfield"" Jack Davis."
5426,11,idaho,5426,In the 1880s Republicans became more important in local politics.
5427,11,idaho,5427,In 1864 Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and statehood from a locked safe and took them to Boise.
5428,11,idaho,5428," This did indeed move the capital from where it was stored (Lewiston, Idaho) to the current capital Boise."
5429,11,idaho,5429," Since the establishment of the state, the Republican Party has generally been the dominant party of Idaho."
5430,11,idaho,5430,"At one point, Idaho had two democratic parties, one being the general public and the other called the anti-Marmon Democrats, which lasted until the beginning of the 20th century."
5431,11,idaho,5431,"In the 1890s and early 1900s, the populist party enjoyed importance while the Democratic Party retained a brief domination in the 1930s during the Great Depression."
5432,11,idaho,5432," Since the Second World War, most of the state-wide elected representatives are Republicans, although the Democrats were the majority in the House (by a seat) in 1958 and in the post of Governor from 1971 to 1995."
5433,11,idaho,5433,The delegations of the Idaho Congress have also been generally republican since the establishment of the State.
5434,11,idaho,5434," Several Idaho Democrats have had an electoral success in the House over the years, but the Senators' delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades."

6339,13,indiana,6339,Indiana has had great sporting success at the college level.

6347,13,indiana,6347,Total gross domestic product in 2016 was $347.2 billion.
6348,13,indiana,6348,A high percentage of Indiana's income comes from the manufacturing industry.
6349,13,indiana,6349," According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 17 per cent of the government's non-agricultural labour force is employed in manufacturing, the highest of all states in the United States."
6350,13,indiana,6350,"The Government's top five exports were motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, optical and medical equipment and electrical machinery."
6351,13,indiana,6351," Despite its dependence on manufacturing, Indiana was less affected by the decline in traditional Rust Belt manufacturing than many of its neighbours."
6352,13,indiana,6352,The explanation seems to be some factors in the labour market.
6353,13,indiana,6353,"First, a large part of heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires a highly skilled workforce, and firms are often willing to find where there are already skills that are difficult to train."
6354,13,indiana,6354,"Second, Indiana's labour force is found primarily in medium and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises."
6355,13,indiana,6355, This allows companies to offer slightly lower wages for these skills than they would normally be.
6356,13,indiana,6356, Companies often see Indiana as a chance to achieve above-average skills at below-average wages.
6357,13,indiana,6357,"In 2016, Indiana hosted seven Fortune 500 companies with combined sales of $142.5 billion."

6373,13,indiana,6373,"In some jurisdictions, an additional food and beverage tax is imposed at a rate of 1% (the Marion County rate is 2%), on sales of prepared meals and beverages."
6374,13,indiana,6374,Property taxes are levied on Indiana's real and personal property and are administered by the Ministry of Finance of Local Government.
6375,13,indiana,6375,"The property is subject to taxation by various taxing units (schools, counties, townships, municipalities and libraries), making the total tax rate the sum of tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which a property is located."
6376,13,indiana,6376," However, a ""breakwater"" law passed on March 19, 2008, limits property tax to 1% of the assessed value for owners, 2% for rental properties and agricultural land, and 3% for businesses."
6377,13,indiana,6377,Indiana does not have a legal obligation to balance the state budget either in the law or in its constitution.

6384,13,indiana,6384,"Indiana also houses the coal-fired power plant with the highest sulphur dioxide emissions in the United States, the Gallagher power plant, just west of New Albany."
6385,13,indiana,6385,"In 2010, Indiana had estimated coal reserves at 57 billion tons, and State mining activities produced 35 million tons of coal per year."
6386,13,indiana,6386,"Indiana also has at least 900 million barrels of oil reserves in the Trenton field, although they are not easily recoverable."
6387,13,indiana,6387," While Indiana has committed to increasing the use of renewable resources such as wind, hydro, biomass or solar energy, progress has been very slow, mainly due to the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana."
6388,13,indiana,6388, Most of the new state facilities were coal gasification plants.
6389,13,indiana,6389, Another source is hydroelectric power.
6390,13,indiana,6390,Wind power has been developed.
6391,13,indiana,6391,"The 2006 estimates increased Indiana's wind capacity from 30 MW to 50 m in height to 40,000 MW in height to 70 m and to 130,000 MW in height to 100 m in 2010."

6396,13,indiana,6396,A long-standing proposal to transform Gary Chicago International Airport into the third major Chicago airport received a boost in early 2006 with the approval of $48 million in federal funding over the next ten years.
6397,13,indiana,6397," There are no airlines operating from the Terre Haute regional airport, but it is used for private aircraft."
6398,13,indiana,6398," Since 1954, 181 Wing of the Indian National Air Guard has been stationed there, but the 2005 Realignment and Closure Base (BRAC) proposal indicated that the 181st would lose its fighter mission and F-16 aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility with a combat aircraft facility."

6403,13,indiana,6403, There are also many American roads and state highways maintained by Indiana's Department of Transportation.
6404,13,indiana,6404, They are numbered according to the same convention as the United States.
6405,13,indiana,6405, Highways.
6406,13,indiana,6406,Indiana allows highways of various classifications to have the same number.
6407,13,indiana,6407,"For example, I-64 and Indiana State Road 64 both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are separate roads with no relation to each other."

6411,13,indiana,6411," Once completed, the I-69 will cross an additional 142 miles (229 km) across the state."
6412,13,indiana,6412," Most Indiana counties use a network-based system to identify county roads; this system has replaced the old arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) it is much easier to identify call sources placed in the 9-1-1 system."
6413,13,indiana,6413, These systems are easier to implement in the glacially flat northern and central parts of the State.
6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on non-systematic road names (e.g., Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott and Washington counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415, There are also counties in the northern parts of the State that have never set up a grid or implemented only part of it.
6416,13,indiana,6416," Some counties are also distributed in a network that is almost similar to that of diamonds (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson and Knox counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417, Such a system is also almost useless in these situations as well.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"One day, Knox County used two different network systems for county roads because the county was built using two different surveying systems, but it has since decided to use road names and to combine roads instead."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"In particular, the road network of St. Joseph County, whose main city is South Bend, uses names of perennial trees (i.e., from the south to the west)."
6420,13,indiana,6420,"Ash, Hickory, Iron wood, etc.)"
6421,13,indiana,6421,"In alphabetical order for north-south roads and presidential names and other notable names (i.e. Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.)"

6562,14,iowa,6562,Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs.

7725,16,kentucky,7725, This policy was successfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in Berea College v. Kentucky in 1908.
7726,16,kentucky,7726, That decision effectively separated Berea until Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.

7736,16,kentucky,7736, Kentucky is more similar to Upland South in terms of ancestry that is primarily American.
7737,16,kentucky,7737," Nevertheless, in the 19th century, Kentucky received a large number of German immigrants, who settled mainly in the Midwest, along Ohio, mainly in Louisville, Covington, and Newport."
7738,16,kentucky,7738," Only Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia have higher percentages of German ancestry than Kentucky among the Southern states defined by the census, although the percentage of Kentucky is closer to Arkansas and Virginia than that of the previously designated state."

7743,16,kentucky,7743, Kentucky adopted the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in most public areas after the civil war.
7744,16,kentucky,7744,Louisville's 1914 Order on Residential Racial Segregation was invalidated by the United States Supreme Court in 1917.
7745,16,kentucky,7745," However, in 1908, Kentucky enacted the law of the day, ""An Act to Prohibit White and Colourful Persons from Attending the Same School"", which Berea College unsuccessfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in 1908; in 1948, Lyman T. Johnson brought an action for admission to Kentucky University; as a result, in the summer of 1949, nearly thirty African-American students entered graduate and vocational programs in the United Kingdom."
7746,16,kentucky,7746," Kentucky joined his schools after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education verdict, later passing the first State Civil Rights Act in the South in 1966."

7899,17,louisiana,7899,"In 1721, they built a 19-metre wooden lighthouse to guide the ships on the river."
7900,17,louisiana,7900,A Royal Order of 1722 – following the Crown's transfer of the governance of the Illinois country from Canada to Louisiana – may have provided the broadest definition of Louisiana: all lands claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies.
7901,17,louisiana,7901,"A generation later, trade disputes between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745 the Governor General of Louisiana, Vaudreuil, fixed the northern and eastern boundaries of his estate, such as the Wabash Valley, to the mouth of the Vermilion River (nearly today Danville, Illinois); thence from the northwest to the Rock on the Illinois River, and thence west to the mouth of the Rock River (now Rock Island, Illinois)."
7902,17,louisiana,7902,"For example, Vincennes and Peoria were the limits of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (in the upper Wabash near Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (nearly today Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada."

7905,17,louisiana,7905,"The colony soon became a flourishing river port and a crossroads, giving birth to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were exploited by imported African slaves."
7906,17,louisiana,7906,"Over time, the planters have developed large plantations and built beautiful houses in a growing city."
7907,17,louisiana,7907," This has become a repeated model in New Orleans and other places, although the cultivation of commodities in the south was mainly sugar cane."
7908,17,louisiana,7908,"The French colonies of Louisiana contributed to exploration and outposts, concentrated along the shores of Mississippi and its main tributaries, from Louisiana to the north of the area known as Illinois, around St. Louis, now Missouri."
7909,17,louisiana,7909,The latter was established by French settlers in Illinois.
7910,17,louisiana,7910,"At first, Mobile then Biloxi served as the capital of La Louisiana."
7911,17,louisiana,7911," Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River for trade and military interests, and seeking to protect the capital against severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civil and military authority in the south of the Great Lakes."
7912,17,louisiana,7912," From then on, until the United States acquired territory in Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and lands west of Mississippi."
7913,17,louisiana,7913,"In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River in an area called the German coast."
7914,17,louisiana,7914,"France gave up most of its territory east of Mississippi in Britain in 1763, following Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War (generally called the French and Indian War in North America)."
7915,17,louisiana,7915,"The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, had become a colony of Spain under the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)."
7916,17,louisiana,7916,The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.
7917,17,louisiana,7917,"In 1765, during Spanish domination, several thousand Francophone refugees from the Acadia region (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada) visited Louisiana after being expelled from their homeland by the British during the French and Indian War."
7918,17,louisiana,7918," They settled mainly in the southwest region of Louisiana, now known as Acadiana."
7919,17,louisiana,7919," Governor Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, who wanted to win more settlers, welcomed the Acadian refugees, the ancestors of the Cajuns of Louisiana."
7920,17,louisiana,7920,"The Spanish Canary Islands, known as Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783."
7921,17,louisiana,7921,"In 1800, the Frenchman Napoleon Bonaparte took over Louisiana from Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years."
7922,17,louisiana,7922,"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies."
7923,17,louisiana,7923,"In 1709 French financier Antoine Crozat obtained a trade monopoly in La Louisiana, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois."
7924,17,louisiana,7924,"""This concession allowed him to bring a cargo of African blacks every year,"" writes British historian Hugh Thomas."
7925,17,louisiana,7925," Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh that there was high mortality among both settlers and slaves, resulting in continued demand for and import of slaves."
7926,17,louisiana,7926," Starting in 1719, traders began to import more slaves; two French ships, Du Maine and Aurore, arrived in New Orleans and carried more than 500 black slaves from Africa."
7927,17,louisiana,7927,The former slaves in Louisiana had been transported from the French colonies in the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721 New Orleans had 1,256 inhabitants, approximately half of whom were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724 the French government published a law called Code Noir (""Code Noir"" in English) which ""regulates the interaction of white [white] and black [black] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much greater than the present state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law included 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, prohibited ""interracial"" marriages (those between persons of different skin colour, whose varying nuances were also defined by law), restricted manipulation, described the legal penalties imposed on slaves for various offences and defined certain obligations of owners towards their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main intention of the French government was to assert control over the system of slavery of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on the owners of slaves there.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Black Code was extremely difficult to implement by far."
7933,17,louisiana,7933," Some priests continued to perform interracial wedding ceremonies, for example, and some slave owners continued to handle slaves without permission, while others brutally punished slaves."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Black Code of 1724 obliges owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the State religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935, Sunday was to be a day of rest for the slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On days off, it was expected that the slaves would feed themselves and take care of themselves."
7937,17,louisiana,7937," During the economic crisis of the 1740s in the colony, the owners struggled to feed their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938," Giving them free time also gave more power to the slaves, who began to cultivate their own gardens and to make objects for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939," They began to participate in the economic development of the colony, while increasing independence and self-subsistence."
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Black Code prohibits mixed marriages, prohibits mixed marriages, but hardly protects women slaves from the rape of their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941," Overall, the Code benefits the owners but has more protections and flexibility than the establishment of slavery in the 13 southern colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 makes cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers are rarely prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"Fugitive slaves, called marons, could easily hide in the hinterland of bayous people and survive in small colonies."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maron"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", that is, ""fugitive bovine""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"At the end of the 18th century, the last Spanish governor of Louisiana territory wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946," When the United States bought Louisiana in 1803, it was quickly accepted that African slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighbouring Mississippi, although it violated American law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947," Despite the demands of Rep. James Hillhouse of the United States and the brochure Thomas Paine to enforce the federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the cheapest labour."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small sugar producer with a relatively small number of slaves compared to Santo Domingo and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949," Shortly thereafter, he became an important sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations."
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, the first American governor of Louisiana, said that the work of African slaves was necessary because white workers ""can't have in this unhealthy climate."""
7951,17,louisiana,7951," Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to implement the abolition of the slave trade in Africa, which the United States and Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including coastal trade, shipping slaves along the Atlantic coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"In 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the United States, making a significant contribution to the economy of the city and the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,New Orleans had become one of the richest cities and the nation's third largest city.
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and the importation of slaves has increased demand in the domestic market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"Over the decades since the American Revolutionary War, more than a million enslaved Africans have been forced to migrate from the Upper South to the deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957, Others were transported by their owners as slave owners moved westward to find new lands.
7958,17,louisiana,7958," With the shift in agriculture in the Upper South as planters moved from tobacco to low-labour-intensive mixed farming, planters had surplus workers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959, Many sold slaves to traders to take them to the deep south.
7960,17,louisiana,7960,The slaves were driven by Upper South traders or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by boat as part of the slave trade on the coast.
7961,17,louisiana,7961," After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations in Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,The Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted between 1769 and 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963," From the 1790s onwards, waves of immigration took place in Santo Domingo, following a slave rebellion that began in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana on the island, including ethnic Europeans, people free of colour, and African slaves, some of whom were brought by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965," They have greatly increased the Francophone population of New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and slaves have strengthened African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The process of independence in Santo Domingo was complex, but the uprisings were continuing."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803, France withdrew its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two thirds sent to the island two years earlier, mainly with yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic of the western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, carried out by slave leaders."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) said: ""Saint-Domingue is, of all our colonies in the West Indies, the one whose mentality and customs have most influenced Louisiana."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970," When the United States gained independence from Britain in 1783, one of its main concerns was to have a European power at its western border, and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As the American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachians constituted an obstacle to the shipment of goods to the east."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship the products was to use a flat boat to float it in Ohio and Mississippi to the port of New Orleans, where the goods could be placed on oceanic ships."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this route was that the Spaniards had both sides of Mississippi under Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974, Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana implied the creation of a new empire centered on the Caribbean sugar trade.
7975,17,louisiana,7975," Under the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain restored to the French ownership of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe."
7976,17,louisiana,7976," Napoleon saw Louisiana as a deposit for these sugar islands, and as a buffer for the American establishment."
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a great military force to take over Santo Domingo, then under the control of Toussaint Louverture after a rebellion of slaves.When the army led by Napoleon Leclerc's brother-in-law was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plan to re-establish the French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979," With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close Mississippi to the American trade at any time."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, American minister in France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, parts of the east shore of Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for American trade."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer from Louisiana to the French property had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's agreement with the Spaniards was a poorly guarded secret on the border."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, the acting intendant of Louisiana, made public Spain's intention to revoke the right of deposit in New Orleans for any cargo from the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port in the United States has caused anger and dismay.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,Trade in the West has been practically blocked.
7986,17,louisiana,7986," Historians believe that the revocation of the deposit was caused by the abuses committed by the Americans, in particular by smuggling, and not by the French intrigues, as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987," President Jefferson ignored public pressure for the war with France, and appointed James Monroe as Special Envoy to Napoleon, to help secure New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson also increased the authorized expenditures to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989," However, on April 11, 1803 French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how willing the United States was to pay for the whole of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered it)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon could withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them without the possibility of obtaining the desired region of New Orleans), and that President Jefferson's approval could take months, so that Livingston and Monroe decided to open the negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"As of April 30, they entered into a transaction for the purchase of the entire territory of Louisiana of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for sixty million francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,Part of this $3.5 million was used to repay France's debts to the United States.
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in US bonds, which Napoleon sold in nominal value to the Dutch company Hope and Company, and to the British bank house in Baring, at a discount of 87 1⁄2 per unit of $100."
7994,17,louisiana,7994," Consequently, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"The English banker Alexander Baring confided Marbois in Paris, fled to the United States to recover the bonds, took them to Great Britain and returned to France with the money Napoleon was waging war against his own country."
7996,17,louisiana,7996," When the news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,He had authorized an expenditure of $10 million for a port city and received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a set of land that would double the size of the country.
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents to the Federalist Party argued that the purchase in Louisiana was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new lands or the negotiation of treaties without the consent of the senator."
7999,17,louisiana,7999," What really worries the opposition is the new states that will inevitably be cut off from Louisiana territory, reinforcing Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England's federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000," President Jefferson was a strong supporter of western expansion, and he strongly supported the treaty."
8001,17,louisiana,8001," Despite federalist objections, the American Senators ratified the Treaty of Louisiana on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002,"By law promulgated on 31 October 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories transferred by France and to ensure the initial governance."
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony took place in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004," Since the territory of Louisiana had never been officially handed over to the French, the Spaniards removed their flag, and the French raised their flag."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,"The next day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States."
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony took place in Saint-Louis on 9 March 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The next day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the first United States of America"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,The artillery marched its troops in the city and made the American flag raise the mast of the fort.
8009,17,louisiana,8009," Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the U.S. government, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010," Louisiana's territory, purchased for less than three hundred per acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without war or loss of a single American life, and created a precedent for the purchase of territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It paved the way for a possible expansion of the United States across the continent towards the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012," Shortly after the seizure of possession of the United States, the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on March 26, 1804, thus organizing the territory of Orleans to the south and the district of Louisiana (later formed as the territory of Louisiana) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013, Louisiana became the eighteenth American state on 30 April 1812; the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana and the territory of Louisiana simultaneously became the territory of Missouri.
8014,17,louisiana,8014,A region known as Florida Parishes was soon annexed to Louisiana on 14 April 1812.
8015,17,louisiana,8015," From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a two-party system, with the Democrats competing first with the Whigs, then with the Know Nothings, and finally with other Democrats."
8016,17,louisiana,8016," According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, or nearly 47 per cent of the total population of the State, or 708,002 people."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,The strong economic interest of the elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to separate from the Union on 26 January 1861.
8018,17,louisiana,8018,He followed other southern states in secession after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019,"The secession of Louisiana was announced on January 26, 1861 and became an integral part of the Confederate States of America."
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated during the civil war, the result of the Union's strategy to cut Confederation in half by taking over Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,"Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862."
8022,17,louisiana,8022," Because a large part of the population had sympathy from the Union (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives in the American Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023," After the civil war and the emancipation of slaves, violence intensified in the South as war was waged by private and paramilitary rebel groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024," Initially, state legislatures were dominated by former confederates, who adopted black codes to regulate free men and generally refused to vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025, They refused to extend the right to vote to African-Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).
8026,17,louisiana,8026," Following the Memphis riots in 1866 and the riot in New Orleans that same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted which provided the vote and full citizenship for the released men."
8027,17,louisiana,8027," Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, creating military districts for states where conditions were considered to be the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,It was clustered with Texas in what was administered as the fifth military district.
8029,17,louisiana,8029, African Americans have begun to live as citizens with some equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030," Released men and people of colour who had been free before the war began to make more progress in education, family stability and employment."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was huge social volatility in the aftermath of the war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labour market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in the chapters of Ku Klux Klan."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"In 1877, when the federal forces were withdrawn, the white democrats of Louisiana and other states regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which eliminated the black vote through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034," According to the example of Mississippi in 1890, in 1898, the white, democratic, planter-dominated legislature adopted a new constitution that effectively deprived people of colour of their rights, raising obstacles to voter registration, such as voting taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect has been immediate and lasting.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the lists of electors and approximately the same number of white voters, in proportion to the population of the State, which was also divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"In 1900, the population of the State was 47% African-American, a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038," Many in New Orleans were descendants of coloured Creoles, the large population of colour free people before the civil war."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"In 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the State."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"In 1910, there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5% of eligible African American men), despite the progress of education and literacy among blacks and people of colour."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve in juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"The White Democrats established a one-party democratic regime, which they maintained in the state for decades deep in the 20th century until, after the adoption by Congress of the 1965 law on voting rights, federal control and the application of the constitutional right to vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African-Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow's society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,The infestation of the plough and agricultural problems have cost many farmers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,Mechanization of agriculture has also reduced the need for workers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046," Beginning in the 1940s, Blacks went to California for jobs in its expanding defence industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047," During part of the Great Depression, Louisiana was ruled by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected on a populist appeal.
8049,17,louisiana,8049," His public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased the vote for the poor whites, but Long was criticized for his supposedly democratic and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He has extended the control of favouritism to all branches of the Louisiana government.
8051,17,louisiana,8051, His plans for redistribution of wealth in the state were particularly controversial.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule came to an abrupt end when he was murdered in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,Mobilizing for the Second World War created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,But thousands of other black and white workers have emigrated to California for better jobs in its nascent defence industry.
8055,17,louisiana,8055," Many African-Americans left the state during the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s to the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had significantly reduced the need for workers.
8057,17,louisiana,8057," They were looking for qualified jobs in the defence industry in California, better education for their children and living in communities where they could vote."
8058,17,louisiana,8058,"On 26 November 1958, at Chennault Air Base, a USAF B-47 bomber with a nuclear weapon on board fired on the ground."
8059,17,louisiana,8059,The wreckage of the aircraft and the site of the accident were contaminated after a limited explosion of non-nuclear material.
8060,17,louisiana,8060,"In the 1950s, the State created new conditions for a citizenship test for voter registration."
8061,17,louisiana,8061," Despite opposition from the State Rights Party, low-state black voters have begun to increase their enrolment rates, which also reflects the growth of their middle classes."
8062,17,louisiana,8062,"In 1960, the state established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation."
8063,17,louisiana,8063," Despite this, the registration and participation rate of black voters has gradually increased to 20 per cent or more, and it was 32 per cent in 1964, when the first national legislation on civil rights at the time was adopted."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"The percentage of black voters varied considerably over the years, from 93.8% in the evangelical parish to 1.7% in the parish of Tensas, for example, where there were white efforts to suppress the vote in the parish with a black majority."
8065,17,louisiana,8065,"Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill cities were the catalyst for the creation of the first two chapters of the Deacons of Defence and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, respectively, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa."
8066,17,louisiana,8066,"Composed of veterans of the Second World War and the Korean War, they were armed self-defence groups established to protect activists and their families."

8072,17,louisiana,8072," Due to better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, Blacks continued to emigrate outside Louisiana for a net loss of more than 37,000 people."
8073,17,louisiana,8073," According to official census figures, the African-American population in 1970 was 1,085,109 persons, a net gain of more than 46,000 people compared to 1960."
8074,17,louisiana,8074," During this last period, some people began to migrate to New South cities to find opportunities."

8076,17,louisiana,8076,"On 21 May 1919, the nineteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, giving women the full right to vote, was adopted at the national level, and was enacted throughout the United States on 18 August 1920."
8077,17,louisiana,8077," Louisiana finally ratified the amendment on June 11, 1970."
8078,17,louisiana,8078," Because of its location on the Gulf coast, Louisiana has suffered regularly from the effects of tropical storms and harmful hurricanes."
8079,17,louisiana,8079,"On August 29, 2005, New Orleans and many other lower parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were affected by the catastrophic hurricane Katrina."
8080,17,louisiana,8080,It caused considerable damage due to the breakage of dykes and the large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city.
8081,17,louisiana,8081," Officials have issued warnings to evacuate the city and surrounding areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, have remained behind, many of whom have remained blocked."

8095,17,louisiana,8095, Louisiana is bordered west by Texas
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The condition can be properly divided into two parts, the northern highlands, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial region includes low marshlands, coastal marshes and beaches, and barrier islands that cover approximately 20,000 square miles (52,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098," This region is mainly along the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi, which crosses the state from north to south for a distance of about 600 mi (970 km) and flows into the Gulf of Mexico; the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The width of the alluvial region along Mississippi is 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100 km), and along the other rivers the alluvial region has an average of about 10 miles (15 km) across."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as the dike), from which the land decreases to a river beyond an average fall of six feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,Alluvial lands along other watercourses have similar characteristics.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The upper and contiguous hills of the north and north-western parts of the state have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103, They are made up of meadows and forests.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,Altitudes above sea level range from 10 feet (3 m) on the coast and marshlands to 50-60 feet (15-18 m) on grasslands and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the highlands and hills, elevations rise to Mount Driskill, the highest point of the state at only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106," From 1932 to 2010, the State lost 1,800 square miles due to sea level rise and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,"The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CCRA) spends approximately $1 billion annually to assist in the establishment and protection of the shores and lands of Louisiana, both at the federal and state levels."
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"In addition to the previously named rivers, there are the Sabine River, which forms the western boundary; and the Pearl River, the eastern boundary; the Calcasieu River, the Mermentau River, the Vermilion River, the Bayou Teche, the Atchafalaya, the Boeuf River, the Bayou Lafourche River, the Courtableau River, the Bayou D'Arbonne River, the Macon River, the Tensas River, the Amite River, the Tchefuncte River, the Tickfaw River, the Natalbany River, and a number of other smaller rivers, constituting a natural network of waterways, with a length of more than 4,000 miles (6,400 km)."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The State also has political jurisdiction over the portion of approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) of underwater land on the inland continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110,"By a particular feature of the political geography of the United States, it is a territory far less than the 14 km wide jurisdiction of the neighbouring states of Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have vast Gulf coasts."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is one of the fastest disappearing areas in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112, This is largely due to poor management of the coast by humans (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one point, the land was added as spring floods of the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated the growth of the marshes; the land is now shrinking."
8114,17,louisiana,8114, There are many causes.
8115,17,louisiana,8115, Artificial dykes block spring floodwater that would bring fresh water and sediment to the marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"The marshes have been widely exploited, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move seawater inwards, where it damages swamps and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,The rise of seawaters has aggravated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119, Some researchers estimate that the state loses land mass equivalent to 30 football fields per day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120," There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including the restoration of natural floods in Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121," Without such a restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as communities disappear, more and more people leave the area."
8123,17,louisiana,8123," Since coastal wetlands support economically significant inshore fishing, the loss of wetlands is detrimental to this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,"The ""dead zone"" of the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States."
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"In 2017, it stood at 32730 km2 and was the largest ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico did not exist 250 million years ago while there was only one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As Pangea separates, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico open."
8128,17,louisiana,8128," Louisiana has slowly developed, over millions of years, from water to land, and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,The oldest rocks are exposed in the north in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest.
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date back to the early cenozoic era, about 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,The history of the formation of these rocks is found in D. Spearing's Roadside Geology of Louisiana.
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest parts of the state have been formed over the past 12,000 years as successive Mississippi deltas: the Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, the modern Mississippi, and now the Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133,The sediments were transported from north to south through the Mississippi River.
8134,17,louisiana,8134," Between the tertiary rocks of the north and relatively new sediments along the coast, there is a large belt known as Terrasses du Pleistocene."
8135,17,louisiana,8135, Their age and distribution can be largely related to sea-level rise and fall in late ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep canals, while the more recent terraces tend to be much more flattered."
8137,17,louisiana,8137, Salty domes are also found in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138, Their origin dates back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean experienced high evaporation rates.
8139,17,louisiana,8139," There are hundreds of salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140,The salt domes are important not only as a source of salt
8141,17,louisiana,8141," Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long, warm, humid and short summers, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical features of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its furthest point is not more than 200 mi (320 km)."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rain is common throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state wet season."
8144,17,louisiana,8144, There is a decrease in precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, storms are built during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief tropical showers."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In the winter, precipitation is more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June to September with an average of 90°F (32°C) or higher, and night bass with an average of over 70°F (21°C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148," Sometimes temperatures in the 90s F, combined with dew points in the 70s F higher, create sensible temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The wet, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and films."
8150,17,louisiana,8150,"The temperatures are generally warm in winter in the southern part of the state, with peaks around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico on average 66°F (19°C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the state is slightly cool in winter, with average levels of 59°F (15°C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152," Low nights in winter are on average well above freezing in the entire state, with 46°F (8°C) average near the Gulf and an average low of 37°F (3°C) in winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153," Occasionally, cold fronts, low pressure centres to the north, reach Louisiana in the winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154," Low temperatures near 20°F (−7°C) sometimes occur in the northern part of the state, but rarely in the southern part of the state."
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although people in the northern part of the state may receive snow dust a few times a decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"The highest recorded temperature in Louisiana was 114°F (46°C) at Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature was −16°F (−27°C) at Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157," Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to major hurricane strikes, particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, along with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can cause water damage in a large area due to major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The region is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state is on average more than 60 days of storms per year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161, Louisiana has an average of 27 tornadoes a year.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The entire State is vulnerable to a tornado, with the southern extreme part of the State slightly less than the rest of the State."
8163,17,louisiana,8163," Tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the State, and from February to March in the northern part of the State."
8164,17,louisiana,8164," Due to its location and geology, the state has a great biodiversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165," Some vital areas, such as southwestern prairie, have lost more than 98 per cent."
8166,17,louisiana,8166," Flat pines are also at great risk, mainly due to fire suppression and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167, There is not yet a well-organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168," Such a system would consist of a protected system of central areas linked by biological corridors, as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169," Louisiana contains a number of areas which, to varying degrees, prevent people from using them."
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to the service areas of the national parks and a national forest in the United States, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, a state conservation area, a state forest and many wildlife management areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of the largest public areas of Louisiana is the Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172," Its area is approximately 600,000 acres, more than half of which are flat forests, which are home to many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173, These include the Louisiana Snake and the Red Peacock Woodpecker.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The government-owned cypress marsh system around Pontchartrain Lake is another large area, with southern wetland species, including scratches, alligators, and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 base areas would be required to construct a ""protected area system"" for the state; these would be southwestern grasslands, the Pearl River floodplain to the east, and alluvial marshes from the Mississippi River to the north."
8176,17,louisiana,8176," Historical or picturesque areas managed, protected or otherwise recognized by the National Parks Service include:"
8177,17,louisiana,8177," Louisiana operates a network of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and a state preservation area."

8179,17,louisiana,8179,The Nature Conservancy also owns and manages a range of natural areas.
8180,17,louisiana,8180,"The Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System provides a degree of protection for 51 rivers, rivers and bayous rivers in the state."
8181,17,louisiana,8181,It is administered by Louisiana's Ministry of Wildlife and Fisheries.

8273,17,louisiana,8273,The Louisiana economy and its policy of the last half century cannot be understood without taking full account of the influence of the oil and gas industries.
8274,17,louisiana,8274,"For example, in the 1970s, over 40 per cent of Louisiana's public revenue came directly from mining taxes and royalties."
8275,17,louisiana,8275," Since the 1980s, the headquarters of these industries has been consolidated in Houston, but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the Gulf of Mexico's crude oil and gas industry remain in Louisiana."

8278,17,louisiana,8278," Louisiana is home to many, especially notable are the culture distinct from the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of colour, descendants of mixed families free from colonial periods and the early state."
8279,17,louisiana,8279,The French colony of La Louisiana struggled for decades to survive.
8280,17,louisiana,8280,"The conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were inadequate for certain crops that settlers knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281,The colonists and slaves they imported had high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"Settlers continued to import slaves, resulting in a high proportion of West Africans who continued to practice their culture in a new environment."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall described, they developed an African-Creole culture marked in colonial times."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a significant influx of white and Métis refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285," This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in Santo Domingo came from Africa than in the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286," They have strongly influenced the city's Afro-American culture in terms of dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is a fusion of French, African, Spanish (and other European) and Native American cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word criulo; originally it referred to a colonist of European origin (specifically French) born in the New World, compared to immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289," Louisiana's earliest manuscript to use the word ""Creole"" from 1782 applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,"But originally, he referred more generally to French settlers born in Louisiana."
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, a relatively large group of Colour Creoles (free coloured people) developed in the French colony, mainly descended from African slaves and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mixture, as well as some Native Americans)."
8292,17,louisiana,8292," Often, the French liberate their concubines and their Métis children and pass on social capital to them."
8293,17,louisiana,8293," They could educate sons in France, for example, and help them join the French army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294, They also placed property or capital on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295, Colourless people gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education
8296,17,louisiana,8296, Many have become craftsmen and owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""Creole"" became associated with this class of Colour Creoles, many of which obtained freedom well before the civil war."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,Rich French Creoles generally maintained city houses in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside the city along the Mississippi River.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans has the largest population of colour free people in the region; they can find work and create their own culture, marrying each other for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"Cajuns' ancestors migrated mainly from western central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally known as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301," After the British defeat of France in the War of France and India (Seven Years' War) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of Mississippi to Great Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated the families and expelled them from Acadia because they refused to devote their loyalty to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304," Some, who escaped from the British, remained in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305," Others dispersed in France, Canada, Mexico or the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306, Many Acadian refugees settled in southern Louisiana in the region around Lafayette and the country of LaFourche Bayou.
8307,17,louisiana,8307," They developed a distinct rural culture, different from the French Creole settlers in New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"By marrying others in the area, they developed what was known as music, cooking and Cajun culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309," Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered somewhat derogatory."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isleños.
8311,17,louisiana,8311," Its members were descendants of settlers from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and married other communities such as the French, Acadians, Creoles, Spaniards and other groups, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, the Isleños originally settled in four communities, including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313," Among these colonies, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most prosperous, with the other two suffering from diseases and floods."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,"The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community, while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) managed to preserve much of its unique culture and language in the 21st century."
8315,17,louisiana,8315," That being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs completely stopped in Saint Bernard with those who have the competence in Spanish being octagenary."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Over the centuries, the different communities of Isleño de Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canaries heritage while adopting and relying on the customs and traditions of the communities around them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317," Today, two heritage partners exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard and the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana."
8318,17,louisiana,8318,"The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated annually in the parish of Saint-Bernard, which presents heritage representations of local groups and the Canary Islands."
8319,17,louisiana,8319," According to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among people aged five and over, 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% French (standard French, French Creole or French Cajun), 3.30% Spanish and 0.59% Vietnamese."
8320,17,louisiana,8320," Historically, the Amerindian peoples of the region at the time of the European meeting were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321," Among them, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have live native speakers, although several other tribes work to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322," Other Amerindian peoples have migrated to the region, escaping from the Eastern European pressure."
8323,17,louisiana,8323," Among them were the Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples."
8324,17,louisiana,8324," Beginning in the 1700s, French settlers began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans."
8325,17,louisiana,8325, They have established French-language and cultural institutions.
8326,17,louisiana,8326," They imported thousands of tribal slaves from West Africa, who spoke several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the process of Creolization, the slaves developed a Creole dialect of Louisiana incorporating both French and African forms, which the colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, in particular, who spoke the Creole French of Louisiana."
8329,17,louisiana,8329," During the 19th century after the purchase of Louisiana by the United States, English gradually became more important for business and government due to the evolution of the population with the establishment by many Americans who were English-speaking."
8330,17,louisiana,8330, Many ethnic French-speaking families continued to use French in private.
8331,17,louisiana,8331,The slaves and some free people of color also spoke the Creole French of Louisiana.
8332,17,louisiana,8332,"The 1812 Constitution of the State grants official status to English in judicial proceedings, but the use of French remains widespread."
8333,17,louisiana,8333,The subsequent constitutions of the state reflect the decreasing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The 1868 Constitution, adopted at the time of reconstruction prior to the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, prohibits laws requiring the publication of judicial proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335," Later, the legal status of the French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its importance before the civil war."
8336,17,louisiana,8336," Several unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana."
8337,17,louisiana,8337,The dialects of the French language are colonial French and Houma French.
8338,17,louisiana,8338, Louisiana Creole French is the term for one of the Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339," Two unique dialects developed from the English language: Louisiana English, a variety of English with French influence in which the fall of /r/postvocalism is common; and what is informally called Yat, which resembles the dialect of New York City sometimes with southern influences, especially that of historic Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340," Both accents were influenced by large communities of Irish and Italian immigrants, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341, Colonial French was the dominant language of white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period.
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, the Métis people and the slaves developed Louisiana Creole, with a base in West African languages."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish domination at the end of the 18th century did not result in the widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"The French Creole and Louisiana are still used in modern Louisiana, often in family gatherings."
8345,17,louisiana,8345,"English and its associated dialects became predominant after the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, after which the area became dominated by many Anglophones."
8346,17,louisiana,8346,"In some areas, English was influenced by French, as was seen with Louisiana's English."
8347,17,louisiana,8347," Colonial French, although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English."
8348,17,louisiana,8348,"The renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana led to the creation of Canadian-style French immersion schools, as well as bilingual signage in the French historic neighbourhoods of New Orleans and Lafayette."
8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the State has maintained the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which promotes the use of the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and the international relations of the State."

8387,17,louisiana,8387, Louisiana's political and legal structure has maintained several elements at the time of French and Spanish governance.

8392,17,louisiana,8392," Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law derive their common legal origin, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as promulgated in 1804, after the purchase and annexation by the United States of Louisiana in 1803."

8394,17,louisiana,8394, There are differences between the civil law of Louisiana and the common law of other American states.
8395,17,louisiana,8395," Although some of these differences have been filled by the strong influence of the common law tradition, the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana's private law."
8396,17,louisiana,8396," Thus, the structure of property, contracts, businesses, much of civil and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are still based mainly on traditional Roman legal thinking."
8397,17,louisiana,8397,"In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or alliance."

8970,19,maryland,8970,"In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked on standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by parties); obtained closed polling stations to prevent party workers from assisting voters; launched primary elections to prevent party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates registered without party symbols, which discouraged illiterates from participating."
8971,19,maryland,8971, These measures have been taken against poorly educated whites and blacks.

8989,19,maryland,8989," Beginning in the 1960s, while suburban growth began around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to adopt a more mid-Atlantic culture, contrary to the traditional southern and tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state."

9000,19,maryland,9000,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Maryland population was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 4.71% over the 2010 U.S. census and 2,962 over the previous year."

10741,23,mississippi,10741," Mississippi is home to 63 crayfish species, including at least 17 endemic species."
10742,23,mississippi,10742, Mississippi is home to eight species of winter sandstone.
10743,23,mississippi,10743," Due to seasonal flooding, possible from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744,"The flood of the river created natural dikes, which the planters had built earlier to try to prevent flooding of cultivated land for cotton crops."
10745,23,mississippi,10745, Temporary workers built dikes along the Mississippi River above the natural dikes that formed from the land deposited after the flood of the river.
10746,23,mississippi,10746," From 1858 to 1861 the State assumed responsibility for the construction of dykes, carrying it out through contractors and labour hires."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters felt that their slaves were too valuable to be hired for such a dangerous job."
10748,23,mississippi,10748, Entrepreneurs have hired Irish immigrant gangs to build dykes and sometimes cleared land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749, Many Irish were relatively recent immigrants in the years of famine who struggled to settle.
10750,23,mississippi,10750," Prior to the U.S. Civil War, the average height of the dykes was six feet, although in some areas they reached twenty feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751," Floods have been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing land for cultivation and supply of wood for steamboats has removed the absorption of trees and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river were stripped bare, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753," After the civil war, major flooding swept the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754," These floods have regularly submerged the dikes damaged by the Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those built after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties."
10756,23,mississippi,10756,"In 1879, the United States Congress established the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included assisting the state dykes to build dykes."
10757,23,mississippi,10757,"In the late 19th century, temporary white and black workers were hired to build the dams."
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"By 1882 the dikes had an average height of seven feet, but many in the southern delta were severely affected by the flooding that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759," After the flood of 1882, the system of dykes was expanded."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the district of Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee was established to oversee the construction and maintenance of dykes in the northern delta counties, including some Arkansas counties that were part of the delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761," Floods submerged the northwest of Mississippi in 1912-13, causing heavy damage to the dyke districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,The regional losses and lobbying of the Mississippi River Levee Association for a flood control bill contributed to the passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide matching federal funds to local dyke districts on a scale of 2:1.
10763,23,mississippi,10763," Although U.S. participation in the First World War interrupted the financing of the dikes, the second round of funding helped to raise the average height of the dikes in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764, Scientists now understand that dykes have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow rate of the river and reducing the area of floodplains.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The area was severely damaged due to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which crossed the dikes."
10766,23,mississippi,10766," There have been losses of millions of dollars in goods, stocks and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The greatest damage occurred in the lower delta, including the counties of Washington and Bolivar."
10768,23,mississippi,10768," Although scientific knowledge of Mississippi has increased, upstream development and the consequences of dykes have caused more severe flooding over some years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769, Scientists now understand that widespread land clearing and dam construction have changed the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770," This work has eliminated the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, thus strengthening the flow of the river."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The federal and state governments have struggled for the best approaches to restoring certain natural habitats to better interact with the original river ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772," Nearly 10,000 Native Americans or Paleo-Indians from British Columbia have arrived in what is now called the South American."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,The southern Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that died after the late Pleistocene age.
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Amerindian colonies and agricultural fields were developed on natural dikes, a higher land near the rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Amerindians have developed large fields near their permanent villages.
10776,23,mississippi,10776," Along with other practices, they created localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777," After thousands of years, the successive cultures of the wood growing and Mississippi eras have developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which the surplus has supported the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778, Both were mound builders' cultures.
10779,23,mississippi,10779," Those in Mississippi culture were the largest and most complex, built from about 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,"People had a commercial network covering the continent, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf coast."
10781,23,mississippi,10781," Their great terrestrial works, expressing their cosmology of political and religious concepts, are still present in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys."
10782,23,mississippi,10782,The Amerindian tribes that descend from Mississippi culture in the southeast include Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783," Other tribes that lived in Mississippi (and whose names were honoured by settlers in local cities) included Natchez, Yazoo and Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who crossed the northeastern part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French settlers established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built in the vicinity of today's Ocean Springs on the Gulf coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was established by Pierre Le Moyne of Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,"In 1716, the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (like Fort Rosalie); it became the dominant town and trading post of the region."
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the largest territory ""New France""; the Spaniards continued to claim part of the Gulf Coast region (east of Mobile Bay) of the present-day southern Alabama, in addition to the entire area of Florida today."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"In the 18th century, the region was ruled by various Spanish, French and British colonial governments."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,Settlers imported African slaves as workers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791," Under French and Spanish domination, there has been the development of a class of people free of colour (people of free colour), mainly multiracial descendants of European men and black women slaves or free, and their Métis children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,"In the early days, the French and Spanish settlers were mainly men."
10793,23,mississippi,10793," While more and more European women have joined the colonies, men have race unions among women of African descent (and increasingly of multiracial ancestry), before and after the marriage of European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"European men often help their multiracial children to learn or acquire apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes settle on them; they often free mothers and their children if they are slaves, under placement contracts."
10795,23,mississippi,10795," With this social capital, people free of colour have become artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and real estate owners, forming a third class between Europeans and Africans the most slaves in the French and Spanish colonies, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796," After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (seven-year war), the French handed over the Mississippi region to them under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797," They also ceded their areas to the north east of Mississippi, including Illinois and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798," After the peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi fell under Spanish domination as part of Western Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819, the United States completed the purchase of Western Florida and all Eastern Florida in the Adams-Onís Treaty, and in 1822 the two were merged into Florida territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800," After the American Revolution (1765–83), Britain gave up this region to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801,The territory of Mississippi was organized on 7 April 1798 from the territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States.
10802,23,mississippi,10802, Their original colonial charters spread theoretically westward to the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803," Subsequently, the territory of Mississippi was expanded twice to include the disputed territory claimed by the United States and Spain."
10804,23,mississippi,10804," From about 1800 to 1830, the United States purchased land (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Amerindian tribes for new European American colonies."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mainly migrants from other southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were depleted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,"New settlers continued to encroach on the lands of Choctaw, and they urged the federal government to expel the Amerindians."
10807,23,mississippi,10807,"On September 27, 1830, the treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the U.S. government and the Choctaw."
10808,23,mississippi,10808,The Choctaws agreed to sell their traditional lands in Mississippi and Alabama for compensation and withdrawal of reserves in Indian territory (now Oklahoma).
10809,23,mississippi,10809, This opened up land for sale to the European-American migrant establishment.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 of the Treaty allows Choctaws who choose to remain in states to become American citizens, as they are considered to abandon their tribal affiliation."
10811,23,mississippi,10811," They were the second major American Aboriginal ethnic group to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas instead of joining the kidnapping)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812," Today, their descendants include approximately 9,500 people who identify themselves as Choctaw, and who live in the counties of Neshoba, Newton, Leake and Jones."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band reorganized in the 20th century and is a tribe recognized by the federal government.
10814,23,mississippi,10814," Many slave owners brought African-American slaves with them or bought them through the slave trade, especially in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"As a result of this trade, it is estimated that nearly one million slaves were forcibly transported to the deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke many families of Upper South slaves, where planters were selling surplus slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816, Southerners imposed slave laws in the deep South and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817," From 1822 on, Mississippi slaves were protected by law from cruel and unusual penalties imposed by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,"In most cases, the slave codes of the South have made the deliberate murder of a slave illegal."
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, in Mississippi 1860, Oliver v. State accused the accused of killing his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820,"The Mississippi became the 20th state on December 10, 1817."
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes was the first Governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as an ancestral land by several Amerindian tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823,"The plantations were developed mainly along the main rivers, where the seafront provided access to the main transport routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"It is also where the first cities develop, linked by steamboats that transport commercial products and crops to the markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The rest of the Amerindian ancestral lands remained largely undeveloped, but were sold by treaty until 1826 when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826,"As a result of the abolition of the Choctaw Tribal Government by the Mississippi State Legislative Assembly in 1829, the Indian Abduction Act of President Andrew Jackson and the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty of 1830, the Choctaws were forced to sell their land and were transported to Oklahoma territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, as well as other southeastern tribes abducted under the Act, has become known as the Tears Trail."
10828,23,mississippi,10828," When cotton was king in the 1850s, the owners of Mississippi plantations – especially those in the central Delta and black belt regions – became rich because of the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market and the free labour acquired thanks to their African-American enslavement outfit."
10829,23,mississippi,10829, They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830, Planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for work and serious wealth imbalances among whites have played an important role both in state policy and in supporting planters for secession.
10831,23,mississippi,10831,The Mississippi was a slave society whose economy depended on slavery.
10832,23,mississippi,10832,"The State was sparsely populated, with the population concentrated in riparian areas and towns."
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"In 1860, the enslaved Afro-American population numbered 436,631, representing 55 per cent of the total State population, or 791,305 persons."
10834,23,mississippi,10834," Less than 1,000 people were free of colour."
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively small population of the State prior to the civil war reflected the fact that land and villages were only developed along the banks of the river, which formed the main transport corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836, Ninety per cent of the bottom land in the delta was still at the border and undeveloped.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The state needs much more settlers for development.
10838,23,mississippi,10838,Land farther from the rivers was cleared by liberated men and white migrants during reconstruction and later.

10853,23,mississippi,10853," Some black delegates were released, but others were educated free blacks who had emigrated from the North."
10854,23,mississippi,10854,"The Convention had adopted universal suffrage; removed titles to vote or office, a change which had also benefited both blacks and poor whites; provided for the first State system of public schools; prohibited racial distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited the limitation of civil rights in travel."
10855,23,mississippi,10855,"As part of the reconstruction, the Mississippi was restored to the Union on 23 February 1870."
10856,23,mississippi,10856," Because the Mississippi Delta contained so much fertile bottom land that had not been developed before the civil war, 90 per cent of the land was still at the border."

11225,24,missouri,11225,"It seems to be popular etymology — Illinois spoke an Algonquian language and the closest approximation that can be made in that of their close neighbours, the Ojibwe, is ""You should go down and visit these people."""
11226,24,missouri,11226," This would be a strange event, because the French who first explored and tried to settle in Mississippi generally obtained their translations during this fairly precise period, often giving things French names that were accurate translations of the mother tongue(s)."
11227,24,missouri,11227," Assuming that Missouri is derived from the Siwan language, it translates as ""it connects to its side"", with reference to the river itself."
11228,24,missouri,11228,"It's not quite probable either, because it would be like ""Maya Sunni"" (Mah-yah soo-nee)."
11229,24,missouri,11229," Most likely, however, the name Missouri comes from Chiwere, a Siwan language spoken by people who lived in the modern states of Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri and Nebraska."
11230,24,missouri,11230,"The name ""Missouri"" has several different pronunciations even among its natives today, the two most common being (listen) miz-UR-ee and (listen) miz-UR-."
11231,24,missouri,11231," Other pronunciations also exist in Missouri or elsewhere in the United States, involving the realization of the medial consonant as either or ; the vowel in the second syllable as either or ; and the third syllable as (phonetically [i] (listening), [=] (listening) or [=] (listening) or."
11232,24,missouri,11232, Any combination of these phonetic achievements can be observed from speakers of American English.
11233,24,missouri,11233,"In English, the pronunciation has been received, the preferred variant is miz-OR-ee, the setting-OR-ee being a possible alternative."
11234,24,missouri,11234," Linguistic history was definitely dealt with by Donald M. Lance, who acknowledged that the issue was sociologically complex, but no pronunciation could be declared ""correct"", nor clearly defined as native or external, rural or urban, southern or northern, educated or not."
11235,24,missouri,11235," Politicians often use multiple pronunciations, even in a single speech, to appeal to a greater number of listeners."
11236,24,missouri,11236,"In informal contexts, the name of the state, such as ""Missour-ee"" or ""Missour-uh"", is sometimes used to distinguish phonetic pronunciations."

11238,24,missouri,11238," However, the unofficial nickname of Missouri is the ""Show Me State"", which appears on its license plates."
11239,24,missouri,11239, This sentence has many origins.
11240,24,missouri,11240,"One was largely attributed to a speech by MP Willard Vandiver in 1899, who said that ""I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and democrats, and the sparkling eloquence does not convince me or satisfy me."
11241,24,missouri,11241,"I'm from Missouri, and you need to show me."""
11242,24,missouri,11242," This is in line with the saying ""I'm from Missouri,"" which means ""I'm sceptical about the issue and not easily convinced."""
11243,24,missouri,11243," However, according to the researchers, the expression ""show me"" was already used before the 1890s."
11244,24,missouri,11244," Another indicates that this is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado, to replace the workers on strike."
11245,24,missouri,11245," Since the new men were not familiar with mining methods, they need frequent instruction."
11246,24,missouri,11246," Other nicknames of Missouri include ""The Lead State"", ""The State of Bullion"", ""The State of Ozark"", ""The Mother of the West"", ""The State of the Iron Mountain"" and ""Western Pennsylvania""."
11247,24,missouri,11247,"It is also known as the ""State of the Cave"" because there are more than 7,300 caves registered in the State (second in Tennessee)."
11248,24,missouri,11248,Perry County is the county that has the largest number of caves and the longest.
11249,24,missouri,11249,"The official motto of the state is Latin: ""Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto"", meaning ""Let the well-being of the people be the supreme law""."
11250,24,missouri,11250, Indigenous peoples inhabited Missouri for thousands of years before European exploration and colonization.
11251,24,missouri,11251," Archaeological excavations along the rivers have shown a continuous habitation for more than 7,000 years."
11252,24,missouri,11252," Beginning in the year 1000, there was the complex culture of Mississippi, whose people created regional political centres at the present time, Saint-Louis, and on the other side of the Mississippi River, at Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois."
11253,24,missouri,11253, Their large cities included thousands of individual residences.
11254,24,missouri,11254," Yet, they are known for their massive earth-moving mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platform, summit and conical form."
11255,24,missouri,11255,Cahokia was the centre of a regional trading network that reached from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
11256,24,missouri,11256," Civilization declined by 1400, and most of the descendants left the region long before the arrival of Europeans."
11257,24,missouri,11257,Saint Louis was at a time known by American Europeans as Mound City because of the many prehistoric mounds that have survived since lost for urban development.
11258,24,missouri,11258," Mississippi culture left mounds in the mid-Missippi and Ohio valleys, extending to the southeast and upper rivers."
11259,24,missouri,11259,The land that became the state of Missouri was part of many different territories had changing and often undetermined borders and had many different Amerindian and European names between the 1600s and state status.
11260,24,missouri,11260,"For most of the first half of the 1700s, the western shore of Mississippi that was to become the Missouri was largely uninhabited, a land of no man who kept peace between Illinois on the east shore of Mississippi and north, and the Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley."
11261,24,missouri,11261,"In the early 1700s, French merchants and missionaries explored the entire Mississippi Valley, known as the Louisiana region.At the same time, a different group of French Canadians established five villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River placed their colonies in Illinois, Illinois."
11262,24,missouri,11262,"Genevieve, they continued to place their establishments in Illinois."
11263,24,missouri,11263,"At the same time, French colonies on both sides of Mississippi were part of the French province of Louisiana."
11264,24,missouri,11264,"To distinguish the colonies in the Middle Mississippi Valley from the French colonies in the Lower Mississippi Valley around New Orleans, French officials and residents called the Middle Mississippi Valley the Upper Louisiana, the Upper Louisiana, or the Upper Louisiana."
11265,24,missouri,11265,"The first European settlers were mainly French-Canadians, who created their first settlement in Missouri at the present time in Ste."
11266,24,missouri,11266,"Geneviève, about one hour south of Saint-Louis."
11267,24,missouri,11267, They had migrated about 1750 from Illinois.
11268,24,missouri,11268," They came from colonial villages on the east side of Mississippi, where soils were becoming exhausted, and there was not enough ground for the growing population."
11269,24,missouri,11269,"The early colonies of Missouri included many African and Amerindian slaves, and slave labor was at the heart of commercial agriculture and the fur trade."
11270,24,missouri,11270,"Sainte-Geneviève became a prosperous agricultural centre, producing enough surplus wheat, corn and tobacco to ship tons of grain annually to Lower Louisiana for trade."
11271,24,missouri,11271, Grain production in Illinois was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.
11272,24,missouri,11272,Saint Louis was founded shortly afterwards by Pierre Laclède and the son-in-law Auguste Chouteau de la Nouvelle-Orléans in 1764.
11273,24,missouri,11273," From 1764 to 1803, European control of the region west of Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri basin, known as Louisiana, was assumed by the Spaniards as part of the vice-royalty of New Spain, because of the Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order for Spain to join France in the war against England)."
11274,24,missouri,11274,The arrival of the Spaniards in Saint-Louis took place in September 1767.
11275,24,missouri,11275,"Saint-Louis became the centre of a regional fur trade with the Amerindian tribes that extended the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades."
11276,24,missouri,11276,The trading partners of the major companies shipped their furs from Saint-Louis through the river to New Orleans to export them to Europe.
11277,24,missouri,11277, They provided a variety of goods to merchants for sale and trade with their Amerindian customers.
11278,24,missouri,11278,The fur trade and associated companies have made St. Louis an early financial centre and have provided wealth for some to build beautiful houses and import luxury goods.
11279,24,missouri,11279, Its location near Illinois's confluence meant that it also treated products from agricultural areas.
11280,24,missouri,11280, Traffic and river trade along the Mississippi River are an integral part of the state economy.
11281,24,missouri,11281,"As the first major city in the region, Saint-Louis expanded considerably after the invention of the steamboat and the growth of river trade."
11282,24,missouri,11282, Napoleon Bonaparte had acquired Louisiana for the French ownership of Spain in 1800 under the treaty of San Ildefonso after having been a Spanish colony since 1762.
11283,24,missouri,11283,But the treaty has been kept secret.
11284,24,missouri,11284," Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the transfer to the United States."
11285,24,missouri,11285,"Part of the purchase of Louisiana by the United States in 1803, Missouri became known as the western gateway because it served as an important starting point for expeditions and settlers heading west in the 19th century."
11286,24,missouri,11286,"Saint-Charles, just west of Saint-Louis, was the starting point and return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which went up the Missouri River in 1804 to explore the lands from the west to the Pacific Ocean."
11287,24,missouri,11287,St. Louis was an important supply point for decades for settler parties heading west.
11288,24,missouri,11288,"As many of the early settlers from Western Missouri emigrated from the Upper South, they brought African-American slaves as agricultural workers, and they wanted to continue their culture and the institution of slavery."
11289,24,missouri,11289," They settled mainly in 17 counties along the Missouri River, in a plains area that allowed plantation farming and became known as the Little Dixie."
11290,24,missouri,11290,The state was shaken by the earthquakes of 1811 to 1812.
11291,24,missouri,11291, There were few losses due to the scarcity of the population.
11292,24,missouri,11292,"In 1821, the former Missouri territory was admitted as a slave state, under the compromise of Missouri, and with a temporary state capital in Saint Charles."
11293,24,missouri,11293,"In 1826 the capital was moved to its current permanent location in Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River."
11294,24,missouri,11294," Originally, the western border of the state was a straight line, defined as the meridian passing through Kawsmouth, the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River."
11295,24,missouri,11295,The river has moved since this designation.
11296,24,missouri,11296, This line is known as the Osage Border.
11297,24,missouri,11297,"In 1836, the purchase of the Platte was added to the northwest corner of the state after the purchase of the lands of the native tribes, making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River."
11298,24,missouri,11298," This addition increased the area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to the 65,000 square miles of Virginia, which then included West Virginia)."
11299,24,missouri,11299,"In the early 1830s, Mormon migrants from the northern states and Canada began to settle near independence and just north of the island."
11300,24,missouri,11300," Conflicts over religion and slavery have arisen between the ""former settlers"" (mainly from the south) and the Mormons (mainly from the north)."
11301,24,missouri,11301,The Mormon War broke out in 1838.
11302,24,missouri,11302,"In 1839, with the help of a ""order of extermination"" by Governor Lilburn Boggs, the former settlers forcibly expelled the Mormons of Missouri and confiscated their lands."
11303,24,missouri,11303, Slavery-related conflicts exacerbated border tensions between states and territories.
11304,24,missouri,11304," From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with Iowa over what is known as the Honey Lands led to the initiation by the two militia states along the border."
11305,24,missouri,11305," With the increase in migration from 1830 to 1860, the Missouri population nearly doubled every decade."
11306,24,missouri,11306," Most new arrivals were born in the United States, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s."
11307,24,missouri,11307," Since the majority were Catholics, they set up their own religious institutions in the state, most of which had been Protestant."
11308,24,missouri,11308," Many settled in cities, creating a regional network and then a state of Catholic churches and schools."
11309,24,missouri,11309,German immigrants from the 19th century created the wine industry along Missouri and the beer industry in Saint-Louis.
11310,24,missouri,11310," While many German immigrants were highly anti-slavery, many Irish immigrants living in cities were pro-slavery, fearing that the liberation of African-American slaves would create a mass of unskilled labour, reducing wages."
11311,24,missouri,11311, Most Missouri farmers were engaged in subsistence farming before the American civil war.
11312,24,missouri,11312,The majority of those who were slaves had less than five each.
11313,24,missouri,11313," Planters, defined by some historians as having about 20 or more slaves, were concentrated in counties known as ""Little Dixie"" in the central part of the state along the Missouri River."
11314,24,missouri,11314,Tensions on slavery relate mainly to the future of the State and the nation.
11315,24,missouri,11315,"In 1860, African-American enslaved persons accounted for less than 10 per cent of the state's population, or 1,182,012."
11316,24,missouri,11316,"In order to control the flooding of agricultural land and low-lying villages along Mississippi, the state had completed the construction of 230 kilometres of dykes along the river in 1860."
11317,24,missouri,11317," After the secession of the southern states began in 1861, the Missouri parliament called for the election of a special convention on secession."
11318,24,missouri,11318,Pro-South Governor Claiborne F. Jackson ordered the mobilization of several hundred members of the state militia who had assembled in a camp in Saint-Louis to train.
11319,24,missouri,11319," Alarmed by this action, the General Union Nathaniel Lyon strikes first, encircling the camp and forcing the troops of the State to surrender."
11320,24,missouri,11320,"Lyon directed his soldiers, largely non-English-speaking German immigrants, to walk the prisoners in the streets, and opened fire on the widely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them."

11651,25,montana,11651, Montana is a state in the northwestern part of the United States.
11652,25,montana,11652,"It is bordered by Idaho to the west, North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan to the north."
11653,25,montana,11653,"It is the fourth largest state per region, the eighth smallest populous state and the third smallest densely populated state."
11654,25,montana,11654,"The western half of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges, while half is characterized by prairie terrain and western badlands, with more (although smaller) mountain ranges throughout the state."
11655,25,montana,11655,A total of 77 designated areas are part of the Rocky Mountains.
11656,25,montana,11656," Montana has no official nickname, but several unofficial names, including ""Big Sky Country"", ""The Treasure State"", ""Land of the Shining Mountains"" and ""The Last Best Place""."
11657,25,montana,11657,"The economy is based mainly on agriculture, including livestock and grain farming."
11658,25,montana,11658," Other significant economic resources include oil, gas, coal, mining and lumber."
11659,25,montana,11659,"The health care, services and government sectors are also important to the state economy."
11660,25,montana,11660,"The fastest growing area in Montana is tourism, with nearly 13 million annual tourists visiting Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Beartooth Highway, Flathead Lake, Big Sky Resort and other attractions."
11661,25,montana,11661,"The name Montana comes from the Spanish word montaña, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, meaning ""mountain"" or more widely ""mountainous country""."
11662,25,montana,11662,Montaña del Norte is the name given by the first Spanish explorers to the whole western mountainous region.
11663,25,montana,11663,The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill of the United States House Committee on Territories (then chaired by James Ashley of Ohio) for the territory that was to become the territory of Idaho.
11664,25,montana,11664," Representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained of Montana, changed their names."
11665,25,montana,11665," When Ashley introduced a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be dug into Idaho, he again chose the territory of Montana."
11666,25,montana,11666," This time, Rep. Samuel Cox, also from Ohio, objected to the name."
11667,25,montana,11667,Cox complained that the name was a bad name because most of the territory was not mountainous and an Amerindian name would be more appropriate than a Spanish name.
11668,25,montana,11668," Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but the Territorial Committee decided that they could appoint him as they wished, so that the original name of Montana was adopted."
11669,25,montana,11669, Montana is one of eight mountain states to the north of the region known as the Western United States.
11670,25,montana,11670,It borders North Dakota and South Dakota in the east.
11671,25,montana,11671,"Wyoming is to the south, Idaho to the west and south-west, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan are to the north, making it the only state to have a border with three Canadian provinces."
11672,25,montana,11672," With an area of 147,040 square miles (380 800 km2), Montana is slightly larger than Japan."
11673,25,montana,11673,"It is the fourth largest state in the United States after Alaska, Texas, and California; it is the largest landlocked state."
11674,25,montana,11674,"State topography is roughly defined by the continental division, which divides much of the state into distinct regions of the east and west."
11675,25,montana,11675," Most of the hundreds or more of Montana's mountain ranges are located in the western half of the state, most of which are geologically and geographically located in northern Rocky Mountains."
11676,25,montana,11676,The Absaroka and Beartooth chains in the south-central part of the state are technically part of the central Rocky Mountains.
11677,25,montana,11677,The Rocky Mountain Front is an important feature of the north-central part of the state and isolated island chains that interrupt the common prairie landscape in the central and eastern parts of the state.
11678,25,montana,11678," About 60 per cent of the state is a prairie, which is part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains, one of the longest continuous expanses of the Alaskan Rocky Mountains in Mexico, as well as smaller expanses, including the Alene Heart Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the Idaho State."
11680,25,montana,11680,The southern third of Bitterroot's range mixes in continental division.
11681,25,montana,11681," Other large mountain ranges west of the ditch include the Cabinet Mountains, Anaconda Range, Missions, Garnet Range, Sapphire Mountains, and Flint Creek Range."
11682,25,montana,11682,"The north section of the division, where the mountains quickly gave way to the prairies, was part of the Rocky Mountain Front."
11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is the most prominent in the Lewis Range, located mainly in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684," Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (starting on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska) crosses this area and turns east into Montana at Triple Divide Peak."
11685,25,montana,11685,"It causes the Waterton, Belly, and Saint Mary rivers to flow north of Alberta, Canada."
11686,25,montana,11686," There, they joined the Saskatchewan River, which eventually spilled into Hudson Bay."
11687,25,montana,11687,"To the east of the ditch, several roughly parallel ranges cover the southern part of the state, including the Gravelly Range, the Madison Range, the Gallatin Range, the Absaroka Mountains and the Beartooth Mountains."
11688,25,montana,11688,"The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass of more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) in height in the American continent."
11689,25,montana,11689,"It contains the highest point in the state, Granite Peak, 12,799 feet (3,901 m) high."
11690,25,montana,11690,"To the north of these chains are the large belt mountains, Bridger Mountains, tobacco roots and several island chains, including the wild mountains and Little Belt Mountains."
11691,25,montana,11691, Between many mountain ranges there are rich river valleys.
11692,25,montana,11692,"The Big Hole Valley, the Bitterroot Valley, the Gallatin Valley, the Flathead Valley and the Paradise Valley have extensive agricultural resources and offer many opportunities for tourism and recreation."
11693,25,montana,11693,"To the east and north of this transition zone are the large and sparsely populated northern plains, with plateau meadows, smaller island mountain ranges and badlands."
11694,25,montana,11694,"The remote islands east of the Divide include the Bear Paw, Bull Mountains, Castle Mountains, Crazy Mountains, Highwood Mountains, Judith Mountains, Little Belt Mountains, Little Rocky Mountains, the Pryor Mountains, Little Snowy Mountains, Big Snowy Mountains, Sweet Grass Hills and — in the southeast corner of the state near Ekalaka — the Long Pines."
11695,25,montana,11695, Many of these isolated areas were created about 120 to 66 million years ago when the magma ripped off from the inside and prostrated in front of the earth's surface.
11696,25,montana,11696,The area east of the ditch in the north-central part of the state is known for the Missouri Breaks and other important rock formations.
11697,25,montana,11697," Three butts south of Great Falls are major landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw and Buttes."
11698,25,montana,11698," Known as lacoliths, they formed when the igneous rock crossed cracks in the sedimentary rock."
11699,25,montana,11699,The underlying surface is made up of sandstone and shale.
11700,25,montana,11700,"The area's surface soils are very diverse and heavily affected by local geology, whether it is a glazed plain, an intermountainous basin, mountain foothills or plateaus."
11701,25,montana,11701,"The areas of the foothills are often covered with broken stones or slates or exposed bare rocks (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil of the intermountainous basins generally consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt and volcanic ash, much of which is made up of lakes that covered the area during the oligocene 33-23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"The plateaus are often surmounted by argillite gravel and worn quartzite, sometimes submerged by the shale."
11704,25,montana,11704,"The glaciated plains are generally covered with clay, gravel, sand, and silt left by Great Falls Proglacial Lake or by moraines or old gravel-covered lake basins left by the glaciation of Wisconsin 85,000 to 11,000 years ago."
11705,25,montana,11705," Further east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka house some of the most picturesque areas of the state."
11706,25,montana,11706,The Hell Creek Formation in northeastern Montana is a major source of dinosaur fossils.
11707,25,montana,11707,The paleontologist Jack Horner of the Bozeman Rockies Museum brought this training to the attention of the world with several major discoveries.
11708,25,montana,11708," Montana has thousands of named rivers and streams, 720 km of which are known for the blue-ribbon trout fishery."
11709,25,montana,11709," Montana's water resources provide recreation, hydropower, crop and fodder irrigation, mining and water services for human consumption."
11710,25,montana,11710," Montana is one of the few geographic regions in the world where rivers form parts of three major watersheds (i.e., the Great Lakes)."
11711,25,montana,11711, where two continental divisions cross each other).
11712,25,montana,11712," Its rivers feed the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay."
11713,25,montana,11713,The watersheds are divided into Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park.
11714,25,montana,11714," While Hudson Bay is considered part of the Arctic Ocean, Triple Divide Peak is the only place on Earth with a three-ocean drainage."
11715,25,montana,11715,All waters of Montana west of the division's flow into the Columbia River.
11716,25,montana,11716,"The Columbia Clark fork (not to be confused with the Clarks fork in the Yellowstone River) rises near Butte and flows northwest to Missoula, where it is joined by the Blackfoot River and the Bitterroot River."
11717,25,montana,11717," Further downstream, it is joined by the Flathead River before entering Idaho near Lake Pend Oreille."
11718,25,montana,11718,The Pend Oreille River forms the flow of Lake Pend Oreille.
11719,25,montana,11719,"The Pend Oreille River joins the Columbia River, flowing to the Pacific Ocean, making the Clark Fork/Pend Oreille River, 932 km long, the longest of the Rocky Mountains."
11720,25,montana,11720,The Clark fork releases the largest volume of water from any river coming out of the state.
11721,25,montana,11721,"The Kootenai River, in northwestern Montana, is another major tributary of Colombia."
11722,25,montana,11722,"To the east of the division, the Missouri River, formed by the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin rivers near Three Forks, flows north across the central western part of the state to Great Falls."
11723,25,montana,11723," From then on, it usually flows eastward through fairly flat farmland and the Missouri breaks to the Fort Peck reservoir."
11724,25,montana,11724,"The section of the river between Fort Benton and the Fred Robinson Bridge, at the western limit of the Fort Peck Reservoir, was designated a wild and scenic national river in 1976."
11725,25,montana,11725,"Missouri entered North Dakota near Fort Union, draining more than half the area of Montana (82,000 square miles (210 000 km2))."
11726,25,montana,11726," Nearly a third of the Missouri River in Montana is behind 10 dams: Toston, Canyon Ferry, Hauser, Holter, Black Eagle, Rainbow, Cochrane, Ryan, Morony and Fort Peck."
11727,25,montana,11727," Other major tributaries of Missouri Montana include the Smith, Milk, Marias, Judith and Musselshell rivers."
11728,25,montana,11728,"The Montana also claims the disputed title of possession of the world's shortest river, the Roe River, just outside Great Falls."
11729,25,montana,11729," Through Missouri, these rivers finally reach Mississippi and flow into the Gulf of Mexico."
11730,25,montana,11730,"Hell Roaring Creek begins in southern Montana and when combined with Red Rock, Beaverhead, Jefferson, Missouri and Mississippi, it is the longest river in North America and the fourth longest river in the world."
11731,25,montana,11731,The Yellowstone River rises on the continental ditch near the summit of the Wyoming's Teton Wilderness youth.
11732,25,montana,11732,"It crosses Yellowstone National Park north, entering Montana near Gardiner and crossing the Paradise Valley to Livingston."
11733,25,montana,11733,"It then crosses the northeast of the state through Billings, Miles City, Glendive and Sidney."
11734,25,montana,11734,"The Yellowstone joined Missouri in North Dakota, just east of Fort Union."
11735,25,montana,11735,"It is the longest undamaged open river in the United States, draining about a quarter of Montana (36,000 square miles (93,000 km2)."
11736,25,montana,11736,"The major tributaries of Yellowstone are the Boulder, Stillwater, Clarks Fork, Bighorn, Tongue and Powder Rivers rivers."
11737,25,montana,11737,"The Northern Divide turns east at Montana at Triple Divide Peak, so the Waterton, Belly and Saint Mary rivers flow north to Alberta."

11764,25,montana,11764, These lands are managed by the State for the benefit of State schools and institutions.
11765,25,montana,11765, Areas managed by National Parks Service include:
11766,25,montana,11766," Montana is a great state with considerable variations in geography, topography and altitude, and the climate is therefore also varied."
11767,25,montana,11767,"The state extends from the 45th parallel (the equidistant line between the equator and the North Pole) to the 49th parallel, and altitudes range from less than 2,000 feet (610 m) to nearly 13,000 feet (4,000 m) above sea level."
11768,25,montana,11768,"The west half is mountainous, interrupted by many large valleys."
11769,25,montana,11769," Eastern Montana includes plains and badlands, broken by isolated hills and mountain ranges, and has a semi-arid and continental climate (Köppen BSk climate classification)."
11770,25,montana,11770,"The continental divide has a considerable effect on the climate, as it limits the warmer air flow in the Pacific from the east and the drier continental air from the west."
11771,25,montana,11771,"The area west of the ditch has a modified climate in the north of the Pacific coast, with milder winters, cooler summers, less wind and a longer growing season."
11772,25,montana,11772," Low clouds and fog often form in the valleys west of the ditch in winter, but this is rarely seen to the east."
11773,25,montana,11773, Average daily temperatures range from 28°F or -2.2°C in January to 84.5°F or 29.2°C in July.
11774,25,montana,11774,Variation in geography leads to a large variation in temperature.
11775,25,montana,11775,"The highest summer temperature was 117°F or 47.2°C at Glendive on 20 July 1893, and at Medicine Lake on 5 July 1937."

11780,25,montana,11780,"On January 20, 1954, −70°F or −56.7°C was recorded in a gold mining camp near Rogers Pass."
11781,25,montana,11781," Temperatures vary considerably during cold nights, and Helena, at 64 km to the southeast, experienced only a low of -36°F or -37.8°C on the same date, and a record low of -42°F or -41.1°C."
11782,25,montana,11782,Winter cold spells are usually the result of the cold continental air coming from southern Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The front is often well defined, resulting in a sharp drop in temperature in 24 hours."
11784,25,montana,11784," Conversely, the south-west airflow translates into ""chinooks""."
11785,25,montana,11785," These steady winds from 25 to 50 mph (40 to 80 km/h) (or more) can suddenly warm up parts of Montana, especially areas just east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise to 50 to 60 degrees F (10 to 15.6 degrees Celsius) for 10 days or more."
11786,25,montana,11786,Loma is the site of the most extreme temperature change recorded during a 24-hour period in the United States.
11787,25,montana,11787,"On 15 January 1972, a chinook wind blew and the temperature rose from -54°F to 49°F (−47.8°C to 9.4°C)."
11788,25,montana,11788, Average annual precipitation is 15 inches (380 mm) but large variations are observed.
11789,25,montana,11789,"The mountain ranges block the damp air of the Pacific, holding moisture in the western valleys and creating rain shadows in the east."
11790,25,montana,11790,"Heron in the west receives the most precipitation, 34.70 inches (881 mm)."
11791,25,montana,11791,"On the east side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine has an average of 11.45 inches (291 mm) and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation."
11792,25,montana,11792,"The mountains can receive more than 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the Grinnell Glacier glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches (2,700 mm)."
11793,25,montana,11793,An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a 16-year period.
11794,25,montana,11794, Most major cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year.
11795,25,montana,11795,Mountain chains can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow in winter.
11796,25,montana,11796," Strong snowstorms can occur from September to May, although most snowfall occurs from November to March."
11797,25,montana,11797,The climate has become hotter in Montana and continues to do so.
11798,25,montana,11798,Glacier National Park glaciers have declined and are expected to disappear completely in a few decades.
11799,25,montana,11799," Many cities in Montana recorded record heat in July 2007, the warmest month ever recorded in Montana."
11800,25,montana,11800,Winters are also warmer and have less cold spells.
11801,25,montana,11801," Previously, these cold spells had killed the beetles, but they are now attacking the forests of western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the area allowed various species to expand their range and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, beetle attack and poor management resulted in a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804," According to a study by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some parts of Montana will experience a 200 per cent increase in forest fire burning and 80 per cent in related air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below shows average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month of the seven largest cities in Montana.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on location, although the figures are generally similar."
11807,25,montana,11807, Montana is one of only two contiguous states (with Colorado) that are antipodal to land.
11808,25,montana,11808,The Kerguelen Islands are antipodal at the Montana/Saskatchewan/Alberta border.
11809,25,montana,11809,"No city is exactly antipodal in Kerguelen, although Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples have lived in the territory of the present state of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811," Historical tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers in the United States included the Crow in south-central, Cheyenne in the very southeast, Blackfeet, Assiniboine and Gros Ventres in central and north-central, and Kootenai and Salish in the west."
11812,25,montana,11812,The smallest Pend d'Oreille and Kalispel tribes lived near Flathead Lake and the western mountains respectively.
11813,25,montana,11813,A portion of southeastern Montana was used as a corridor between the Crows and the associated Hidatas in North Dakota.
11814,25,montana,11814,The lands of Montana east of the continental ditch were part of Louisiana's purchase in 1803.
11815,25,montana,11815," Subsequently, and particularly in the decades following the Lewis and Clark expeditions, American, British and French traders operated a fur trade, generally working with Aboriginal peoples, both in the east and west of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816," These transactions have not always been peaceful, and although the fur trade has brought material gain to Aboriginal tribal groups, it has also led to exposure to European diseases and has changed their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The trading post Fort Raymond (1807–11) was built in Crow's Indian country in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818," Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), lands west of the continental division were disputed between the British and the United States and were known as Oregon countries."
11819,25,montana,11819,The first permanent establishment by the Euro-Americans in what is now Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near Stevensville today.
11820,25,montana,11820,In 1847 Fort Benton was established as a senior fur trade post on the Missouri River.
11821,25,montana,11821,"In the 1850s, settlers began to settle in the Beaverhead and Big Hole valleys from the Oregon Trail and the Clark Forks Valley."
11822,25,montana,11822,"The first gold discovered in Montana was at Gold Creek, near the current garrison in 1852."
11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of important mining discoveries in the western third of the state from 1862 onward found gold, silver, copper, lead and coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area."
11824,25,montana,11824,"The richest of all gold placer digs was discovered in Alder Gulch, where the city of Virginia City was established."
11825,25,montana,11825," Other rich placer deposits have been found in Last Chance Gulch, where the city of Helen, Confeder Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City is now located."
11826,25,montana,11826,Gold production from 1862 to 1876 reached $144 million.
11827,25,montana,11827,"The largest mining operations were in the town of Butte, which had large deposits of silver and huge copper deposits."
11828,25,montana,11828," Prior to the creation of the territory of Montana (1864–89), the present regions of Montana were part of Oregon (1848–59), Washington (1853–63), Idaho (1863–64) and Dakota (1861–64)."
11829,25,montana,11829," Montana became a territory of the United States (Montana Territory) on May 26, 1864."
11830,25,montana,11830,The first territorial capital was at Bannack.
11831,25,montana,11831,The first territorial governor was Sidney Edgarton.
11832,25,montana,11832,The capital moved to Virginia City in 1865 and to Helena in 1875.
11833,25,montana,11833,"By 1870, the non-Indian population of Montana was 20,595."
11834,25,montana,11834,"The Montana Historical Society, founded February 2, 1865 in Virginia City, is the oldest such institution west of Mississippi (excluding Louisiana)."
11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870, respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and Washburn–Langford–Doane expeditions were launched from Helen into the Upper Yellowstone area and led directly to the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As the settlers began to populate Montana from the 1850s to the 1870s, disputes ensued with the Amerindians, mainly over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, the territorial governor of Washington, Isaac Stevens, negotiated the Hellgate Treaty between the U.S. government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai of western Montana, which established boundaries for tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838,The treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839," While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reserve, the difficulty with the interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led the Whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was open to colonization, but the tribal nations challenged these provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first U.S. Army post in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect the traffic of steamboats going to Fort Benton."
11842,25,montana,11842,More than a dozen additional military outposts have been established in the State.
11843,25,montana,11843, Pressure on land ownership and control has increased as a result of gold discoveries in various regions of Montana and surrounding states.
11844,25,montana,11844,"Major battles took place in Montana during the Red Cloud War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, the Noz Perce War and in the conflicts with Piegan Blackfeet."
11845,25,montana,11845,"The most notable are the Marias Massacre (1870), the Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), the Battle of the Great Trou (1877) and the Battle of Bear Paw (1877)."
11846,25,montana,11846,The last conflict in Montana between the U.S. Army and the Amerindians occurred in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in Big Horn's country.
11847,25,montana,11847,Indian survivors who have signed treaties are usually required to make reservations.
11848,25,montana,11848," Along with these conflicts, bison, a key arch species and the main source of proteins on which Aboriginal people had survived for centuries, were being destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849,It is estimated that more than 13 million bison were in Montana in 1870.
11850,25,montana,11850,"In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded for a joint session of Congress to authorize the slaughter of herds in order to deprive the Indians of their food source."
11851,25,montana,11851,"By 1884, the commercial hunt had led the bison to the brink of extinction; only 325 bison remained throughout the United States."
11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle farming is at the heart of Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and exchanged fattened cattle in fertile Montana valleys with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.
11853,25,montana,11853,Nelson Story brought Texas Longhorn's first cattle into the territory in 1866.
11854,25,montana,11854,"Granville Stuart, Samuel Hauser and Andrew J. Davis began a large open pit operation in Fergus County in 1879."
11855,25,montana,11855,The Ranch Grant-Kohrs National Historic Site at Deer Lodge is now maintained as a link to the late 19th-century breeding style.
11856,25,montana,11856," This is a 1,900-acre (7.7 km2) ranch operated by the National Parks Service."
11857,25,montana,11857,The tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad (NPR) reached Montana from the west in 1881 and from the east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858," However, in the 1870s, the railway played a major role in tensions with the Amerindian tribes."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, president of the NPR, launched important surveys in the Yellowstone Valley in 1871, 1872 and 1873, which the Sioux strongly contested under the leadership of Chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860," These clashes, in part, contributed to the panic of 1873, a financial crisis which delayed the construction of the railway in Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"Surveys carried out in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped trigger the Great Sioux War of 1876."
11862,25,montana,11862,"The transcontinental PNR was completed on September 8, 1883, at Gold Creek."
11863,25,montana,11863,"The Great Northern Railway (GNR) tracks reached the east of Montana in 1887, and when they reached the north of the Rocky Mountains in 1890, the GNR became a major tourism promoter in the Glacier National Park area."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893 at Scenic, Washington."
11865,25,montana,11865,"In 1881, the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch of the Union Pacific, completed a narrow line from northern Utah to Butte."
11866,25,montana,11866,"A number of small spur lines operated in Montana from 1881 to the 20th century, including the Oregon Short Line, Montana Railway, and Milwaukee Road."
11867,25,montana,11867," Under the authority of territorial governor Thomas Meagher, the Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a unsuccessful attempt to become a state."
11868,25,montana,11868,A second constitutional convention held in Helena in 1884 produced a constitution ratified 3:1 by the citizens of Montana in November 1884.
11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress only approved state status in Montana in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting state status in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington after the appropriate state constitutions had been drafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,In July 1889 the Montanans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government.
11871,25,montana,11871,"On November 8, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana the 41st State of the Union."
11872,25,montana,11872,The first state governor was Joseph K. Toole.
11873,25,montana,11873,In the 1880s Helena (the state capital) had more millionaires per capita than any other city in the United States.
11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land to settlers who could claim and ""proven"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875, Montana did not see a large influx of immigrants under the Act because 160 acres were generally insufficient to support a family in arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,"In 1868 David Carpenter, near Helen, made the first claim under the Montana law."
11877,25,montana,11877,"The first claim of a woman was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana's pioneer, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"In 1880 the farms were in the greenest valleys of central and western Montana, but few were in the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Lands Act of 1877 was passed to permit the establishment of dry lands in the west and awarded 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a $25 per acre price and a promise of irrigation of the land.
11880,25,montana,11880," After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would belong to the settler."
11881,25,montana,11881," This law has brought most cattle and sheep farmers to Montana, many of whom have taken their herds to the Montana prairie for three years, has done little to irrigate the land, and then abandoned it without paying the last fee."
11882,25,montana,11882," Some farmers arrived with the arrival of the Northern and Northern Pacific Great Railways in the 1880s and 1890s, although in relatively small numbers."
11883,25,montana,11883,"In the early 1900s James J. Hill, from the Great North, began to promote the settlement on the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods."
11884,25,montana,11884, Other railways have followed.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the law on rehabilitation was passed, allowing the construction of irrigation projects in the eastern river valleys of Montana."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909, Congress passed the Extended Houses Act, which extended the area of open land from 160 acres to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family, and in 1912 reduced the time to ""proven"" a claim to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Homesteads Act allowed 640 acres of homesteads in areas unfit for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888," This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of landowners, attracted to free land, with World War I bringing particularly high wheat prices."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana was experiencing a temporary period of higher than average rainfall."
11890,25,montana,11890,"The owners arriving at that time were known as ""Honyockers"", or ""scissors""."
11891,25,montana,11891," Although the word ""honyocker"", perhaps derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisory way to the owners as ""green horns"", ""new to his business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had agricultural experience, although many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892," However, farmers are facing a number of problems."
11893,25,montana,11893, Massive debt was one.
11894,25,montana,11894,"In addition, most settlers came from wetter areas, were not prepared for dry climate, lack of trees and scarcity of water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small houses less than 320 acres (130 ha) were not adapted to the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896, Weather and agricultural conditions are much harsher and drier to the west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897, Then the droughts of 1917-1921 proved devastating.
11898,25,montana,11898," Many people left, and half of the state banks went bankrupt by providing mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, the size of the holdings has increased, while the number of holdings has decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"In 1910, the owners filed claims on more than five million acres, and in 1923, over 93 million acres were cultivated."
11901,25,montana,11901,"By 1910, the Great Falls Land Office alone had more than a thousand property deposits per month, and at the top of 1917-1918, it had 14,000 new properties every year."
11902,25,montana,11902, Significant decreases occurred as a result of the 1919 drought.
11903,25,montana,11903,"As the First World War broke out, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States declaration of war."
11904,25,montana,11904," His actions were widely criticized in Montana, where war support and patriotism were strong."
11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917–18, due to miscalculation of the Montana population, approximately 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the state population, volunteered or were recruited into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906, This represented a labour contribution to the war that was 25 per cent higher than any other state on a per capita basis.
11907,25,montana,11907," Approximately 1500 Montanans died as a result of the war and 2437 were injured, as well as more than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908," Montana Remount station in Miles City provided 10,000 horse cavalry horses for the war, more than any other military post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for Montana's interests in mining, lumber and agriculture, as the demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the American Congress adopted the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the Sedition Act of 1918."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Parliament of Montana passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912," Together, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, the military, or symbols by speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana law led to the arrest of more than 200 persons and the conviction of 78 persons, mainly of German or Austrian origin."
11914,25,montana,11914,More than 40 people spent time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, Governor Brian Schweitzer granted full posthumously pardons to all persons convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed the entry of the United States into the war included groups of immigrants of German and Irish origin, as well as pacifist anabaptists such as the Hutterites and Mennonites, many of whom were also of Germanic origin."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-war groups such as the Montana Council of Defense, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and the local ""loyalty committees"" were formed."
11918,25,montana,11918,The feeling of war was complicated by labour problems.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The Anaconda Copper Company, which was at its historic peak in copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and trade unions that were trying to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multi-ethnic community composed of major European immigrants, trade unions, in particular the new Metal Mining Workers' Union, opposed the war on the grounds that they mostly benefited from important interests in the softwood lumber and mining sector."
11921,25,montana,11921," Following the explosion of mining production and the disaster of the speculatory mine in June 1917, Frank Little, world organizer of industrial workers, arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave speeches with an incendiary anti-war rhetoric.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On August 1, 1917, he was dragged from his boarding school by masked vigilantes, and hanged on a railway lattice, considered a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,The murder of Little and the ensuing strikes led to the dispatch of the National Guard to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925," Overall, anti-German and anti-labor sentiment has increased and created a movement that led to the adoption of the Montana Sedition Act the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Defence Council had become a State body empowered to prosecute and punish persons tried in violation of the law."
11927,25,montana,11927,The Council has also adopted rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting the expression of German in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"In the wake of the 1918 legislative action, emotions increased."
11929,25,montana,11929,U.S. prosecutor Burton K. Wheeler and several district court judges who have hesitated to prosecute or convict accused persons have been strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930," Wheeler was brought before the Defence Council, although he avoided formal proceedings, and a judge of the Forsyth District Court was indicted."
11931,25,montana,11931, There were burns of German-speaking books and several quasi-hangings.
11932,25,montana,11932,The ban on German speaking remained in force at the beginning of the 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Compliing the struggles in wartime, the 1918 influenza epidemic claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanians."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that took place led some historians to dub this period ""the agony of Montana""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after the First World War and lasted during the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936," This has caused great difficulties for farmers, herders and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937," Wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state an important producer; wheat has a relatively high protein content, which requires high prices."
11938,25,montana,11938,"By the time the United States entered World War II on December 8, 1941, many Montanas had enlisted in the army to escape the bad national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Over 40,000 Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year after the declaration of war, and more than 57,000 joined before the end of the war."
11940,25,montana,11940," These figures represented about 10 per cent of the population of the state, and Montana once again provided one of the largest numbers of soldiers per capita in any state."
11941,25,montana,11941," Many Amerindians were among those who served, including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,"At least 1,500 Montanans died in the war."
11943,25,montana,11943," Montana was also the training ground of the First Special Service Force or ""Devil's Brigade"", an American commando-type joint force that was training at Fort William Henry Harrison for the experience of mountain and winter conditions prior to its deployment."
11944,25,montana,11944,"Air bases were built in Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank and Glasgow, some of which were used as assembly areas to prepare aircraft for the Soviet Union's allied forces."
11945,25,montana,11945," During the war, about 30 Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs landed in Montana, but no casualties or major forest fires were attributed to them."
11946,25,montana,11946,In 1940 Jeannette Rankin was again elected to Congress.
11947,25,montana,11947,"In 1941, as it had done in 1917, she voted against the United States declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
11948,25,montana,11948," His was the only vote against the war, and following a public outcry over his vote, Rankin demanded police protection for a period of time."
11949,25,montana,11949," Other pacifists tended to be those of the ""peace churches"" that were generally opposed to war."
11950,25,montana,11950, Many people claiming the U.S. conscientious objector status were sent to Montana during the war as twins of smoke and for other tasks of fighting forest fires.
11951,25,montana,11951,"In 1942, the U.S. Army established camp Rimini near Helen to train sled dogs in winter."
11952,25,montana,11952," During the Second World War, the planned USMontana warship was named in honor of the state, but it was never completed."
11953,25,montana,11953, Montana is the only one of the first 48 states that do not have a full warship to be named.
11954,25,montana,11954, Both Alaska and Hawaii have nuclear submarines that bear their names.
11955,25,montana,11955, Montana is the only state in the Union without a modern naval ship named in its honour.

12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was caused by the discovery of gold in the region, and officials thought that Nevada would be better able to monitor the expected demographic boom."

12738,27,nevada,12738," Appeals from district courts are addressed directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which, as part of a model derogatory jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the Court of Appeal for final resolution."
12739,27,nevada,12739,"The cities incorporated in Nevada, known as cities, have the power to legislate on anything not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to allow local authorities to integrate the cities of Nevada in order to give them more flexibility and less restrictions on the part of the Legislative Assembly.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"Municipal councils for unincorporated cities are limited local administrations created either by the local county commission or by referendum, and constitute a purely consultative role and do not in any way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"In 1900, Nevada's population was the smallest of all states and decreased, as the difficulties of living in a ""wild desert"" began to prevail over the lure of money for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743,The historian Lawrence Friedman explained what happened next:
12744,27,nevada,12744," With the advent of air conditioning for the summer and the mild winters of southern Nevada, the state's fortunes began to turn around, as for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growth in the Union."
12745,27,nevada,12745, Nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal – in an approved brothel in a county that has expressly voted to allow it.
12746,27,nevada,12746,"It is illegal in major jurisdictions such as Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), Washoe County (which contains Reno) and the Independent City of Carson City."
12747,27,nevada,12747," Nevada's first reputation as a ""divorce paradise"" came from the fact that before the revolution of no-fault divorce in the 1970s, divorces were difficult to obtain in the United States."
12748,27,nevada,12748," Having already legalized gambling and prostitution, Nevada has continued to strengthen its profile by adopting one of the most liberal divorce laws in the nation."
12749,27,nevada,12749," Accordingly, Williams v. North Carolina (1942), 317 US 287 (1942), in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that North Carolina must give ""full faith and credit"" to a divorce from Nevada."
12750,27,nevada,12750,"The Court changed its decision in Williams v. North Carolina (1945), 325 United States 226 (1945), stating that a State did not need to recognize a divorce in Nevada, unless one of the parties was domiciled there at the time the divorce was granted and the forum State had the right to make its own decision."
12751,27,nevada,12751,"In 2009, Nevada's divorce rate was above the national average."
12752,27,nevada,12752, Nevada's tax laws are designed to attract new residents and businesses to the state.

12756,27,nevada,12756,"The state-wide tax rate is 6.85 per cent and five counties (Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt and Mineral) charge this amount."
12757,27,nevada,12757," Counties may charge additional rates through the approval of electors or through the approval of the state's legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax varies from 6.85 per cent to 8.57 per cent (Clark County)."
12758,27,nevada,12758,"Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county option taxes in addition to the state-wide rate: 0.25% for flood control, 0.50% for public transit, 0.25% for infrastructure, and 0.25% for more cops."
12759,27,nevada,12759,"In Washoe County, which includes Reno, the sales tax rate is 7.725 per cent, due to the flood control county option rates, the ReTRAC railway trench project and public transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act, 1991."

12766,27,nevada,12766," Nevada offers a friendly environment for company formation, and many companies (especially in California) have formed in Nevada to take advantage of the benefits of Nevada's law."
12767,27,nevada,12767, Nevada companies offer a great deal of flexibility to the board of directors and simplify or avoid many of the rules that are burdensome for entrepreneurs in other states.
12768,27,nevada,12768,"In addition, Nevada has no duty-free tax, although it requires companies to have a licence for which the company must pay the State."
12769,27,nevada,12769," Similarly, many U.S. states have laws of wear and tear that limit the amount of interest a lender can charge, but federal law allows companies to import these laws from their home state."
12770,27,nevada,12770, Levada has very liberal laws on alcohol.
12771,27,nevada,12771,"Bars are allowed to stay open 24 hours a day, without ""last call""."

12773,27,nevada,12773,"In 2016, Nevada voters approved Question 2, which legislates the possession, transport and cultivation of quantities of marijuana for personal use for adults 21 years of age and older, and authorizes the creation of a regulated market for the sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age and older through state-licensed retail outlets."
12774,27,nevada,12774, Nevada voters had already approved medical marijuana in 2000 but rejected the legalization of marijuana in a similar referendum in 2006.
12775,27,nevada,12775,Marijuana in all its forms continues to be illegal under federal law.
12776,27,nevada,12776,"In addition to legalizing cannabis, the laws on non-alcoholic drugs are a notable exception to the libertarian principles of Nevada."
12777,27,nevada,12777,It is remarkable to have the most severe penalties for drug offenders in the country.
12778,27,nevada,12778, Nevada remains the only State to continue to use mandatory guidelines on minimum penalties for possession of drugs.
12779,27,nevada,12779,"In November 2006, Nevada voters promulgated a smoking ban (""Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act""), which came into force on 8 December 2006."

12789,27,nevada,12789," Due to strong growth in the southern part of the State, there is a significant gap between northern and southern Nevada politics."
12790,27,nevada,12790,"The north has long maintained control of key positions in the state government, although the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the combined state."
12791,27,nevada,12791,The north sees the large population of the south become more influential and perhaps dominant by the majority.
12792,27,nevada,12792,"The south sees the north as the ""old guard"" trying to rule as an oligarchy."
12793,27,nevada,12793," This has aroused some resentment, however, due to an amendment to the time limit adopted by Nevada voters in 1994, and again in 1996, part of the northern grip on key positions will soon be confiscated to the south, leaving the north of Nevada with less power."
12794,27,nevada,12794," Historically, the north of Nevada has been very republican."

12805,27,nevada,12805," This includes Nevada supporting the Democrats John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960 and 1964, respectively."

16232,36,oregon,16232,The first proof of the name Oregon has Spanish origins.
16233,36,oregon,16233,"The term ""orejón"" (meaning ""great ear"") comes from the historical chronicle Relación de la Alta y Baja California (1598) written by the new Spanish Rodrigo Montezuma and refers to the Columbia River when Spanish explorers entered the current North American territory which became part of the vice-royalty of New Spain."
16234,36,oregon,16234, This chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source of the place name Oregon.
16235,36,oregon,16235," There are also two other sources of Spanish origin, such as oregano, which refers to a plant that grows in the southern part of the region."
16236,36,oregon,16236,"It is possible that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, because there is a stream in Spain called ""Arroyo del Oregón"" (which is located in the province of Ciudad Real); it is also possible that the ""j"" in the Spanish expression ""El Orejón"" was later corrupted into a ""g"", and in the context could refer to the ""aurore"" of the massive Columbia river at its mouth."
16237,36,oregon,16237," Another early use of the name, spelled Ouragon, was by Major Robert Rogers in a petition of 1765 to the Kingdom of Great Britain."

16240,36,oregon,16240,"Rogers wrote,"
16241,36,oregon,16241,"A theory is that the name comes from the French word Ouragan (""windstorm"" or ""hurricane""), which was applied to the West River from Indian tales of powerful Chinook winds on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from the first-hand French experience with the Chinook winds of the Great Plains."
16242,36,oregon,16242,"At that time, it was thought that the western river would rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the Great Plains."
16243,36,oregon,16243,Joaquin Miller explained in Sunset magazine in 1904 how Oregon's name was derived:
16244,36,oregon,16244," Another narrative, approved as ""the most plausible explanation"" in the book Oregon Geographic Names, was advanced by George R. Stewart in an article from 1944 in American Speech."
16245,36,oregon,16245," According to Stewart, the name comes from the error of a engraver in a French map published at the beginning of the 18th century, on which the Ouisiconink River (Wisconsin) was spelled ""Ouaricon-sint"", broken on two lines with the -sint below, so there seems to be a river flowing to the west called ""Ouaricon""."

17785,40,south_dakota,17785,"To the south, east of the Black Hills, lies the Badlands of South Dakota."
17786,40,south_dakota,17786,"The erosion of the Black Hills, marine skeletons fallen to the bottom of a large shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this region."

17826,40,south_dakota,17826,European contact with the region began in 1743 when the LaVérendrye brothers explored the region.
17827,40,south_dakota,17827,"The LaVérendrye group buried a plaque near the site of modern Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of the Greater Louisiana."
17828,40,south_dakota,17828,"In 1762, the entire region was part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802."

17830,40,south_dakota,17830,"In 1803 the United States purchased the territory of Louisiana, a region that included most of Napoleon Bonaparte's South Dakota, and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly known as the ""Lewis and Clark Expedition"" to explore the region."
17831,40,south_dakota,17831,"In 1817, an American fur trade post was established at the present Fort Pierre, which began the continued American colonization of the area."
17832,40,south_dakota,17832,"In 1855, the American army purchased Fort Pierre, but abandoned it in 1857, in favour of Fort Randall in the south."
17833,40,south_dakota,17833,"At that time, the establishment by the Americans and Europeans increased rapidly, and in 1858 the Yankton Sioux signed the Treaty of 1858, giving to the United States most of the present South Dakota."
17834,40,south_dakota,17834,Speculators founded two of the largest cities today in South Dakota: Sioux Falls in 1856 and Yankton in 1859.

17837,40,south_dakota,17837,In 1874 gold was discovered in the Black Hills during a military expedition led by George A. Custer and miners and explorers began illegally entering the land promised to the Lakota.
17838,40,south_dakota,17838,The Custer expedition took place despite the fact that the Sioux had received the entire western half of the present South Dakota (West River) in 1868 by the treaty of Laramie under the Great Reserve of Sioux.
17839,40,south_dakota,17839,"The Sioux refused to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and the war broke out after the United States did not stop white miners and settlers from entering the area."
17840,40,south_dakota,17840," Finally, the United States won and separated the Sioux Great Reserve into five reserves, settling Lakota there."
17841,40,south_dakota,17841,"In 1980, the Supreme Court and Congress ordered compensation, but the Lakota still refused to accept it, insisting on the return of their lands."
17842,40,south_dakota,17842,"An increasing population and political concerns (the accession of two states meant the arrival of four new senators for the Republican Party) led to the division of Dakota territory and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations that officially admitted South Dakota and North Dakota to union on November 2, 1889."
17843,40,south_dakota,17843, Harrison had the papers tight to obscure which was first signed and the order was not recorded.
17844,40,south_dakota,17844,"On December 29, 1890, the massacre of the injured knee occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve."

17847,40,south_dakota,17847,"In the 1930s, several economic and climate conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota."
17848,40,south_dakota,17848," Lack of precipitation, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states."
17849,40,south_dakota,17849,"The fertile soil was blown into massive dust storms, and several crops were completely destroyed."
17850,40,south_dakota,17850,"The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with the seizure of local banks and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, have led many South Dakota to leave the state."

17860,40,south_dakota,17860," Despite the growth of the state's population and recent economic development, many rural areas have struggled over the past 50 years with the decline of local populations and the emigration of educated young adults to major South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states."
17861,40,south_dakota,17861,Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture have greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of small family farms and the resulting economic and demographic difficulties for rural cities.
17862,40,south_dakota,17862," However, the state often ranks first for its way of life, and Gallup's 2018 Well-Being Index named South Dakota the happiest and most healthy state in the United States."
17863,40,south_dakota,17863,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of South Dakota was 884,659 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 8.66 per cent since the 2010 U.S. census, while only North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming have fewer residents."

17879,40,south_dakota,17879, Five of the state's counties are entirely within the borders of sovereign Indian reserves.
17880,40,south_dakota,17880," Due to the limitations of climate and land and the isolation of urban areas with higher employment opportunities, the standard of living on many South Dakota reserves is often well below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009."
17881,40,south_dakota,17881,"The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, Crow Creek Reserve, is 70% and 21% of households do not have plumbing or basic kitchen appliances."
17882,40,south_dakota,17882,A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found that 58% of households on the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve did not have telephones.
17883,40,south_dakota,17883,"The isolation of reserves also hinders their ability to generate income from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centres."
17884,40,south_dakota,17884,"In 1995, the legislature passed a law to make English the ""common language"" of the State."
17885,40,south_dakota,17885," Since 2019, ""the language of the Great Sioux Nation, composed of three dialects, Dakota, Lakota and Nakota"" is an official language."

17893,40,south_dakota,17893,Young people settled in cities for other jobs.
17894,40,south_dakota,17894," This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 counties of South Dakota losing their population between 1990 and 2000."
17895,40,south_dakota,17895," During this period, nine counties suffered a population loss of more than 10 per cent, with Harding County in the northwest corner of the state losing nearly 19 per cent of its population."
17896,40,south_dakota,17896, Low birth rates and lack of young immigrants have led to an increase in the median age of many of these counties.
17897,40,south_dakota,17897,"In 24 counties, at least 20 per cent of the population is over the age of 65, compared with a national rate of 12.8 per cent."

18081,41,tennessee,18081," Occupied by Union forces from 1862 onwards, he was the first State to be re-admitted to the Union at the end of the war."
18082,41,tennessee,18082,"Tennessee has provided more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state except Virginia, and more soldiers for the Union Army than the rest of the combined Confederation."
18083,41,tennessee,18083," From the reconstruction he had a competitive party policy, but a democratic takeover in the late 1880s had led to the adoption of laws on the abandonment of the right to vote which excluded most blacks and many poor whites from the right to vote."
18084,41,tennessee,18084," This reduced competition in politics in the state until after the adoption of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century, although unlike in the deep South, the Republicans of Tennessee still expected at least one third of the state-wide vote via the East Tennessee and the Highland Rim Unionists."
18085,41,tennessee,18085,"In the 20th century, Tennessee moved from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, aided by massive federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Authority and, in the early 1940s, in the city of Oak Ridge."
18086,41,tennessee,18086," This city was founded just outside Knoxville to house the Manhattan project's uranium enrichment facilities, helping to build the world's first atomic bombs, two of which were dropped on Imperial Japan towards the end of World War II."
18087,41,tennessee,18087," After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became and remains a key centre of scientific research."
18088,41,tennessee,18088,"In 2016, the tennessine element was named for the state, largely in recognition of the roles played by Oak Ridge, Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee in discovering the element."
18089,41,tennessee,18089,"Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing and tourism."
18090,41,tennessee,18090,"Poultry, soybeans and livestock are the government's main agricultural products, and major manufacturing exports include chemicals, transportation equipment and electrical equipment."
18091,41,tennessee,18091,"Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited national park in the country, is located in the eastern part of the state, and part of the Appalachian Trail follows roughly the border between Tennessee and North Carolina."
18092,41,tennessee,18092," Other major tourist attractions include the Aquarium du Tennessee and the Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel in Chattanooga; Dollywood in Pigeon Forge; the Aquarium de Ripley des Smokies and Ober Gatlinburg in Gatlinburg; the Parthenon, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville; the Jack Daniel distillery in Lynchburg; the Elvis Presley residence and tomb, the Memphis Zoo, the National Museum of Civil Rights in Memphis; and the Bristol Highway in Bristol."
18093,41,tennessee,18093,"The first variant of the name became Tennessee was recorded by Captain Juan Pardo, the Spanish explorer, when he and his men passed through an American Indian village named ""Tanasqui"" in 1567 while traveling inland to South Carolina."
18094,41,tennessee,18094,"At the beginning of the 18th century, British traders met a city of Cherokee called Tanasi (or ""Tanase"", in the syllable : """") in the present Monroe County, Tennessee."
18095,41,tennessee,18095,The town was located on a river of the same name (now known as the Little Tennessee River) and appears on the maps as early as 1725.
18096,41,tennessee,18096,"It is not known if it was the same city as Juan Pardo's, although recent research suggests that Pardo's ""Tanasqui"" was located at the confluence of the Pigeon River and the French Broad River near modern Newport."
18097,41,tennessee,18097,The meaning and origin of the word is uncertain.
18098,41,tennessee,18098, Some accounts suggest that this is a Cherokee modification of a Yuchi word earlier.
18099,41,tennessee,18099,"It is said to be a meeting place, a wind river, or a large bend river."
18100,41,tennessee,18100," According to ethnograph James Mooney, the name ""can't be analyzed"" and its meaning is lost."
18101,41,tennessee,18101,"The modern spelling, Tennessee, is attributed to James Glen, the governor of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence in the 1750s."
18102,41,tennessee,18102,"The spelling was popularized by Henry Timberlake's publication ""Drawing of the Cherokee Country"" in 1765."
18103,41,tennessee,18103,"In 1788, North Carolina established Tennessee County, the third county to be established in what is now the Middle Tennessee."
18104,41,tennessee,18104,(Tennessee County was the predecessor of the present-day counties of Montgomery and Robertson.)
18105,41,tennessee,18105," When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state outside the South-West territory, it adopted ""Tennessee"" as the name of the state."
18106,41,tennessee,18106,"Tennessee is known as The Volunteer State, a nickname that some claimed to have won during the War of 1812 because of the important role played by Tennessee volunteer soldiers, especially during the Battle of New Orleans."
18107,41,tennessee,18107," Other sources differ as to the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to volunteers for the war between Mexico and America from 1846 to 1848."
18108,41,tennessee,18108," This explanation is more likely, because President Polk's call for 2,600 national volunteers at the beginning of the Mexico-America war resulted in only 30,000 Tennessee volunteers, largely in response to Davy Crockett's death and the appeals of the former Tennessee governor and then Texas politician Sam Houston."
18109,41,tennessee,18109,"Tennessee borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north; North Carolina to the east; Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi to the south; Arkansas and Missouri to the west."
18110,41,tennessee,18110,Tennessee is linked to Missouri as a State bordering most other states.
18111,41,tennessee,18111,The state is sorted by the Tennessee River.

18113,41,tennessee,18113,"Clingmans Dome, located on the eastern border of Tennessee, is the highest point on the Appalachian trail, and is the third highest peak in the United States east of Mississippi."
18114,41,tennessee,18114,The state line between Tennessee and North Carolina crosses the top.
18115,41,tennessee,18115,The lowest point in the state is the Mississippi River at the Mississippi State Line: 54 meters.
18116,41,tennessee,18116,The geographical center of the State is located in Murfreesboro.
18117,41,tennessee,18117,"The state of Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically and legally divided into three major divisions: Eastern Tennessee, Middle Tennessee and Western Tennessee."
18118,41,tennessee,18118,The Constitution of the State does not allow more than two judges of the five-member Supreme Court of Tennessee to come from a large division and a similar rule applies to certain commissions and commissions.
18119,41,tennessee,18119,"Tennessee has six main physiographic regions: the Blue Ridge, the Appalachian Ridge and the valley region, the Cumberland Plateau, the Highlands Coast, the Nashville Basin and the Gulf Coast Plain."

18123,41,tennessee,18123,"A small part of north central Tennessee in the counties of Sumner, Macon and Clay is located in the Green River watershed."
18124,41,tennessee,18124, These three basins are tributaries of the Ohio watershed.
18125,41,tennessee,18125, Most of the western Tennessee lies in the lower Mississippi River watershed.
18126,41,tennessee,18126,"The entire state is located in the Mississippi watershed, with the exception of a small area of the counties of Bradley and Polk crossed by the Conasauga River, which is part of the mobile bay watershed."
18127,41,tennessee,18127,"The Blue Ridge area is on the eastern edge of Tennessee, which borders North Carolina."
18128,41,tennessee,18128," This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the Western Blue Ridge Mountains, which are subdivided into several sub-ranges, namely the Smoky Great Mountains, the Baldes Mountains, the Unicoi Mountains, the Unaka and Roan Highlands Mountains, and the Iron Mountains."
18129,41,tennessee,18129,"The average altitude in the Blue Ridge area is 1,500 metres above sea level."

18131,41,tennessee,18131,"The Blue Ridge area has never been so sparsely populated, and today much of it is protected by the Cherokee National Forest, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness areas and state parks."
18132,41,tennessee,18132,"The Ridge and Valley area, where many tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Tennessee Valley, is located about 89 km west of the Blue Ridge."
18133,41,tennessee,18133, This area of Tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges such as Mount Bays and Mount Clinch.
18134,41,tennessee,18134,"The western part of the Tennessee Valley, where depressions become wider and ridges lower, is called the Great Valley."
18135,41,tennessee,18135,"In this valley are many cities and two of the three urban areas in the region, Knoxville, the third largest city in the state, and Chattanooga, the fourth largest city in the state."
18136,41,tennessee,18136,"The third urban area, the Tri-Cities, including Bristol, Johnson City and Kingsport and their surroundings, is northeast of Knoxville."
18137,41,tennessee,18137,Cumberland plateau rises west of Tennessee Valley
18138,41,tennessee,18138,"The altitude of the Cumberland Plateau ranges from 1,500 to approximately 2,000 feet (460 to approximately 610 m) above sea level."
18139,41,tennessee,18139,"East Tennessee has several important transport links with the Middle and Western Tennessee, as well as the rest of the country and the world, including several major airports and interstates."
18140,41,tennessee,18140,"The McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) in Knoxville and Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA) in Chattanooga, as well as the Tri-Cities Regional Airport (TRI), provide air service to many destinations."
18141,41,tennessee,18141,"I-24, I-81, I-40, I-75 and I-26, as well as many state highways and other important roads, cross the Grande Division and connect Chattanooga, Knoxville and the Tri-Cities, as well as other cities such as Cleveland, Athens and Sevierville."

18144,41,tennessee,18144,The Nashville Basin is characterized by a rich and fertile agricultural country and a wide variety of natural fauna.
18145,41,tennessee,18145,The Middle Tennessee was a common destination for settlers who crossed Appalachians from Virginia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
18146,41,tennessee,18146,"An important trade route called Natchez Trace, created and used for many generations by American Indians, connects the middle Tennessee to the city of the lower Mississippi of Natchez."
18147,41,tennessee,18147,The Natchez Trace route was used as the basis for a panoramic highway called Natchez Trace Parkway.
18148,41,tennessee,18148, Some of the last large American chestnut trees grow in this region.
18149,41,tennessee,18149, They are used to help reproduce burning-resistant trees.
18150,41,tennessee,18150,The average Tennessee is one of the main centres of the population and transport of the state as well as the heart of the state government.

18154,41,tennessee,18154,"The Gulf Coast Plain is, in terms of area, the predominant terrestrial region of Tennessee."
18155,41,tennessee,18155,It is part of the vast geographical area that begins in the Gulf of Mexico and extends north to southern Illinois.
18156,41,tennessee,18156,"In Tennessee, the Gulf Coast Plain is divided into three sections that extend from the Tennessee River to the east to the Mississippi River to the west."
18157,41,tennessee,18157,"The eastmost stretch, about 16 km wide, consists of hilly lands along the west bank of the Tennessee River."
18158,41,tennessee,18158,To the west of this narrow strip of land is a vast area of rolling hills and streams extending to the Mississippi River

18162,41,tennessee,18162,Memphis is the economic center of western Tennessee.
18163,41,tennessee,18163," Most of the West Tennessee remained an Indian land until the Passion of Chickasaw in 1818, when the Chickasaw gave up its land between Tennessee and Mississippi."
18164,41,tennessee,18164,The portion of Chickasaw's divestment in Kentucky is now known as the Jackson Purchase.
18165,41,tennessee,18165,The areas under the control and management of the National Parks Service are:
18166,41,tennessee,18166," Fifty-four state parks, with an area of approximately 132,000 acres (530 km2), as well as portions of Grands Monts Smoky National Park and Cherokee National Forest, and Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, are located in Tennessee."
18167,41,tennessee,18167," Athletes and visitors are attracted to Reelfoot Lake, originally formed by the earthquakes of 1811–12; the stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, as well as the lotus bed that covers the shallow waters, give the lake a strange beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168," Most of the condition has a wet subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a temperate or humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee's climate, with southern winds accounting for most of the annual precipitation in the state."
18170,41,tennessee,18170,"In general, the state has warm summers and mild to cold winters with generous precipitation throughout the year, with the highest average monthly precipitation generally in winter and spring, between December and April."
18171,41,tennessee,18171,"The driest months, on average, are August to October."
18172,41,tennessee,18172,"On average, the state receives 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation each year."
18173,41,tennessee,18173,The snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13 cm) in West Tennessee to more than 80 inches (200 cm) in the highest mountains of East Tennessee.

18175,41,tennessee,18175,"Winters tend to be mild to cold, increasing in coolness at higher altitudes."
18176,41,tennessee,18176,"In general, for areas outside the highest mountains, the average night hollows are close to freezing for most states."

18178,41,tennessee,18178," Although the state is far enough from the coast to avoid any direct impact of a hurricane, the state location makes it likely to be affected by remnants of tropical cyclones that weaken on land and can cause significant precipitation, such as tropical storm Chris in 1982 and hurricane Opal in 1995."
18179,41,tennessee,18179,"The average condition is about fifty days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large hail and harmful winds."
18180,41,tennessee,18180,"The tornadoes are possible throughout the state, the most vulnerable being Western and Middle Tennessee."
18181,41,tennessee,18181," Sometimes, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating tornadoes of April 2011 that killed twenty people in North Georgia and Southeast Tennessee."
18182,41,tennessee,18182,"On average, the state has 15 tornadoes per year."
18183,41,tennessee,18183,"The tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the nation into the percentage of total tornadoes that have died."
18184,41,tennessee,18184,"Winter storms are an occasional problem, such as the famous Blizzard of 1993, although ice storms are more likely."
18185,41,tennessee,18185,"Fog is a persistent problem in some parts of the state, particularly in Eastern Tennessee."
18186,41,tennessee,18186,"The capital and largest city are Nashville, although Knoxville, Kingston and Murfreesboro have all served as state capitals in the past."
18187,41,tennessee,18187,The metropolitan area of 13 counties of Nashville has been the largest in the state since early 1990.
18188,41,tennessee,18188,Memphis was the biggest city in the state until 2018 when it was overtaken by Nashville.
18189,41,tennessee,18189,"Chattanooga and Knoxville, both to the east near the Smoky Mountains, are about a third of this size."

18191,41,tennessee,18191,"Murfreesboro is the sixth town in Tennessee, with 146,900 inhabitants."
18192,41,tennessee,18192,"The area now known as Tennessee was inhabited for the first time by the Paleo-Indians almost 12,000 years ago."
18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between the first colony and the time of European contact were unknown, but several distinct cultural phases were named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC – 1000 BC) and Mississippi (1000–1600 BC), whose chiefs of staff were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who lived in the Tennessee Valley before the migration of Cherokee into the river waters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first European excursions recorded in what is now known as Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559 and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo has registered the name ""Tanasqui"" of a local Indian village, which has evolved to the current name of the state."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,At that time Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi.
18197,41,tennessee,18197," Perhaps because of devastating European diseases the Indian tribes, which would have left a vacuum of population, and also because of the expansion of the European colony in the north, the Cherokee moved south of the area now known as Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European settlers spread throughout the region, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all the Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw peoples, and finally the Cherokee peoples in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British colony in what is now Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near Vonore today."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,On that date Fort Loudoun became the westmost British outpost.
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard of Brahm and built by forces under British Captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202," After his completion, Captain Raymond Demeré abandoned command on 14 Aug. 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203,"War broke out between the British and the neighbour Overhill Cherokees, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with his surrender on 7 Aug. 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The next morning, Captain Paul Demeré and several of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of the eastern and middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began to arrive at the end of the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,"The majority of 18th-century settlers were English or mainly English, but almost 20% were also Scottish-Irish."
18207,41,tennessee,18207," These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on land leased to the Cherokee people."
18208,41,tennessee,18208," During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycomore Shoals (now Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his belligerent faction of Cherokee, who were aligned with the British loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209, These Cherokee renegades were designated by the colonists as Chickamauga.
18210,41,tennessee,18210, They opposed the annexation by North Carolina of the Washington District and the simultaneous establishment of the Transylvanian colony to the north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The life of many settlers was spared from the first war attacks by the warnings of Nancy Ward, cousin of Dragging Canoe."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The boundary fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a gathering place in 1780 for the men of Overmountain to make a voyage over the Appalachian Mountains, to engage and defeat the British army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213, Three counties in the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) left North Carolina in 1784 and formed Franklin State.
18214,41,tennessee,18214," Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (now eight) joined North Carolina in 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized in the southwestern territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In an effort to encourage settlers to move westward into the new territory, in 1787, the mother state of North Carolina ordered to cut off a road to take settlers to the Cumberland colonies – from the south end of Mount Clinch (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Avery Trace"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Wilderness Road"" through the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,Tennessee was admitted to the Union on 1 June 1796 as the 16th State.
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It was the first state created from a territory under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government.
18220,41,tennessee,18220," Apart from the 13 former colonies, only Vermont and Kentucky preceded the creation of Tennessee, and neither was ever a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, article I, section 31, stipulates that the starting point for the identification of the boundary is the extreme height of the stone mountain, at the point where the Virginia line intersects it, and leads essentially the extreme heights of the mountain ranges through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee after the Amerindian cities of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (mount Unicoi) to the southern boundary of the State; all the territory, lands and waters to the west of the said line are included within the limits and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also specified that the limits and jurisdiction of the State would include the future acquisition of land, reference to possible land exchanges with other States or the acquisition of territory west of Mississippi."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As other white settlers arrived in Tennessee, they entered into conflict with the Amerindian tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224," During the administration of U.S. President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."
18225,41,tennessee,18225,"American troops forced them to walk from ""emigration depots"" in eastern Tennessee, such as Fort Cass, to Indian territory further west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma."
18226,41,tennessee,18226," During this relocation, about 4,000 Cherokees died along the west road."
18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi, ""the path where we screamed""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Amerindians forced to emigrate as a result of the expulsion efforts of the Indians from the United States, so the expression ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indians, particularly among the ""Five Civilized Tribes""."
18229,41,tennessee,18229, This sentence arose from a description of the previous emigration of the Choctaw Nation.

18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution prohibits martial law within its jurisdiction.

18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee politics, like that of most American states, is dominated by republican and democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474," Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state until the period of the American civil war; for decades, a third east of the state was heavily republican and two thirds west voted mostly democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475," This division was linked to the State model in agriculture, plantations and slavery."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern part was made up of Yemeni farmers, but the middle and western Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton, which depended on slave labour."

18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of city commission government on the basis of a broad vote for a few positions in a committee council; several cities adopted this as another way of limiting African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,"In 1913, the State Parliament passed a bill allowing cities to adopt the structure without legislative approval."
18485,41,tennessee,18485," After the abandonment of the right to vote of the blacks, the Republican Party of Tennessee became a mainly white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, with the exception of two republican landslides at the national level of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee strongly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio governor James Cox, and in 1928, when he voted more resolutely for Herbert Hoover over New York governor Al Smith), the state was part of the solid democratic South until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In this post-war decade, he voted twice for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during the Second World War."

18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was not until after the mid-1960s and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new mechanisms, such as the Municipal Main Committee Governments, were adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491, Former Government.
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former U.S. senator Bill Brock won in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among the Whites for state-wide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493,Tennessee has chosen governors from various parties since 1970.
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"At the beginning of the 21st century, Republican voters controlled most of the state, especially in rural and suburban areas outside cities; the democratic force was mainly confined to the urban core of the four major cities, and was particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter includes a large African-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496," Historically, the Republicans had their greatest strength in Eastern Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"The 1st and 2nd districts of Tennessee, based respectively in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, are among the few republican historic districts of the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498,The inhabitants of these districts supported the Union over Confederation during the civil war.
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first one has been in Republican hands permanently since 1881, and the Republicans (or their predecessors) have held him for all but four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The second is permanently held by Republicans or their predecessors since 1859.

18502,41,tennessee,18502," Senator of Tennessee, did not bear his original state, an unusual event but revealing the strengthening of republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503," Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, with his margin of victory in the state rising from 4 per cent in 2000 to 14 per cent in 2004."

18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, approximately 30 per cent of the state electorate identified itself as independent."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"Baker v. Carr (1962) of the United States Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one voice"", requiring that state legislatures redistribute the distribution of Congress according to decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,He also demanded that both chambers of state legislatures be population-based to be represented rather than geographical districts such as counties.
18511,41,tennessee,18511, This case arose out of a legal action challenging the long-standing rural bias in the distribution of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512," After decades of under-representation of urban populations in many state legislatures, this important decision has led to increased (and proportional) importance in the policy of the State by cities and, ultimately, the suburbs, legislators and state officials in relation to their population within the State."
18513,41,tennessee,18513,"The decision also applied to many other states that had long been under the control of rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont and Montana."

18530,41,tennessee,18530," From 1913 to 1915 there was an interruption of executions, but they were restored in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531," From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (Furman v. Georgia) that capital punishment was unconstitutional, there were no other executions."
18532,41,tennessee,18532,"The death penalty was resumed in 1978, although prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 were mostly sentenced to life imprisonment."

18561,42,texas,18561," Because of its size and geological characteristics such as the Balcony fault, Texas is home to a variety of landscapes common to the southern and southwestern parts of the United States."
18562,42,texas,18562," Although Texas is largely associated with the deserts of the southwestern United States, less than ten percent of Texas's land is desert."

18569,42,texas,18569,In 1845 Texas joined the Union as the 28th state.
18570,42,texas,18570,The annexation of the State triggered a series of events that led to the war between Mexico and America in 1846.
18571,42,texas,18571,"A slave state before the American Civil War, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861 and officially joined the Confederate States of America on 2 March of that year."
18572,42,texas,18572," After the civil war and the restoration of his representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation."

18574,42,texas,18574," Before and after the American civil war, the bovine industry, which Texas dominated, was a major economic engine for the state, creating the traditional image of Texas's cowboy."
18575,42,texas,18575,"In the 19th century, cotton and softwood lumber became important industries as the livestock industry became less lucrative."
18576,42,texas,18576,"In the end, it was the discovery of large oil fields (Spindletop in particular) that triggered an economic boom that became the driving force of the economy for much of the twentieth century."

18582,42,texas,18582,"The name Texas, based on the word Caddo ""táysha"" (/t'aj) ""friend"", was applied, in the Tejas or Texas spelling, by the Spaniards to the Caddo themselves, in particular the Hasinai Confederation, the final -s representing the Spanish plural.The San Francisco de los Tejas Mission was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in May 1690, in what is now Houston County, in eastern Texas."
18583,42,texas,18583," During the Spanish colonial rule in the 18th century, the area was known as Nuevas Filipinas (""New Philippines"") and Nuevo Reino de Filipinas (""New Kingdom of the Philippines""), or Provincia de los Tejas (""Province of the Tejas""), later also Provincia de Texas (or Tejas), (""Province of Texas""), which was incorporated as Texas Provincia in the Mexican Empire in 1821, and declared republic in 1836."

18588,42,texas,18588,Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the southwest and the plains.
18589,42,texas,18589,Archaeologists found that three large indigenous cultures lived in this territory and reached their peak of development before the first European contact.
18590,42,texas,18590, These were:
18591,42,texas,18591," When the Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Aboriginal people divided into several smaller tribes."
18592,42,texas,18592," These included Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan and Uto-Aztecan."
18593,42,texas,18593,"The peoples of Uto-Aztecan Puebloan lived near Rio Grande in the western part of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mainly centered along the Gulf coast."
18594,42,texas,18594,"At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the Aranama, lived in southern Texas."
18595,42,texas,18595,"All this cultural group, mainly centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct."
18596,42,texas,18596,It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern part of the original state.
18597,42,texas,18597,"At the time when the region came to be explored, it belonged to the well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztécan people that had turned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century."
18598,42,texas,18598,"It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siwans."
18599,42,texas,18599," There was no dominant culture in the present Texas region, and many people lived there."
18600,42,texas,18600," Native American tribes living within the present boundaries of Texas include Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa and Wichita."
18601,42,texas,18601,"The name Texas derives from táysha, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, meaning ""friends"" or ""allies""."
18602,42,texas,18602,"The area was mainly controlled by the Spanish during the first two centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution."
18603,42,texas,18603," They were not particularly kind to their indigenous populations, let alone to the Caddoans, who had no confidence because their culture was shared between the Spanish and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604," When the Spaniards briefly succeeded in conquering the colony of Louisiana, they decided to change tactics and try to be extremely friends with the Indians, which they continued even after the French had taken over the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605, After the purchase of Louisiana in 1803 the United States inherited this strange circumstance.
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred American company and almost all their population migrated to the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spaniards felt swindled after spending so much time and effort and began to try to attract the Caddo, promising them even more land."
18608,42,texas,18608," Apparently, without knowing how they arrived, the United States (which had begun to convince the tribes to separate from the Whites by selling everything and moving west since they purchased Louisiana) faced an overflow of indigenous peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced populations to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609," They included Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, among others, who had all come to see the Caddoans as saviors, making them very influential."
18610,42,texas,18610,The question of whether an Amerindian tribe was friendly or warrior was crucial to the fate of European explorers and settlers on this land.
18611,42,texas,18611," Friendly tribes have taught newcomers to grow native crops, prepare food and hunt wild game."
18612,42,texas,18612,Warrior tribes have made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans by their attacks and resistance to new arrivals.
18613,42,texas,18613," During the Texas Revolution, the United States was heavily involved."
18614,42,texas,18614,Previous treaties with Spain prohibiting the two parties from militarizing its indigenous population in any potential conflict between the two nations.
18615,42,texas,18615,"At this time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans began to spread."
18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans have always been meaningless when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region have never been able to find any solid evidence linking them to it and often it was so far from Caddoan lands, it made little sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,"It seems very likely that these are false flag attacks aimed at triggering a cascade effect to force the indigenous people under Caddoan's influence to enter into an armed conflict without violating any treaty, preferably on the Spanish side."
18618,42,texas,18618," Although no evidence was found of the culprit's identity, Texas officials at the time repeatedly tried to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for incidents with the US government trying to keep them in check."
18619,42,texas,18619," Moreover, the Caddoans have never turned to violence because of this, with the exception of cases of self-defence."
18620,42,texas,18620,"In the 1830s, the United States had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the tears trail."
18621,42,texas,18621," Fearing the reward of other indigenous peoples, Indian agents throughout the eastern United States began desperately to try to convince all their indigenous peoples to uproot and move westward."
18622,42,texas,18622, They were the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18623,42,texas,18623," After the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their indigenous peoples, but did not honour the old land claims or agreements."
18624,42,texas,18624, This began the movement of indigenous peoples northward into what would become the modern Oklahoma Indian territory.
18625,42,texas,18625,"The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda."
18626,42,texas,18626," Nine years later, the shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first European of what is now Texas."
18627,42,texas,18627,"Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528, when the Spaniards landed in the area, ""half of the natives died of a bowel disease and blamed us""."
18628,42,texas,18628,Cabeza de Vaca also commented on the lifestyle of the Texas Native Ignatius:
18629,42,texas,18629,Francisco Vázquez de Coronado described his meeting in 1541:
18630,42,texas,18630,The European powers ignored the zone until they accidentally settled there in 1685.
18631,42,texas,18631,The calculation errors of René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle led to the establishment of the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River.
18632,42,texas,18632,The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to difficult conditions and hostile natives.
18633,42,texas,18633,"In 1690 the Spanish authorities, concerned that France was a competitive threat, built several missions in eastern Texas."
18634,42,texas,18634," After the Amerindian resistance, Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico."
18635,42,texas,18635," When France began to install Louisiana, mainly in the southern part of the state, in 1716, the Spanish authorities responded by creating a new series of missions in eastern Texas."
18636,42,texas,18636," Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian colony in the region."
18637,42,texas,18637,The hostile indigenous tribes and the distance of neighbouring Spanish settlements discouraged the settlers from settling in the area.
18638,42,texas,18638,It was one of the least populated provinces of New Spain.
18639,42,texas,18639,"In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Apaches of Lipan irritated many tribes, including the Comanches, Tonkawa and Hasinai."
18640,42,texas,18640,The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and then helped defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes.
18641,42,texas,18641," With the establishment of more missions, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes."
18642,42,texas,18642,"By the end of the 18th century, only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to Christianity."
18643,42,texas,18643," When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, the US authorities insisted that the agreement also included Texas."
18644,42,texas,18644,"The border between New Spain and the United States was finally fixed at the Sabine River in 1819, which is now the border between Texas and Louisiana."
18645,42,texas,18645,"Desirous of obtaining new land, many American settlers refused to recognize the agreement."
18646,42,texas,18646, Several filibusters have raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River.
18647,42,texas,18647,"In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence included the territory of Texas, which became part of Mexico."
18648,42,texas,18648," Due to its small population, Mexico has made the region part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas."
18649,42,texas,18649,"In hopes that more settlers will reduce Comanche's almost constant raids, Mexican Texas has liberalized its immigration policies to allow immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain."
18650,42,texas,18650," Under the Mexican immigration system, large tracts of land have been allocated to the empresarios, who recruit settlers from the United States, Europe and the interior of Mexico."
18651,42,texas,18651,"The first concession, to Moses Austin, was passed on to his son Stephen F. Austin after his death."
18652,42,texas,18652,"The settlers of Austin, the Three Hundred, made their way along the Brazos River in 1822."
18653,42,texas,18653," Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority of whom were from the United States."
18654,42,texas,18654,The population of Texas has grown rapidly.
18655,42,texas,18655,"By 1825 there were about 3,500 people in Texas, most of whom were of Mexican origin."
18656,42,texas,18656,"By 1834, the population had increased to about 37,800, with only 7,800 of Mexican origin."
18657,42,texas,18657," Most of those first settlers who arrived with Austin and shortly afterwards were less than lucky people in life, as Texas was devoid of the comforts found elsewhere in Mexico and the United States during this period."
18658,42,texas,18658,"The young settler of Texas, David B. Edwards, described his companions Texans as being ""banished from the pleasures of life."""
18659,42,texas,18659," Many immigrants have openly flouted Mexican law, particularly the prohibition of slavery."
18660,42,texas,18660,"In parallel with the attempts by the United States to purchase Texas, the Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to ban the continuation of immigration from the United States."
18661,42,texas,18661,"In any event, illegal immigration from the United States to Mexico continued to increase the population of Texas."

18663,42,texas,18663,"Anahuac's unrest in 1832 was the first open revolt against Mexican domination, and coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the president of the nation."
18664,42,texas,18664,The Texians opposed the federalists against the current government and chased all Mexican soldiers from eastern Texas.
18665,42,texas,18665, They took advantage of the lack of monitoring to act in favour of greater political freedom.

18668,42,texas,18668,"In Mexico, tensions between federalists and centralists have continued."
18669,42,texas,18669," Early in 1835, the wary Texians formed correspondence and security committees."
18670,42,texas,18670,The unrest broke out in the armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales.
18671,42,texas,18671," This launched the Texas Revolution, and over the next two months the Texians defeated all Mexican troops in the region."
18672,42,texas,18672,"The Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created an interim government."
18673,42,texas,18673,"The interim government quickly collapsed from the fighting, and Texas had no clear governance during the first two months of 1836."
18674,42,texas,18674," During this period of political unrest, Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna personally led an army to end the revolt."
18675,42,texas,18675,The Mexican expedition was first and foremost successful.

18684,42,texas,18684,"The Constitution of the Republic of Texas prohibits the government from restricting slavery or releasing slaves, and obliges people of free African descent to leave the country."

18686,42,texas,18686,"The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of Amerindians and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean."

18689,42,texas,18689," With broad popular support, Texas first asked for annexation to the United States in 1836, but its status as a slave country caused its admission to controversy and was initially rejected."
18690,42,texas,18690," This status, and Mexican diplomacy in support of its claims in the Territory, have also complicated Texas' ability to form foreign alliances and trade relations."

18824,42,texas,18824,"The oldest sediments were deposited on the sides of a torn continental margin, or passive margin that developed during the Cambrian."
18825,42,texas,18825, This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided into the Pennsylvania subperiod to form Pangea.
18826,42,texas,18826,It is the buried ridge of the Appalachian–Ouachita Mountains area of Pennsylvania's continental collision.
18827,42,texas,18827, This orogenous ridge is today buried under the Dallas–Waco–Austin–San Antonio trend.

18831,42,texas,18831," Today, 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediment is buried under the Texas continental shelf and much of the remaining U.S. oil reserves are here."
18832,42,texas,18832,"At the beginning of its formation, the nascent basin of the Gulf of Mexico was restricted and sea water often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of the Jurassic age."
18833,42,texas,18833, These salt deposits form salt domes and are located in eastern Texas along the Gulf Coast.
18834,42,texas,18834,Outcrops in eastern Texas consist of cretaceous and paleogenic sediments that contain significant eocene lignite deposits.
18835,42,texas,18835,"The sediments of Mississippi and Pennsylvania to the north; the Permian sediments to the west; and the Cretaceous sediments to the east, along the Gulf coast, and on the continental shelf of Texas contain oil."

18846,42,texas,18846,"The state Panhandle has cooler winters than northern Texas, while the Gulf coast has mild winters."
18847,42,texas,18847,Texas has wide variations in precipitation.
18848,42,texas,18848,"El Paso, at the western end of the state, has an average of 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual precipitation, while some parts of southeastern Texas have an average of 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year."

18851,42,texas,18851,Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only under rare circumstances.
18852,42,texas,18852,"Note the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm, where 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average temperature is 65°F in December."
18853,42,texas,18853," Maximum summer temperatures are on average 80°F (26°C) in the mountains of western Texas and Galveston Island at approximately 100°F (38°C) in the Rio Grande Valley, but most regions of Texas see constant high summer temperatures in the 90°F (32°C) range."
18854,42,texas,18854, Morning temperatures at night range from 50 °F (14 °C) in the western Texas mountains to 80 °F (27 °C) in Galveston.

18862,42,texas,18862,"A hurricane in 1875 killed approximately 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the city."
18863,42,texas,18863, These events allowed Galveston to take over as the main port city.
18864,42,texas,18864," Hurricane Galveston of 1900 then devastated the city, killing about 8,000 people, and even up to 12,000 people."
18865,42,texas,18865, That makes it the most deadly natural disaster in the history of the United States.
18866,42,texas,18866,"In 2017, Hurricane Harvey fell in Rockport as a Category 4 hurricane causing significant damage."
18867,42,texas,18867,"The storm lasted a long time, allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain on the Greater Houston area and surrounding counties."
18868,42,texas,18868, This has resulted in widespread and catastrophic floods that have flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.
18869,42,texas,18869,"Harvey eventually became the most costly hurricane in the world, causing damage estimated at $198.6 billion, exceeding the cost of Hurricane Katrina."

18873,42,texas,18873,"As an independent nation, Texas is the world's seventh largest producer of greenhouse gases."
18874,42,texas,18874,The causes of the government's large greenhouse gas emissions include the large number of state coal-fired power plants and government refining and manufacturing industries.

19393,43,utah,19393,It was an advantage for the local economy since the army sold everything in the camp for cents on the dollar before marching east to join the war.
19394,43,utah,19394,The territory was then left in the hands of LDS until Patrick E. Connor arrived with a regiment of Californian volunteers in 1862.

19450,43,utah,19450,Western Utah is primarily an arid desert with a basin and a range topography.
19451,43,utah,19451,Small mountain ranges and rough terrain punctuate the landscape.
19452,43,utah,19452,"The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being relatively flat because of once forming the bed of former Lake Bonneville."
19453,43,utah,19453,"Great Salt Lake, Lake Utah, Lake Sevier and Lake Rush are all remnants of this old freshwater lake that once covered most of the eastern Great Basin."

19482,43,utah,19482,"The main source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually on the road to major Pacific storms from October to May."
19483,43,utah,19483,"In summer, the state, particularly the south and east of Utah, is on the path to monsoon moisture from the Gulf of California."
19484,43,utah,19484," Most lowlands receive less than 12 inches (305 mm) of precipitation per year, although corridor I-15, including the densely populated Wasatch Front, receives approximately 15 inches (381 mm)."
19485,43,utah,19485,"The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest area of the state, with less than 5 inches (127 mm)."
19486,43,utah,19486,"Snowfalls are common in all valleys, with the exception of southern valleys."
19487,43,utah,19487," Although St. George receives only about 3 inches (76 mm) per year, Salt Lake City sees about 60 inches (1,524 mm), increased by effect snow Lake of Great Salt Lake, increasing total snowfall to the south, southeast and east of the lake."

19491,43,utah,19491,"The ever-deep snowfowl led the Utah ski industry to adopt the slogan ""The greatest snow on earth"" in the 1980s."
19492,43,utah,19492,"In winter, temperature inversions are a common phenomenon in Utah basins and valleys, resulting in thick fog and fog that can last for weeks at a time, especially in the Uintah basin."
19493,43,utah,19493," Although at other times of the year its air quality is good, winter reversals give Salt Lake City one of the worst winter pollution in the country."
19494,43,utah,19494,"Previous studies have shown a widespread decline in snow quantity above Utah, accompanied by a decline in the snow-precipitation ratio, while anecdotal claims have been made that the measured changes in Utah snow quantity are misleading and do not reflect actual changes."
19495,43,utah,19495,"A 2012 study found that the proportion of winter precipitation (January to March) that falls as snow has decreased by 9% over the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in precipitation and a slight decrease in snowfall."
19496,43,utah,19496," Meanwhile, the depth of snow observed in Utah decreased and was accompanied by a steady decrease in snow cover and surface albedo."
19497,43,utah,19497," Weather systems likely to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number, with those producing snowfall decreasing at a much higher rate."
19498,43,utah,19498,"Utah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation, and very hot summers on a state scale (except for mountain areas and high mountain valleys)."
19499,43,utah,19499,"Utah is usually protected from large explosions of cold air by mountains to the north and east of the state, although large arctic explosions may sometimes reach the state."
19500,43,utah,19500, Average January temperatures vary from about 30°F (−1°C) in some northern valleys to nearly 55°F (13°C) in St. George.
19501,43,utah,19501," Temperatures below 0°F (−18°C) should be expected occasionally in most parts of the state in most years, although some regions often see it (for example, the city of Randolph has an average of about fifty days a year with such low temperatures)."
19502,43,utah,19502,"In July, average heights range from about 85 to 100 °F (29 to 38 °C)."
19503,43,utah,19503," However, low humidity and high altitude usually result in large temperature variations, resulting in cool nights on most summer days."
19504,43,utah,19504,"The record temperature in Utah was 118°F (48°C), recorded south of St. George on July 4, 2007, and the low record was -69°F (−56°C), recorded at Peter Sinks in the Bear River Mountains in northern Utah on February 1, 1985."

19508,43,utah,19508," They are more likely to occur during the monsoon season, from mid-July to mid-September, especially in southern and eastern Utah."
19509,43,utah,19509," Dry lightning strikes and the general dry weather often triggers forest fires in the summer, while intense thunderstorms can cause flash floods, especially in the rugged southern Utah terrain."
19510,43,utah,19510," Although spring is the wettest season in northern Utah, late summer is the wettest time for much of the south and east of the state."
19511,43,utah,19511,"The tornadoes are uncommon in Utah, with an average of two hitting the state each year, rarely more intense than the EF1."
19512,43,utah,19512,"One exception, however, was the unprecedented F2 Salt Lake City Tornado, which moved directly to downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999, killing one person, wounding another sixty, and causing approximately $170 million in damage."
19513,43,utah,19513,"The only other deadly tornado reported in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on July 6, 1884."
19514,43,utah,19514,"The last tornado of intensity above (E)F0 occurred on September 8, 2002, when an F2 tornado hit Manti."

19844,44,vermont,19844," About 500 million years ago, the Vermont was part of Laurentia and was in the tropics."
19845,44,vermont,19845,"Green Mountain's central and southern range includes the oldest Vermont rocks, formed about a billion years ago during the first period of mountain (or orogeny) construction."
19846,44,vermont,19846," Subsequently, approximately 400 million years ago, the second period of mountain construction created Green Mountain peaks that ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 feet (4,600 to 6,100 m), three to four times their current height and were comparable to those of the Himalayas."
19847,44,vermont,19847,"The geological pressures that created these peaks remain evident as the Thrust Champlain, going from north to south to west of the mountains (now the east bank of Lake Champlain)."
19848,44,vermont,19848, This is an example of a geological fault surge where the bedrock is pushed on the formation of more recent rocks.

21063,46,washington,21063, Excerpted on 17 January 2021.
21064,46,washington,21064,"Frequent rain and cloud cover in western Washington is a major plot point in the popular Twilight book, which is located in western Washington precisely because of its relative lack of sun."
21065,46,washington,21065,"East Washington – the eastern part of the state of the Cascades – has a relatively dry climate, which contrasts sharply with the west side."
21066,46,washington,21066,It includes large semi-arid steppe areas and some really arid deserts in the rain shadow of the Cascades
21067,46,washington,21067," Despite limited rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important activity in most of eastern Washington, as the soil is very productive and irrigation, supported by dams along the Columbia River, is quite widespread."
21068,46,washington,21068,"Population growth in eastern Washington is dominated by access to water, particularly to rivers."
21069,46,washington,21069,"The major cities are all located next to rivers or lakes, most of which are named after the river or lake they adhere to."
21070,46,washington,21070,"More to the east, the climate becomes less arid, with annual precipitation increasing as it goes east to 21.2 inches (540 mm) at Pullman, near the Washington-Idaho border."
21071,46,washington,21071,The Okanogan Highlands and the rugged massif of Kettle River and the Selkirk Mountains cover much of the northeast quadrant of the state.
21072,46,washington,21072,The Palous area south-east of Washington was a meadow that was primarily converted to agricultural land and extends to the blue mountains.
21073,46,washington,21073,"As discussed above, Washington's climate varies considerably from west to east."
21074,46,washington,21074,"A Mediterranean climate predominates in western Washington, and a much drier semi-arid climate prevails east of the Cascade Range."
21075,46,washington,21075,"Major factors that determine Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent high-pressure and low-pressure systems in the northern Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In the spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the northern Pacific Ocean, causing a clockwise spiral of air."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means that prevailing northwestern winds bring relatively cool air and a predictable dry season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In autumn and winter, a system of low-pressure cyclones takes over in the northern Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,"The inward spiral air in the opposite direction of the clockwise makes the prevailing winds of Washington come from the southwest, and brings relatively warm and humid air masses and a predictable wet season."
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is commonly used to describe atmospheric fluvial events, where repeated storm systems are driven by this persistent cyclone in tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions in the Pacific Northwest."
21081,46,washington,21081," Although the west of Washington has a marine climate similar to many coastal cities in Europe, there are exceptions such as the ""Big Snow"" events of 1880, 1881, 1893 and 1916, and the ""Deep Freezing"" winters of 1883–84, 1915–1916, 1949–1950 and 1955–1956, among others."
21082,46,washington,21082," During these events, western Washington experienced up to 1.8 metres of snow, subzero temperatures (−18 °C), three months of snow on the ground, and frozen lakes and rivers for weeks."
21083,46,washington,21083,"The lowest officially recorded temperature in Seattle is 0°F (−18°C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-lying areas at about three hours from Seattle recorded lows as cold as −48°F (−44°C)."
21084,46,washington,21084,South oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085," During the El Niño phase, the jet enters the United States further south through California, so late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snow."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet in the northwest Pacific, so Washington has more rain and snow than the average."
21087,46,washington,21087,"In 2006, the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group published The Impacts of Climate Change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities presented in view of the potential for rising global temperatures and their effects on Washington's state."
21088,46,washington,21088, Precipitation in Washington varies significantly from east to west.
21089,46,washington,21089,"The western part of the Olympic Peninsula receives up to 160 inches (4,100 mm) of precipitation each year, making it the wettest area of the 48 neighbouring states and a temperate rainforest."
21090,46,washington,21090,Weeks can go by without a clear day.
21091,46,washington,21091,"The west slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the largest annual snowfalls (in some places more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres of water equivalent) across the country."
21092,46,washington,21092,"In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093, Precipitation then increases eastward towards the Rocky Mountains (approximately 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and waterfalls aggravate this climate pattern by causing an orographical uplift of blowing air masses inside the Pacific Ocean, resulting in high levels of precipitation on the wind side of the mountains and low levels on the left side."
21095,46,washington,21095, This happens most dramatically around the Olympic mountains and the Cascade chain.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases, wind-oriented slopes to the southwest receive high precipitation and mild and cool temperatures."
21097,46,washington,21097," Although the Puget Sound lowlands are known for cloud and rain in winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher altitudes."
21098,46,washington,21098,"Mount Baker, near the northern border of the state, is one of the most snowy areas in the world."
21099,46,washington,21099,"In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season: 1,140 inches (95 ft.; 29 m.)."
21100,46,washington,21100,"To the east of the Cascades, a large area experiences strong rain shadow effects."
21101,46,washington,21101," Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington, with the strongest effects of rain shadow at relatively low elevations on the central Columbia Plateau, especially in the area just east of the Columbia River, from the Snake River to the Okanagan Highlands."
21102,46,washington,21102," Thus, instead of rainforests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry grasslands, shrub steppe and sand dunes."
21103,46,washington,21103,The mean annual temperature ranges from 51°F (11°C) on the Pacific coast to 40°F (4°C) in the northeast.
21104,46,washington,21104,The lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48 °F (−44 °C) in Winthrop and Mazama.
21105,46,washington,21105,The highest temperature recorded in the state was 118°F (48°C) at the ice harbour dam.
21106,46,washington,21106, Both records were set east of the Cascades.
21107,46,washington,21107,"Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, long winter drizzles and warm and temperate summers."
21108,46,washington,21108,"The Eastern region, which does not enjoy the general moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean, sometimes experiences an extreme climate."
21109,46,washington,21109, Cold Arctic fronts in winter and heat waves in summer are not rare.
21110,46,washington,21110, Temperatures in the western region were only 107°F (42°C) in Centralia and up to −6°F (−21°C) in Longview.
21111,46,washington,21111," Forests cover about half of the state's land area, mainly west of the Northern Cascades."
21112,46,washington,21112," Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forest area is owned by the state, 64% of which is federal land."
21113,46,washington,21113,"Common trees and plants in the area are camassia, Douglas-fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many ferns."
21114,46,washington,21114,"The various wild areas of the state offer a sanctuary, with large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals."
21115,46,washington,21115,"The Pacific coast surrounding the San Juan Islands is heavily populated by white-headed, grey and humpback whales."

21470,47,west_virginia,21470,"The tribes that inhabited Western Virginia from 1600 onward were the Siouan Monongahela culture in the north, the Fort Antique culture along the Ohio River from Monongahela to Kentucky and the extension of an unknown inland distance, and the Siouan Tutelo and Moneton tribes from the east in the southeast."
21471,47,west_virginia,21471," There was also the Iroquoian Susquehannock in the area approximately east of the Monongahela River and north of the Monongahela National Forest, a possible tribe called the Senatorndoa, or Shenandoah, in the Shenandoah Valley and the easternmost point of the state may have been home to the Manahoac people."

21489,47,west_virginia,21489," They became known as Shattaras, or West Virginia Cherokees."
21490,47,west_virginia,21490," They took and merged with the Monetons, who began to name themselves as the Mohetons."
21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicua also began to designate themselves as Cherokees shortly afterwards, showing an apparent additional fusion."
21492,47,west_virginia,21492," These Shattaras were closely linked to the tribes that formed in the south following the Westo, the Yuchi and Cherokee."

21495,47,west_virginia,21495," Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, it would mean the collapse of the Shattara-Moneton culture."
21496,47,west_virginia,21496," Another tribe that appeared in the area was the Canaragay, or Kanawha."

21515,47,west_virginia,21515,"In 1776, however, the Shawnee were back at war, joining the Chickamauga, a band of Cherokee known for the area where they lived."

21517,47,west_virginia,21517," During the war, settlers from western Virginia were usually active Whigs and many served in the continental army."
21518,47,west_virginia,21518," However, the Claypool rebellion of 1780–81, in which a group of men refused to pay the taxes imposed by the Continental Army, demonstrated the tenacity of the war in what became Western Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,The social conditions in western Virginia were quite different from those in the eastern part of the state.
21520,47,west_virginia,21520,"The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable portion of immigration came through Pennsylvania and included Germans, Protestant Scots-Irishes and settlers from more northerly states."
21521,47,west_virginia,21521,The eastern and southern counties were established mainly by the eastern Virginians.
21522,47,west_virginia,21522," During the American Revolution, the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was submitted to Congress, on the grounds that the mountains had a barrier almost impassable to the east."
21523,47,west_virginia,21523,"The wilderness of the country made slavery unprofitable, and time only increased the social, political, economic and cultural differences (see Tuckahoe-Cohee) between the two sections of Virginia."

21526,47,west_virginia,21526," However, Western reforms have been rejected by the leaders of the Eastern Alleghenies who ""dive into political power in an effort to preserve their way of plantation dependent on black slavery""."
21527,47,west_virginia,21527, Virginia's leaders maintained a property qualification to effectively deny the right to vote to poor farmers in the West whose families were engaged in much of the agricultural work themselves.
21528,47,west_virginia,21528,"In addition, the 1829–30 convention granted slave counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population by allocating state representation in the United States House of Representatives."
21529,47,west_virginia,21529,"As a result, all but one of the counties west of the Alleghenies voted to reject the constitution, which was nonetheless adopted because of the support of the East."
21530,47,west_virginia,21530,The inability of the Eastern planter elite to carry out constitutional reforms exacerbated the existing East-West sectarianism in Virginia and contributed to the subsequent division of Virginia.

21537,47,west_virginia,21537," This was made acceptable to the West by a provision which required the General Assembly to resume representation on the basis of the white population in 1865, or to refer the matter to a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the East has also given itself a tax advantage by requiring a real and real property tax, with the exception of slaves."
21539,47,west_virginia,21539," Slaves under the age of 12 are not taxed and slaves over the age of 12 are taxed at only $300, a fraction of their real value."
21540,47,west_virginia,21540," However, small-scale farmers had all their property, animals and taxed land at full value."
21541,47,west_virginia,21541," Despite this tax and the absence of internal improvements in the West, the vote was 75,748 in favour and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542," Most of the opposition came from delegates from Eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the West."
21543,47,west_virginia,21543,"In view of these differences, many in the West had long considered a separate state."
21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men like lawyer Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont had long fought under the political domination of the slaves of Tidewater and Piedmont."
21545,47,west_virginia,21545,"In addition to the differences on the abolition of slavery, he and his allies felt the government of Virginia ignored and refused to spend money on the necessary internal improvements in the West, such as spindles and railways."
21546,47,west_virginia,21546,West Virginia was the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate State (Virginia) during the American Civil War.
21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the 1861 Virginia Secession Agreement voted for the secession of the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwest corner (who eventually became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favour of the secession order, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548," Almost immediately after this vote, a mass meeting in Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to an assembly to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"At the first meeting, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, but more than a third of the delegates were from the North Panhandle region."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550," Soon, there was a division of feelings."
21551,47,west_virginia,21551," Some delegates led by John S. Carlile favoured the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been adopted by the required referendum (as happened on 23 May), such action would constitute a revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if the Virginians adopted the secession order (of which there was no doubt), another convention comprising the elected members of the legislature would meet at Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On 23 May 1861 the secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the order."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on 11 June and stated that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its actions were null and void and all those who had acceded to it had left their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never really elected by public ballot to act on behalf of Western Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of its 103 members, 33 were elected to the Virginia General Assembly on 23 May."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557," These included United States senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and others who had left their offices to meet at Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558," Other members ""were chosen in an even more irregular way – some at mass meetings, others by county committee, and still others were apparently appointed by themselves""."
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,A law on the reorganization of the government was adopted on 19 June.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The delegates of the next day's assembly chose Francis H. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, and elected other officers from a rival state government and two American senators (Willy and Carlile) to replace the secessionists before adjourning."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,"The Washington federal government, D.C., quickly recognized the new government and sat on the two new senators."
21562,47,west_virginia,21562," Thus, there were two state governments in Virginia: one promising allegiance to the United States and the other to confederation."
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The Second Wheeling Convention had been suspended until 6 August, then met on 20 August and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new State and a convention to govern a constitution if the vote were to be favourable."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"In the elections of 24 October 1861, 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The results of the elections were questioned, as the Union army occupying the area and the Union troops were stationed in numerous polls to prevent the Confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"It was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in confederate soldiers' camps, which elected rival state officials such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567, Most pro-state votes came from 16 counties around the North Panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"More than 50,000 votes were cast on the secession order, but the vote on State status did not exceed 19,000 votes."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, home to Wheeling, only a quarter of registered voters voted."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote at all, since two-thirds of West Virginia's territory had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,Votes in the counties favouring secession were most often cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572," Despite this controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to draft a new Constitution for the new State, beginning on 26 November 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573," During this constitutional convention, one Mr Lamb from Ohio County and one Mr Carskadon claimed that, in Hampshire County, out of only 195 votes, 39 were issued by state citizens; the others were illegally launched by Union soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One key figure was Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools, as well as to limit the movement of slaves to the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The education proposal was successful, but the convention tabled the proposals for slavery before completing its work on February 18, 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution is more inspired by Ohio than Virginia, adopting a cantonal government model rather than Virginia's ""courthouse clicks"" than Carlile criticizes, and a compromise required by the Kanawha region (lawyers Charleston Benjamin Smith and Brown) allows counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railways or other improvement agencies."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578,"The resulting instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on 11 April 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,"On May 13, 1862, the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state."
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,A request for admission to the Union was made to Congress by Senator Waitman Willey of the re-established Virginia government.
21581,47,west_virginia,21581," However, Senator Carlile sought to sabotage the bill by first trying to widen the boundaries of the new state to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then defeating the Willey amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling law was approved by President Abraham Lincoln who admitted West Virginia, provided that a provision for the progressive abolition of slavery was included in its constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle had exhorted in the Wheeling Intelligence and also wrote to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584," While many felt that the admission of West Virginia as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln expressed his opinion on the admission of West Virginia by concluding that ""the organ that consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Legislative Assembly of Virginia"", and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and timely."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,"The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the request for the abolition of the federal enabling law was met."
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,"The revised Constitution was adopted on 26 March 1863 and on 20 April 1863 President Lincoln issued a proclamation in which he admitted the State 60 days later, on 20 June 1863."
21587,47,west_virginia,21587," Meanwhile, officers for the new state were chosen, while Gov."
21588,47,west_virginia,21588,"Pierpont moved his pro-Union capital Virginia to Alexandria occupied by the Union, where he affirmed and exercised jurisdiction over all the other counties of Virginia within the federal lines."
21589,47,west_virginia,21589,The constitutionality of the formation of the new state was then referred to the Supreme Court of the United States in Virginia v. West Virginia.
21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties, located on the Potomac to the east of the mountains, in 1863, with the consent of the reorganized Virginia government, voted in favour of annexation to Western Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591, Many voters in counties strongly in favour of secessionists were absent from the Confederate Army at the time of the vote and refused to recognize the transfer upon their return.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly repealed the act of secession and, in 1866, brought an action against West Virginia asking the court to declare the counties part of Virginia, which would have declared the admission of West Virginia as an unconstitutional state."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593," Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress adopted a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Western Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595," During the civil war, General Union forces George B. McClellan took possession of most of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating in the Battle of Rich Mountain, and control of the Union was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863 General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 confederates, raided a large part of the state and burned the Pierpont library, although Senator Willey escaped their control."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,"Bands of guerrillas burned and looted in some sections, and were not completely eliminated until after the end of the war."
21598,47,west_virginia,21598, Eastern Panhandle counties have been more affected by the war as military control of the area has changed hands several times.
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The region that became West Virginia has indeed provided about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, about 22,000 to 25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to remove the voting rights of the Confederates' return in order to maintain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said that if it were not enacted, it would lose the election by 500 votes."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of the confederates could also be confiscated and, in 1866, a constitutional amendment depriving all those who had helped and comforted the confederation was adopted."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution caused a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,"The Democratic Party gained control in 1870, and in 1871 the constitutional amendment of 1866 was repealed."
21605,47,west_virginia,21605,"The first steps towards this change had, however, been taken by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,On 22 August 1872 a new constitution was adopted.
21607,47,west_virginia,21607," From the reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states challenged the state's share of the debts of the pre-war government of Virginia, which had been primarily committed to financing the improvement of public infrastructure, such as canals, roads and railways, under the leadership of the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,"The Virginians, led by former confederate general William Mahone, formed a political coalition based on this: the Readjuster Party."
21609,47,west_virginia,21609," Although the first constitution of West Virginia provided for the acceptance of a portion of Virginia's debt, the negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were unsuccessful and, in 1871, Virginia financed two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily attributed the rest to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally resolved in 1915, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The last instalment of this sum was paid in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612," Following the reconstruction, the new 35th State benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613," Saltpeter caves were used throughout Appalachia to manufacture ammunition; the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the Saltpeter Trail, a chain of limestone caves containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were returned and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail extends from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the road in the city of Union, in Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615," Nearly half of these caves are on the west side of Virginia, including the organ cave and the Haynes cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"In the late 18th century, Haynes Cave saltpeter miners found large animal bones in the deposits."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617," They were sent by a local historian and border soldier, Colonel John Stuart, to Thomas Jefferson."
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were called Megalonyx jeffersonii, or big claw, and became known as Jefferson's three-finger sloth."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,He was declared an official fossil of the state of West Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The official rock of the state of West Virginia is the bituminous coal, and the official gemstone of the state is silicified fossil of the Mississippi Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621," Limestone has also produced a useful, generally small, quarry industry and softer, high-calcium seams have been burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622," This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years, a specific portion of the C & O railway transported limestone to Clifton Forge, Virginia, as an industrial stream."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"The extraction of salt had been under way since the 18th century, although it played largely in the era of the American civil war, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valuable commodity of the first Confederate forces and then of the Union."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In the years that followed, more sophisticated extraction methods would restore the role of West Virginia as the main salt producer."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625," However, in the second half of the 19th century there was an even larger treasure that was not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626,It would fuel much of the industrial revolution in the United States and the steam ships of many of the world's marines.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627, Residents (indigenous and early European settlers) had long known the underlying coal and could use it for heating and fuel.
21628,47,west_virginia,21628,"For a long time, however, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629," After the war, with the new railways came a practical method of transporting large quantities of coal to the expansion of US and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630,"As the anthracite mines in northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began playing during the same period, investors and industrialists focused their interest on Western Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted studied potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) Railway across the state to the new town of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River coalfield.
21633,47,west_virginia,21633," Soon, the C&O was building its huge coal wharf at Newport News, Virginia, on the large harbour of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new owners of the former Atlantic Railway, Mississippi and Ohio (AM&O), which extended across southern Virginia from Norfolk, had clear views of the state of the mountains, where the owners had extensive lands."
21635,47,west_virginia,21635," Their railway was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railway city was developed in Roanoke to manage the planned expansion."
21636,47,west_virginia,21636," After his new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party travelled on horseback and first-hand saw the rich bituminous seam of coal, which Kimball's wife named Pocahontas, the N&W reoriented his expansion project to the west to reach him."
21637,47,west_virginia,21637," Soon, the N&W also sailed from new coal jetties at Hampton Roads."
21638,47,west_virginia,21638,"In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and western railway lines, the important coal centre of Bluefield, West Virginia, was founded."
21639,47,west_virginia,21639,"The capital of the Pocahontas coalfield, this town would remain the largest city in the southern part of the state for several decades."
21640,47,west_virginia,21640,"She shares a sister city of the same name, Bluefield, Virginia."
21641,47,west_virginia,21641,"In the northern part of the state and elsewhere, the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities."
21642,47,west_virginia,21642,The B&O developed coal jetties in Baltimore and several locations on the Great Lakes.
21643,47,west_virginia,21643," Other major coal railways were the Western Maryland Railway (WM), Southern Railway (SOU) and the Louisville and Nashville Railway (L&N)."
21644,47,west_virginia,21644,"A delayer, the Virginian Railway (VGN), was particularly notable."
21645,47,west_virginia,21645,"By 1900, only the most rugged terrain in southwestern Virginia was at any distance from existing railways and mining activities."
21646,47,west_virginia,21646,"In this area west of the New River coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties, the Winding Gulf coalfield was later promoted as the ""Billion Dollar Coalfield""."
21647,47,west_virginia,21647,"Ansted's protégé was William Nelson Page (1854–1932), a civil engineer and mining director in Fayette County."
21648,47,west_virginia,21648," Former West Virginia governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land ""as a farmer knows a field."""
21649,47,west_virginia,21649," From 1898, Page teamed up with investors from the North and Europe to take advantage of the undeveloped zone."
21650,47,west_virginia,21650," They acquired extensive land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short line of railway chartered to stretch between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka — a distance of approximately 80 miles (130 km)."
21651,47,west_virginia,21651," Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive marine transportation contract by either railway, the managers of the two major railways did not appreciate the plan."
21652,47,west_virginia,21652,"In secret collusion, everyone refused to negotiate favorable rates with Page, and they did not offer to buy their railway, as they had many other short lines."
21653,47,west_virginia,21653," However, if the presidents of the C&O and N&W thought they could kill the Page project, they had to be wrong."
21654,47,west_virginia,21654,"One of Page's silent investor-partners was the million-dollar industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a director of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, and a former manager of natural resource development and transportation."
21655,47,west_virginia,21655,"Master in competitive ""war,"" Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his efforts and also had ""deep pockets."""
21656,47,west_virginia,21656," Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks throughout Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost."
21657,47,west_virginia,21657," When the Virginian Railway (VGN) was completed in 1909, no fewer than three railways shipped ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads."
21658,47,west_virginia,21658,West Virginia coal was also widely used in Great Lakes harbours.
21659,47,west_virginia,21659,"The NGV and N&W have finally become parts of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the well-developed 21st century NGV lanes continue to provide a favourable gradient for Hampton roads."
21660,47,west_virginia,21660,"As coal mining and related work became important employment activities in the State, working conditions, safety issues and economic concerns arose."
21661,47,west_virginia,21661," Even in the twenty-first century, mining safety and environmental concerns continue to pose problems for the State whose coal continues to supply power plants in many other states."
21662,47,west_virginia,21662," Coal is not the only precious mineral found in West Virginia, since the state was the site of the discovery in 1928 of the 34.48 carat Jones diamond (6.896 g)."
21663,47,west_virginia,21663," Located in the Appalachian Range, West Virginia covers an area of 62,754.8 km2, with 62,361.0 km2 of land and 393.8 km2 of water, making it the 41st state of the United States."
21664,47,west_virginia,21664,"West Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest, and Kentucky in the southwest."
21665,47,west_virginia,21665," Its longest border is with Virginia 381 miles (613 km), followed by Ohio 243 miles (391 km), Maryland 174 miles (280 km), Pennsylvania 118 miles (190 km), and Kentucky 79 miles (127 km)."
21666,47,west_virginia,21666,"West Virginia is entirely located in the Appalachian region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi (""The mounttains are always free"")."
21667,47,west_virginia,21667, Heights and robustness fall close to large rivers such as the Ohio River or the Shenandoah River.
21668,47,west_virginia,21668, About 75% of the state is located in the Cumberland Plateau and the Allegheny Plateau regions.
21669,47,west_virginia,21669," Although the terrain is not high, the plateau area is extremely rugged in most regions."
21670,47,west_virginia,21670,"The average altitude of West Virginia is about 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, the highest of all American states east of Mississippi."
21671,47,west_virginia,21671,"On the eastern line of the state with Virginia, high peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region result in an island of cooler climate and ecosystems similar to those in northern New England and eastern Canada."
21672,47,west_virginia,21672,"The highest point in the state is the top of Spruce Knob, at 1863 feet (1,482 m), and is covered in dense spruce boreal forest at altitudes greater than 4,000 feet (1,200 m)."
21673,47,west_virginia,21673, Spruce Knob is located in the Monongahela National Forest and is part of Spruce Knob-Senatorca Rocks National Recreation Area.
21674,47,west_virginia,21674,"In total, six wild areas are also found in the forest."
21675,47,west_virginia,21675," Outside the forest to the south, the gorge of the New River is a 300 metre deep canyon carved by the New River."
21676,47,west_virginia,21676,The National Parks Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the National Park and Gorge Reserve of the new river.
21677,47,west_virginia,21677, Other areas that are protected and managed include:
21678,47,west_virginia,21678," Most of Western Virginia is located in the mixed Mesophyte Appalachian ecoregion, while high elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie in the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests."
21679,47,west_virginia,21679,"The native vegetation of most of the state was originally a mixed forest of hardwood oak, chestnut, maple, beech, and white pine, with American willow and sycamore along the rivers of the state."
21680,47,west_virginia,21680," Many of these areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact appreciated by the Western Virginians, who refer to their home as almost heaven (from John Denver's song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"")."
21681,47,west_virginia,21681," Before the song, he was known as ""The Cog State"" (coal, oil and gas) or ""The Mountain State""."
21682,47,west_virginia,21682,"The underlying rock strata are sandstone, shale, bituminous coal deposits, and limestone placed in an environment close to the coast from sediments derived from the mountains to the east in a shallow inland sea to the west."
21683,47,west_virginia,21683," Some beds illustrate coastal marshland, river delta, shallow waters."
21684,47,west_virginia,21684,"Sea levels rose and fell several times during the Mississippi and Pennsylvania eras, giving a variety of rocky strata."
21685,47,west_virginia,21685,"The Appalachians are among the oldest on earth, having formed more than three hundred million years ago."
21686,47,west_virginia,21686,"West Virginia's climate is generally a humid subtropical climate (classification of the climate of Köppen Cfa, with the exception of Dfb at higher altitudes) with warm to warm, humid and cold winters, increasing in severity with altitude."
21687,47,west_virginia,21687, Some regions of the southern highlands also have a temperate mountain climate (Köppen Cfb) where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are slightly cooler.
21688,47,west_virginia,21688," However, time is subject to change in all parts of the state."
21689,47,west_virginia,21689,Hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the Central Appalachian Mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest elevations.
21690,47,west_virginia,21690,"In the Eastern Panhandle and Ohio Valley, temperatures are warm enough to see and cultivate subtropical plants such as Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Myrtle Crepe, Albizia julibrissin, American sweetgum and even needle palm and minor sabal."
21691,47,west_virginia,21691, These plants don't thrive as well in other parts of the state.

21698,47,west_virginia,21698,The eastern valleys are less rainy because the mountain ridges of Allegheny in the west create a partial rain shadow.
21699,47,west_virginia,21699, Just over half of the precipitation occurs between April and September.
21700,47,west_virginia,21700,"Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section, especially in the Tygart Valley."

21702,47,west_virginia,21702,"In addition to the persistent cloudy sky caused by the degradation of humidity by the Alleghenies, West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation, with snowshoes on average nearly 200 days a year with rain or snow."
21703,47,west_virginia,21703,"Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections, but may persist for weeks in the upper mountainous areas."
21704,47,west_virginia,21704,"On average, 34 inches (860 mm) of snow fall each year in Charleston, although in the winter of 1995-96, more than three times that amount declined, with several cities in the state setting new snowfall records."

21706,47,west_virginia,21706,"Violent weather is a little less common in West Virginia than in most other eastern states, and it ranks among the least tornado-like states east of the Rocky Mountains."
21707,47,west_virginia,21707,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of West Virginia was 1,792,147 on July 1, 2018, a 3.28 per cent decrease from the 2010 U.S. Census."
