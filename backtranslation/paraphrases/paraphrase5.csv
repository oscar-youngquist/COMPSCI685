122,0,alabama,122,"The continuation of racial discrimination and lynching, the agricultural depression and the failure of cotton crops due to the infestation of ploughs has led tens of thousands of African-Americans from rural areas of Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in the cities of the north and west in the first decades of the twentieth century as part of the Great Migration out of the South."
123,0,alabama,123,"In view of this emigration, the rate of population growth in Alabama (see the table ""historical populations"" below) fell by almost half between 1910 and 1920."

134,0,alabama,134, Cotton and other commercial crops have become less important as the State has developed a production and service base.
135,0,alabama,135," Despite the massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the predominantly rural legislature refused to renew the seats of the House and Senators according to the population, as required by the constitution of the State in order to follow the results of the decennial censuses."
136,0,alabama,136, They held an old representation to maintain political and economic power in the agricultural areas.
137,0,alabama,137,"As a result, Jefferson County, home to Birmingham's industrial and economic power, paid more than a third of all tax revenues to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests are still underrepresented in Parliament.
139,0,alabama,139,"A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, ""a minority of about 25 per cent of the total population of the State is under the majority control of the Alabama Legislative Assembly""."
140,0,alabama,140,"In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the United States Supreme Court held that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" should be the basis of both chambers of state legislatures and that their districts should be based on population rather than geographic counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, Parliament completed the redistribution of Congress on the basis of the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142," This has benefited the urban areas that have developed, as well as the entire population that has been underrepresented for more than sixty years."
143,0,alabama,143, Further changes have been made to the establishment of the representative State House and Senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144," African-Americans continued to lobby in the 1950s and 1960s to end exclusion and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools should be disaggregated, but Alabama delayed compliance."
146,0,alabama,146," During the 1960s, under the leadership of Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted federal requirements for desegregation."
147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement experienced remarkable events in Alabama, including the boycott of the Montgomery buses (1955-1956), the Freeway Rides in 1961 and the Selma Marches in Montgomery in 1965."
148,0,alabama,148, They contributed to the adoption and promulgation by the U.S. Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
149,0,alabama,149," Legal segregation in the states ended in 1964, but Jim Crow's customs often continued until they were expressly challenged in court."
150,0,alabama,150," According to the New York Times, in 2017, many Afro-Americans in Alabama lived in the cities of Alabama such as Birmingham and Montgomery."
151,0,alabama,151,"In addition, the black belt area of central Alabama ""is home to largely poor counties that are mainly African-American."
152,0,alabama,152," These counties are Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made some changes since the end of the twentieth century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus case of redistriction, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the general vote for seats representing 180 Alabama courts, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155," Voting in general has diluted the votes of a minority in a county, with the majority tending to take all seats."
156,0,alabama,156," Although African-Americans are an important minority in the state, they have not been able to elect representatives in most jurisdictions in general."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of the settlement of this case, five cities and counties of Alabama, including Chilton County, have adopted a cumulative voting system for the election of representatives in multiple-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158, This has led to an increase in proportional representation of voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 administrations use limited voting, as in Conecuh County."
160,0,alabama,160,"In 1982, a limited vote was tested for the first time in Conecuh County."
161,0,alabama,161," Together, the use of these systems has increased the number of African-American women and women elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens."
162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth state of the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of the total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making the Alabama 23rd in quantity of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway network in the United States."

176,0,alabama,176,A 300-metre-wide meteorite hit the region about 80 million years ago.
177,0,alabama,177,"The hills just east of Wetumpka city centre show the eroded remains of the impact crater that was projected into the rocky substrate, with the area marked by the crater or the Wetumpka astroblem (""star-wound"") due to the concentric rings of fractures and broken rock areas that can be found beneath the surface."

347,0,alabama,347,"The founding document of the government of Alabama is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901."
348,0,alabama,348," With nearly 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is, according to some, the longest constitution in the world and represents about 40 times the duration of the United States Constitution."
349,0,alabama,349, There has been an important movement to rewrite and modernize the Alabama constitution.
350,0,alabama,350," Critics argue that the constitution of Alabama maintains a highly centralized power with the legislative power of the state, leaving virtually no power in local hands."
351,0,alabama,351, Most counties don't have the home rule.
352,0,alabama,352," Any proposed policy change in the various areas of the State must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, often, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353,A critique of the current constitution asserts that its complexity and length intentionally codifies segregation and racism.
354,0,alabama,354,The government of Alabama is divided into three coequal branches.
355,0,alabama,355," Legislative power is the Legislative Assembly of Alabama, a bicameral assembly composed of the House of Representatives of Alabama, composed of 105 members, and the Senator of Alabama, composed of 35 members."
356,0,alabama,356,"The Legislature is responsible for writing, discussing, adopting or rejecting the laws of the State."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature.
358,0,alabama,358,The Legislature has the power to derogate from a right of veto by a simple majority (most state legislatures need a two-thirds majority in order to derogate from a right of veto).
359,0,alabama,359," Until 1964, the state elected Senators of State on a geographical basis per county, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360," Since the adoption of its constitution in 1901, it has not redistributed Congressional constituencies; as a result, urbanized areas are largely underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,Nor has it changed the legislative districts to reflect the 10-year censuses.
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one voice"", ruling that Congressional districts should be recomposed on the basis of censuses (as the state had already included in its constitution but had not done)."
363,0,alabama,363,"In addition, the Court decided that the two chambers of the legislatures of bicameral States should be distributed by population, as there was no constitutional basis for States to have geographical systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other States had to change their legislative districts, as many countries had systems that were underrepresented in urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365, This has led to decades of under-investment in these areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For example, taxes in Birmingham and Jefferson County provided one third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of the state's funding."
367,0,alabama,367," Through legislative delegations, the Alabama Legislative Assembly has maintained control of county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive branch is responsible for the enforcement and oversight of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is headed by the Governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370," Other members of the Executive include the Cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, the Attorney-General of Alabama, the Secretary of State of Alabama, the Treasurer of Alabama State and the Auditor of Alabama."
371,0,alabama,371,The present governor is Republican Kay Ivey.

374,0,alabama,374,The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of the State and applying the law in the criminal and civil cases of the State.
375,0,alabama,375,The Supreme Court of Alabama is the highest court in the state.
376,0,alabama,376,Alabama uses partisan elections to choose judges.
377,0,alabama,377," Since the 1980s, judicial campaigns have become more and more politicized."
378,0,alabama,378,The current Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All judges of the Supreme Court of Alabama are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380," There are two intermediate courts of appeal, the Civil Court of Appeal and the Criminal Court of Appeal, and four courts of first instance: the Circuit Court (court of first instance under general jurisdiction) and the District, Provincial and Municipal Courts."
381,0,alabama,381, Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an extremely high implementation rate.
382,0,alabama,382,Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In some years, it imposes more death sentences than Texas, a state that has a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384," However, executions per capita are considerably higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385, Some of his cases have been very controversial
386,0,alabama,386,It is the only State to allow judges to disregard jury decisions when applying the death penalty or not.
387,0,alabama,387, This judicial authority was dismissed from office in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,Taxes are collected by the Revenue Department of Alabama.
389,0,alabama,389,"Alabama collects a tax of 2, 4 or 5% on personal income, depending on the amount earned and production status."
390,0,alabama,390," Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if they take the standard deduction; those who include it can also deduct the FICA tax (social security tax and health insurance)."
391,0,alabama,391,The general rate of State sales tax is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392, Sales tax rates for towns and counties are also added to purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a dinner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"In 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 51 per cent of all government and local revenues, compared to an average of about 36 per cent nationally."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of the seven states that levy a food tax at the same rate as other goods, and one of the two states (the other being the neighbouring Mississippi) that fully taxes food without any compensatory relief for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most States exempt food products from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on working poor families is one of the highest in the United States, Alabama, the only state to levy income tax on a family of four whose income does not exceed $4,600, or just a quarter of the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,The Alabama threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.
399,0,alabama,399,The current corporate income tax rate is 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400," Overall, the federal, state and local tax burden in Alabama makes the state the second lowest tax burden in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Land taxes are the lowest in the United States.
402,0,alabama,402,The present Constitution of the State requires an electoral referendum to increase property taxes.
403,0,alabama,403," Since Alabama's tax structure is largely dependent on consumer spending, it is subject to a high variable budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit of $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405, There are 67 counties in Alabama.
406,0,alabama,406," Each county has its own elected legislative power, generally referred to as the county commission."
407,0,alabama,407,It also has a limited executive power in the county.
408,0,alabama,408," Due to the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power within the state's legislative power, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby and Tuscaloosa) in the state have a limited domestic regime."
409,0,alabama,409," Instead, most state counties must press the local Legislative Committee of the State Legislative Assembly for approval of simple local policies, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The State Legislative Assembly retained power over local governments by refusing to adopt a constitutional amendment establishing the county system of origin, as recommended by the Alabama Constitutional Commission of 1973."
411,0,alabama,411, Legislative delegations retain some powers for each county.
412,0,alabama,412,"The decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr (1964) required both houses to have population-based districts and redistributed after each census, in order to apply the principle of ""one man, one voice""."
413,0,alabama,413," Before that, each county was represented by a state senator, resulting in under-representation in the State Senate for the more urbanized and populated counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had failed to redistribute the seats in the state house, affected politics well before the 20th century, not recognizing the growth of industrial cities and urbanized areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The absence of a domestic regime in Alabama counties has led to the proliferation of local legislation allowing counties to do things that are not authorized by the constitution of the state."
416,0,alabama,416,"The constitution of Alabama has been amended more than 700 times, and nearly a third of the amendments are local in nature, applying only to one county or city."
417,0,alabama,417,"A significant part of each legislative session is devoted to local legislation, which removes time and attention from legislators on issues of importance at the state level."""
418,0,alabama,418,"Alabama is a state that controls alcoholic beverages, meaning that the state government has a monopoly on the sale of alcohol."
419,0,alabama,419,The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the State.

421,0,alabama,421," During the reconstruction after the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops in the third military district under the direction of General John Pope."
422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as Redemptors took control of the government of the state of republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423," After 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to separate and deprive African-American residents, a process completed in the provisions of the 1901 constitution."
424,0,alabama,424,The provisions that deny blacks the right to vote have led to the exclusion of many poor whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"In 1941, more whites than blacks had been deprived of their rights: from 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total effects have been greater for the black community, as almost all of its citizens have been deprived of their rights and have been relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law."
427,0,alabama,427," From 1901 to 1960, the state did not redraw electoral districts as the population increased and moved within the state during the urbanization and industrialization of certain regions."
428,0,alabama,428,"As the counties were at the base of the electoral districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state policy for nearly three quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases had to be redistributed in 1972 to achieve equal representation."
429,0,alabama,429,"Alabama State policy received national and international attention during the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, while whites, bureaucratically and sometimes violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."
430,0,alabama,430," Governor George Wallace, the only Governor of four state mandates, was a controversial figure who promised to maintain segregation."
431,0,alabama,431,"It was only after the adoption of the 1964 Federal Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Electoral Rights Act that African Americans regained the capacity to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many countries, they continue to be excluded from representation by electoral systems in general, allowing the majority of the population to dominate the elections."
433,0,alabama,433, Some changes have taken place at the county level as a result of judicial challenges to create single-member districts that allow for more diverse representation among county councils.
434,0,alabama,434,"In 2007, the Alabama Legislature voted, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing ""deep regret"" over slavery and its persistent impact."

712,1,alaska,712,"In total, 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state, known locally as ""Aboriginal languages""."
713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring that the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state have official status."
714,1,alaska,714," This bill gave them symbolic recognition as official languages, although it was not passed for official purposes within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages that have been included in the bill are:
716,1,alaska,716," According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2010, approximately 34% of Alaskans were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people identified themselves as evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholics and 32,550 as principal Protestants."

719,1,alaska,719,"The largest religious denominations in Alaska in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents, the non-denominational evangelical Protestants with 38,070 adherents, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Saints of the last days with 32,170 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents."
720,1,alaska,720," Alaska has been identified, as well as the Pacific Northwest States Washington and Oregon, as the least religious states in the United States, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,In 1795 the first Russian Orthodox church was established in Kodiak.
722,1,alaska,722, Marriages with Alaskan natives have helped Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches have gradually established themselves in Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724, Alaska also has the largest population of Quaker (percentage) in all states.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for which Halakha's compliance could pose special problems)."
726,1,alaska,726," Alaskan Hindus often share places and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, the Hindus of Alaska established the Sri Gansha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu temple in Alaska and the northernmost Hindu temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728," There's between 2,000 and 3,000 Hindus in Alaska."

737,1,alaska,737," According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75%."
738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80 per cent of the government's revenues from oil extraction."
739,1,alaska,739," Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture represents only a small fraction of Alaska's economy.
741,1,alaska,741," Agricultural production is mainly intended for consumption within the state and includes nurseries, dairy products, vegetables and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742," Manufacturing is limited, most food and general products being imported from elsewhere."
743,1,alaska,743," Employment primarily affects government and industries such as natural resource extraction, marine transportation and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744," Military bases are an important component of the economy of Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island, and Kodiak districts."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, enabling the state to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746," Industrial products include crude oil, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining activities, seafood processing, wood and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747, There is also a growing services and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748, Tourists contributed to the economy by supporting local housing.
749,1,alaska,749," Alaska has extensive energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted."
750,1,alaska,750," Significant oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, in February 2014, Alaska was ranked fourth in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota and California."
751,1,alaska,751," Prudhoe Bay on the northern slope of Alaska is still the second-high-yielding oil field in the United States, generally producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although at the beginning of 2014, the Bakken North Dakota Formation produced more than 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752," Prudhoe Bay is the largest conventional oil deposit ever found in North America, but it is much smaller than the huge Athabasca oil sands deposit in Canada, which produces approximately 1,500 000 barrels per day in 2014 (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil and has hundreds of years of productive reserves at this rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"The Trans-Alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"In addition, significant coal deposits are found in Alaska's oil, subbituminous and lignite basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of technically recoverable gas not discovered from natural gas hydrates on the northern slope of Alaska."
756,1,alaska,756, Alaska also has some of the country's highest hydroelectric potential from its many rivers.
757,1,alaska,757,Large sections of the Alaskan coast also have potential for wind and geothermal energy.
758,1,alaska,758," Alaska's economy relies heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electricity and light."
759,1,alaska,759," Although wind and hydro power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g., wind and hydro power) are underdeveloped, while proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g., wind and hydro power) are underdeveloped."
760,1,alaska,760,"It was found to be unprofitable (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low fuel prices (less than 50¢/gal), long distances and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of one gallon of gas in urban Alaska is generally thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally much higher, but vary greatly depending on transportation costs, seasonal peaks of use, nearby oil development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is an appropriation authorized by the Constitution of Oil Revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus of the state's oil revenues, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans-Alaska pipeline system."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the sale of the Prudhoe Bay lease in 1969, for fear that the legislature would spend all of the proceeds of the sale (i.e. $900 million) at the same time."
764,1,alaska,764,He was later defended by Governor Jay Hammond and State representative Kenai Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765," This is an attractive political perspective since then, diverting revenue that would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaskan Constitution has been drafted to discourage the allocation of state funds for a particular purpose.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mainly because of the political climate of distrust that prevailed at the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768," From its initial capital of $734,000, the fund has increased to $50 billion due to oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769, Most if not all of the capital is invested cautiously outside Alaska.
770,1,alaska,770," This has led Alaskan politicians to ask the Fund to make investments in Alaska, although such a position has never grown."
771,1,alaska,771," Beginning in 1982, dividends from the annual growth of the fund were paid each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial amount of $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years of payment, since the distribution of payments was retained in a distribution plan proceeding) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time amount of $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772," Each year, the state legislature withdraws 8% of the earnings, provides 3% of the capital for proof of inflation, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all eligible Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To be eligible for the dividend from the Permanent Fund, one must have lived in the State for at least 12 months, maintain permanent residence subject to authorized absences and not be subject to judicial judgements or criminal convictions that fall under various exclusion classifications or may subject the amount of the payment to civil arrest."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often seen as one of the main examples of a ""core income"" policy around the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the 48 adjacent states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal government officials, particularly U.S. Postal Service (USPS) employees and active members, receive a subsistence allowance usually set at 25 per cent of basic pay because, although the cost of living has decreased, it remains one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska is experiencing extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to relatively limited transportation infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778," Due to the northern climate and the short growing season, there is relatively little breeding in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779," Most farms are located either in the Matanuska Valley, about 64 km northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 97 km southwest of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make growing seasons productive."
781,1,alaska,781,"The main crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another remarkable agricultural site, particularly the Delta Junction area, about 160 km south-east of Fairbanks, with a large concentration of farms growing agronomic crops, mainly to the north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783, This region was largely set aside and developed as part of a state programme led by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784,The crops in the Delta region consist mainly of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"To the west of Fairbanks is another concentration of small farms that deal with restaurants, the hotel and tourism industry and community-supported agriculture."
786,1,alaska,786,"In recent years, Alaskan agriculture has seen strong growth in market gardeners, small farms and agricultural markets, with the largest percentage increase (46%) in the country's agricultural market growth in 2011, compared to 17% in the country as a whole."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a supply gap elsewhere in the world, filling a niche on the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788," Alaska, without a county, has no county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789," However, a small assortment of state fairs and local fairs (with Alaska's largest state fair in Palmer) take place mainly in late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"The fairs are mainly located in communities with historical or current farming activities, and feature local farmers who exhibit products in addition to more publicized commercial activities such as carnival walks, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792," Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with major fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific."
793,1,alaska,793,Seafood is one of the few foods that is often cheaper within the state than outside.
794,1,alaska,794," Many Alaskans take advantage of the salmon season to harvest portions of their domestic food while fishing for subsistence, as well as for sport."
795,1,alaska,795," This includes fish caught by hook, net, or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Subsistence hunting, mainly caribou, moose and Dall sheep, is still common in the state, particularly in remote Bush communities."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of a traditional indigenous diet is Akutaq, the Eskimo Ice Cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798," Alaska reindeer farming is concentrated on the Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mixing and migrating with domesticated reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799," Most foods in Alaska are transported to the state from ""outside,"" and shipping costs make food relatively expensive in cities."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, hunting and subsistence gathering is an essential activity because imported foods are prohibitive."
801,1,alaska,801," Although most of the small towns and villages in Alaska are along the coast, the cost of importing food into remote villages can be high, due to the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change considerably, due to variations in climate and precipitation."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transportation can reach as much as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult periods, if these locations can be reached at all during these adverse weather and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering one gallon (3.8 L) of milk is approximately $3.50 in many villages with a per capita income of $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"The cost of fuel per gallon is consistently twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous average of the United States, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805, Alaska has few road links compared to the other United States.
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road network covers a relatively small area of the state, connecting the central population centres with the Alaska Highway, the main exit route from the state across Canada."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a motor ferry; this has led for decades to a debate about moving the capital to a city on the road network, or the construction of a road link from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,Western Alaska has no road network linking communities to the rest of Alaska.
809,1,alaska,809,The interstate highways in Alaska comprise a total of 1082 miles.
810,1,alaska,810,"One of the unique features of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an Alaskan railway tunnel in operation recently renovated to provide an asphalt road link with the isolated community of Whittier on Prince William Strait to Seward Road, approximately 80 km southeast of Anchorage, Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 4.0 km, the tunnel was North America's longest road tunnel until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812,The tunnel is North America's longest combined road and rail tunnel.
813,1,alaska,813," Built around 1915, the Alaska Railway (ARR) played a key role in Alaska's development throughout the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It connects North Pacific ships by providing critical infrastructure with routes from Seward to the interior of Alaska through south-central Alaska, through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and the North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815," Cities, villages and the area served by the ARR are known throughout the State as the ""railway belt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the continuous improvement of the asphalt road system has begun to overshadow the importance of the railway to the Alaskan economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railway played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight to Alaska while transporting natural resources south, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy at Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley at Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,She is well known for her summer tourism service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaska Railway was one of the last railways in North America to use caboose in regular service and still use them on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last stopping roads of the country's flag.
821,1,alaska,821,A section of about 100 km of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road.
822,1,alaska,822," Until the construction of the park road in the 1970s, the railway provided the only land access to most of the area along its entire route."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northeastern Alaska, White Pass and the Yukon Highway also partially cross the state from Skagway northward to Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at the White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824," This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise ship in Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was featured in the 1983 BBC Great Little Railways TV series.
826,1,alaska,826,The Alaska Rail network is not externally connected.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The closest link to the North American rail system is the northwestern terminus of Canada's National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and under the age of 48."
829,1,alaska,829, Some private companies provide float services between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830," Many cities and villages in the State do not have access to the road or highway; the only modes of access are by air, river or sea."
831,1,alaska,831," Alaska's well-developed ferry network (called Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of the southeast, the Gulf coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832, Ferries carry vehicles as well as passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The network also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada through the inland passage to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important maritime link for many communities on Southeast Prince of Wales Island and works in collaboration with Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summer tourism market, mainly linking northwestern Pacific to southeastern Alaska and, to a lesser extent, cities along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska."
836,1,alaska,836,"The population of Ketchikan, for example, fluctuates dramatically for many days – up to four large cruise ships can moor there at the same time."
837,1,alaska,837," Cities not served by road, sea or river can only be reached by air, foot, dog sled or snow machine, representing Alaska's highly developed bush air services — a novelty of Alaska."
838,1,alaska,838,"Anchorage and, to a lesser extent, Fairbanks, are served by many major airlines."
839,1,alaska,839," Due to limited road access, air transport remains the most efficient form of transport within and outside the state."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed extensive renovation and construction work at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to accommodate the rise of tourism (in 2012-13, Alaska welcomed nearly two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841," Regular flights to most commercially viable villages and towns in the state are difficult to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government as part of the essential air services program."
842,1,alaska,842," Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering jet flights in the state (sometimes in combination with cargo and passengers Boeing 737-400) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional centres such as Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak and other large communities, as well as major communities in the southeast and Alaska Peninsula."
843,1,alaska,843," Most of the remaining commercial flights originate from small regional suburban companies such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"Smaller towns and villages have to rely on regular or chartered bush services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845," Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska mail bypass program, which subsidizes bulk delivery of mail to rural Alaskan communities."
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires that 70% of this grant be granted to carriers providing passenger transportation services to communities.
847,1,alaska,847, Many communities provide small air taxi services.
848,1,alaska,848, These operations are due to the demand for personalized transport to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849,The bush seaplane is perhaps the most quintessence aircraft in Alaska.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights to remote villages without airstrips carry passengers, cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,"In 2006, Alaska had the largest number of pilots per capita in a U.S. state."
852,1,alaska,852, Another means of transport in Alaska is the dog sled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (i.e., any time after the mid-1920s), dog mushing is more a sport than a means of transport."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are organized around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod sled dog race, a trail of 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum race in Nome in which moshers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicines very necessary to the diphtheria community of Nome when all other means of transport had failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from around the world come to Anchorage every March to compete for money, prizes and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that follows more precisely the route of the famous 1925 relay, starting from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) in Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by off-road vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as is commonly known in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859, Alaska's Internet and other data transportation systems are largely provided by the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and, at the end of 2011, Alaska Communications announced that it has ""two lines of fiber optics to the 48 minus and two more across Alaska."
861,1,alaska,861,"In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was planned, partly supported by $350 million in stimulus to the federal government."
862,1,alaska,862," Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive power composed of the Governor of Alaska and his appointed persons who are head of executive departments; a legislative power composed of the House of Representatives of Alaska and Senators of Alaska; and a judicial power composed of the Supreme Court of Alaska and lower courts."

2523,5,colorado,2523," Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than the north."
2524,5,colorado,2524," Most of Colorado consists of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,The surrounding mountains and valleys greatly affect the local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a general rule, an increase in altitude leads to a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeastern, eastern and southeastern Colorado are mostly the high plains, while northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills and mountains."
2528,5,colorado,2528,"The northwest and west of Colorado are mostly mountainous, and some desert lands are mixed."

2531,5,colorado,2531,"The area is known for its abundant sun and cool and light nights, giving this area a large range of average daytime temperature."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable because the heat dissipates in the space during the clear nights, the heat radiation being not trapped by the clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, home to most of Colorado's population, is in a shadow of heavy rainfall as it lies on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this region can have many days above 95°F (35°C) and often 100°F (38°C)."
2535,5,colorado,2535, Low winter temperatures in the plains typically range from 25 to -10°F (−4 to -23°C).
2536,5,colorado,2536," Approximately 75% of precipitation occurs during the growing season, from April to September, but this region is highly drought-prone."
2537,5,colorado,2537," Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and large snowstorms that occur in winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538," Otherwise, the winters tend to be more or less dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,"In most of the region, March is the most snowy month."
2540,5,colorado,2540,"April and May are usually the wettest months, while April is the wettest month overall."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"The cities of Front Range closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in winter due to Chinook winds that warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70°F (21°C) or higher in winter."
2542,5,colorado,2542,The average temperature for July is 55 °F (13 °C) in the morning and 90 °F (32 °C) in the afternoon.
2543,5,colorado,2543,"The average January temperature is 18°F (−8°C) in the morning and 48°F (9°C) in the afternoon, although the variation between consecutive days may be 40°F (20°C)."
2544,5,colorado,2544," Just west of the plains and in the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types."
2545,5,colorado,2545, Locations a few kilometres apart can experience a completely different time depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546," Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, which is not the case with the eastern plains, which move to an alpine climate at the highest altitudes."
2547,5,colorado,2547,"Microclimates also exist in local areas that cover almost the full range of climates, including subtropical highlands (Cfb/Cwb), wet subtropicals (Cfa), wet continentals (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterraneans (Csa/Csb) and subarctics (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548," Extreme climate change is common in Colorado, although a significant portion of extreme weather change occurs in the less populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549," Storms are common east of the continental ditch in the spring and summer, but are usually short."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"Hail is a common view in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern plains, especially the northeastern part of the state."
2551,5,colorado,2551,"Hail is the most frequently reported serious weather hazard in the warm season, sometimes causing human injury, as well as significant damage to property."
2552,5,colorado,2552,The eastern plains are prone to some of the largest hailstorms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553,"An example is the violent hailstorms that struck Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the most costly in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The eastern plains are part of the extreme west of the Tornado gangway; some harmful tornadoes on the eastern plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the 2008 Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern plains see particularly frequent tornadoes, whether from mesocyclones in supercell storms or from less intense tillages, as in the Denver convergence vorticity zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,"The plains are also exposed to occasional flooding and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused by both thunderstorms and the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather."
2557,5,colorado,2557,"Notable examples include the Denver flood in 1965, the Big Thompson flood in 1976, and the Colorado flood in 2013."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common during the summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's record in 1901 for consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken in the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561," Most of Colorado is very dry, with the average condition only 17 inches (430 millimetres) of precipitation per year on a state-wide basis."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely goes through a period when part of it is not to some extent drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563,"The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of forest fires in the state, such as the late Hayman of 2002."
2564,5,colorado,2564," Other notable fires include the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, the Waldo Canyon Fire, and the June 2012 High Park Fire, and the June 2013 Black Forest Fire."
2565,5,colorado,2565," Even these fires were overtaken by the pine mulch fire, Cameron Peak's fire, and the Eastern Disturbation Fire in 2020, all of which are the three largest fires in Colorado history (see Colorado Forest Fires in 2020)."
2566,5,colorado,2566," However, some of Colorado's mountainous regions receive a large amount of moisture from winter snowfall."
2567,5,colorado,2567,"Spring melting of these snows often causes high water flows in the Yampa River, Colorado, Rio Grande, Arkansas, North Platte River and South Platte River."
2568,5,colorado,2568,"Water flowing from the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very important source of water for farms, towns and cities in the southwestern states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada, as well as for the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas."
2569,5,colorado,2569,"A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; from time to time (formerly naturally and regularly), water flows reach northern Mexico."
2570,5,colorado,2570,"The highest official ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115°F (46.1°C) on July 20, 2019, at the John Martin Dam."
2571,5,colorado,2571,The lowest official air temperature was −61°F (−51.7°C) on 1 February 1985 in Maybell.
2572,5,colorado,2572," Despite its mountainous relief, Colorado is relatively calm on the seismic plane."

3358,7,delaware,3358,The definition of the northern limit of the state is unusual.
3359,7,delaware,3359, Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by a 12-mile arch (19.3 km) of the New Castle City Courthouse dome.
3360,7,delaware,3360, This limit is often referred to as the circle of Twelve-Miles.
3361,7,delaware,3361," Although the circle of twelve miles is often considered the only territorial border in the United States that is a true arc, the Mexican border with Texas includes several arches, and many cities in the South (such as the plains, Georgia) also have circular borders."
3362,7,delaware,3362," This boundary extends to the east to the low point on the shore of New Jersey, then continues south along the shore until it again reaches the 12 mile (19 km) arc in the south; and then the boundary continues more conventionally in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River."
3363,7,delaware,3363,"To the west, part of the arc extends beyond the eastern end of Maryland."
3364,7,delaware,3364,The rest of the western border runs slightly east of the south from its intersection with the arc.

3370,7,delaware,3370,A ridge of approximately 75 to 80 feet (23 to 24 m) extends along the western boundary of the state and separates watersheds that feed the Delaware River from the bay to the east and Chesapeake Bay to the west.
3371,7,delaware,3371," Since almost the entire Delaware is part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate."

3382,7,delaware,3382,"Delaware subsidizes the clean-up of ""lightly contaminated"" goods with hazardous waste, the product of which comes from a wholesale oil sales tax."
3383,7,delaware,3383," Before Delaware was colonized by European settlers, the region housed the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mainly along the coast, and the Nanticokes who occupied much of the Delmarva peninsula in the south."
3384,7,delaware,3384,"John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of Nanticoke, who may have retained small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating to Chesapeake Bay."
3385,7,delaware,3385,The Kuskarawocks were probably the Tuscaroras.
3386,7,delaware,3386,The Unami Lenape of the Delaware Valley were closely linked to the Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River.
3387,7,delaware,3387," They had a well-established hunting and farming society, and they quickly became intermediaries in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their former enemy, Minqua or Susquehannock."
3388,7,delaware,3388," With the loss of their land on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wanted to remain identified as such left the area and moved over the Alleghany Mountains in the mid-18th century."
3389,7,delaware,3389,"In general, those who did not move out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christians and were regrouped with others of colour in official documents and in the minds of their non-Aboriginal American neighbours."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the current Delaware in the Middle Region by establishing a trading post in Zwaanendael, near the Lewes site in 1631."
3391,7,delaware,3391,"In less than a year, all settlers were killed in a dispute with the Amerindian tribes in the region."
3392,7,delaware,3392,"In 1638, a new Sweden, a trading post and a Swedish colony was established in Fort Christina (now Wilmington) by Peter Minuit as head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch."
3393,7,delaware,3393,The colony of New Sweden lasted for 17 years.
3394,7,delaware,3394,"In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leaders of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at the present time New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the colony of New Sweden, annexing it to the Netherlands New Land."
3395,7,delaware,3395," Nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the leadership of James, the Duke of York."
3396,7,delaware,3396," Combating an earlier claim of Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, owner of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat doubtful property to William Penn in 1682."
3397,7,delaware,3397,"Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his province of Pennsylvania and praised what was then called the Duke's ""low counties on Delaware."""
3398,7,delaware,3398,Penn established the representative government and briefly combined its two possessions under a single General Assembly in 1682.
3399,7,delaware,3399," However, in 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had become so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the consent of the lower counties, and the two groups of representatives were beginning to meet alone, one in Philadelphia, and the other in New Castle."
3400,7,delaware,3400,Penn and his heirs remained the owners of the two and always appointed the same person governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory in the lower counties.

3407,7,delaware,3407," Citizens had good relations with the owner government, and they were generally given more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies."
3408,7,delaware,3408,The merchants at Wilmington harbour had commercial ties with the British.
3409,7,delaware,3409," This is how New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and John Dickinson, from Kent County, became the ""Penman of the Revolution""."
3410,7,delaware,3410,"In anticipation of the Declaration of Independence, patriotic leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separate from British domination and Pennsylvania on 15 June 1776."

3421,7,delaware,3421,The economies of these colonies were mainly based on labour-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves because of the decline of working-class immigrants in England.
3422,7,delaware,3422," Most English settlers had arrived as contract servants (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid."

3433,7,delaware,3433," Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins within the legislative power, in practice the State had for the most part put an end to this practice."
3434,7,delaware,3434,"In the 1860 census, on the brink of the civil war, 91.7% of the black population were free; 1,798 were slaves, compared with 19,829 ""free-coloured""."

3444,7,delaware,3444,"The Delaware essentially released the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the civil war, but rejected the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution; the 13th amendment was rejected on 8 February 1865, the 14th amendment was rejected on 8 February 1867, and the 15th amendment was rejected on 18 March 1869."

4272,9,georgia,4272," They made up 46.7 per cent of the population of the State in 1900, but the proportion of the population of Georgia that was African-American subsequently fell to 28 per cent, mainly due to tens of thousands of people leaving the State during the Great Migration."
4273,9,georgia,4273," According to the 2015 report of the Equal Justice Institute on lynching in the United States (1877-1950), Georgia killed 531 people, the second highest total of extrajudicial executions in any southern state."
4274,9,georgia,4274,The overwhelming majority of the victims were Blacks and Men.

4276,9,georgia,4276,"A Baptist minister born in Atlanta, who was part of the educated middle class that had developed in Atlanta's African-American community, Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as a national leader in the civil rights movement."

4278,9,georgia,4278,"On 5 February 1958, during a B-47 training mission, a Mark 15 nuclear bomb, also known as the Tybee bomb, was lost off the coast of Tybee Island near Savannah."
4279,9,georgia,4279,The Department of Energy thought that the bomb was buried in silt at the bottom of Wassaw Sound.
4280,9,georgia,4280,"In the 1960s, the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had fallen to 28% of the population of the state, after waves of migration to the north and some emigration by whites."

4286,9,georgia,4286,"In 1972, Georgians elected Andrew Young to Congress as the first African-American MP since the era of reconstruction."
4287,9,georgia,4287,"In 1980, the expansion of Atlanta Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport (ATL) was completed."
4288,9,georgia,4288,"The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than 100 million passengers every year."
4289,9,georgia,4289," With over 60,000 employees, the airport has become a major driver of economic growth."
4290,9,georgia,4290," With the benefits of cheap real estate, low taxes, the right to work and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, the Atlanta metropolitan area has become a national centre for finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, logistics and transportation, as well as film, convention and trade fair companies."
4291,9,georgia,4291,"In 1990, the International Olympic Committee selected Atlanta as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics."

4293,9,georgia,4293,"In 1992, construction was completed on Bank of America Plaza, the tallest building in the United States outside New York or Chicago."
4294,9,georgia,4294," From the Atlantic Ocean, the eastern border of the state with South Carolina goes up the Savannah River from the northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Senatorca rivers."
4295,9,georgia,4295,"It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and in the Chattooga River, its largest tributary."
4296,9,georgia,4296, These limits were determined in the Treaty of Beaufort of 1797 and tested by the Supreme Court of the United States in both Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989.
4297,9,georgia,4297,"The boundary then turns abruptly around the end of Rabun County at 35° north latitude, although from this point it diverges slightly southward (because of inaccuracies in the initial survey)."
4298,9,georgia,4298," This northern border was originally the border of Georgia and North Carolina to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was separated from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies encouraged the Georgian legislature to pass a law, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell most of Georgia's territory, which currently includes Alabama and Mississippi."
4299,9,georgia,4299,The western border of the state runs straight to the southeast from a point southwest of Chattanooga to the Chattahoochee River near West Point.
4300,9,georgia,4300,"It continues downwards to the point where it joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming the Apalachicola River of Florida); the south border goes almost full east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the St. Mary River, which then forms the rest of the border back to the ocean."
4301,9,georgia,4301,The water limits are always set to be the thalweg of origin of the rivers.
4302,9,georgia,4302," Since then, many have been flooded by lakes created by dams, including the Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint Point now under Seminole Lake."
4303,9,georgia,4303," Georgian legislators have claimed that, during a survey of 1818, the state border with Tennessee was wrongly placed a mile (1.6 km) further south than expected, and they continue to challenge it."
4304,9,georgia,4304,The correction of this inaccuracy would enable Georgia to have access to the water of the Tennessee River.
4305,9,georgia,4305, Each region has its own features.
4306,9,georgia,4306,"For example, the ridge and valley, located in the northwest corner of the state, include limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which produced building limestone, barite, ochre, and small quantities of coal."

4319,9,georgia,4319,"Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest altitudes."
4320,9,georgia,4320,"The entire state, including the mountains of North Georgia, receives moderate to heavy precipitation, ranging from 45 inches (1143 mm) in central Georgia to about 75 inches (1905 mm) around the northeast part of the state."
4321,9,georgia,4321,"The extent to which the time of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico and altitude."
4322,9,georgia,4322," This latter factor is felt mainly in mountainous areas in the northern part of the state, which are more distant from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level."
4323,9,georgia,4323,The hardiness zones of USDA plants for Georgia range from zone 6b (not colder than -5°F (−21°C)) in Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b (not colder than 15°F (−9°C)) along the Atlantic coast and the Florida border.
4324,9,georgia,4324,"The highest temperature ever recorded was 112°F (44.4°C) at Louisville on July 24, 1952, while the lowest was −17°F (−27.2°C) in northern Floyd County on January 27, 1940."
4325,9,georgia,4325," Georgia is one of the main states on the frequency of tornadoes, although they are rarely stronger than the EF1."
4326,9,georgia,4326," Although tornadoes hitting the city are very rare, an EF2 tornado hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings."
4327,9,georgia,4327," With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare in the 20th century."
4328,9,georgia,4328," Georgia is often affected by hurricanes that hit the Florida Panhandle, weaken on land and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rains inside, a recent example being Hurricane Michael, as well as hurricanes that are approaching the Georgian coast, brushing the coast on their way north without ever landing."
4329,9,georgia,4329, Hurricane Matthew 2016 and Hurricane Dorian 2019 did exactly that.
4330,9,georgia,4330," Due to anthropogenic change, Georgia's climate is warming."
4331,9,georgia,4331," This situation is already causing major disturbances, for example, due to sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable than many other states because its lands are sinking) and warming will continue to increase."
4332,9,georgia,4332,"The United States Census Office estimates that in 2019, Georgia had a population of 10,617,423, an increase of 97,948 over the previous year, and an increase of 929,770 (9.60%) since 2010."
4333,9,georgia,4333," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438,939 (849,414 births minus 410,475 deaths) and an increase in net migration of 606,673 people to the State."
4334,9,georgia,4334,"Immigration had resulted in a net increase of 228,415 persons, and internal migration had resulted in a net increase of 378,258 persons."
4335,9,georgia,4335,"In 2010, the number of illegal immigrants living in Georgia more than doubled to 480,000 between January 2000 and January 2009, according to a federal report."
4336,9,georgia,4336, This gave Georgia the largest percentage increase among the 10 states with the largest populations of illegal immigrants in those years.
4337,9,georgia,4337, Georgia banned the city-sanctuary.

4341,9,georgia,4341, Hispanics and Latinos of all races account for 8.8% of the population.
4342,9,georgia,4342,"In 2011, 58.8 per cent of the Georgian population under one year of age were minorities (i.e., they had at least one non-Hispanic white parent) compared to other states such as California with 75.1 per cent, New York with 55.6 per cent and Texas with 69.8 per cent."
4343,9,georgia,4343,The main groups of European descent are:
4344,9,georgia,4344,"In the 1980 census, 1,584,303 Georgians claimed English ancestry out of a total population of 3,994,817, making it 40 per cent of the state and the largest ethnic group at the time."
4345,9,georgia,4345," Today, many of these same people claiming to be of ""American"" descent are actually of English origin, and some of them are of Scottish origin; however, their families have been living in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify themselves simply as having an ""American"" ancestry or do not know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346," Their ancestry dates mainly to the thirteen colonies of origin and, for this reason, many of them are now content to claim American ancestry, although they are mainly of English origin."
4347,9,georgia,4347,"In 2004, 7.7 per cent of the Georgian population were under the age of 5, 26.4 per cent under the age of 18 and 9.6 per cent were 65 years of age or older."
4348,9,georgia,4348,"In 2004, women accounted for about 50.6 per cent of the population and African Americans for about 29.6 per cent."
4349,9,georgia,4349," Historically, about half of the Georgian population was made up of African-Americans who, before the Civil War, were almost exclusively slaves."
4350,9,georgia,4350,The large migration of hundreds of thousands of black people from rural south to industrial north from 1914 to 1970 reduced the American African population.
4351,9,georgia,4351," Georgia experienced the second fastest growth of the Asian population in the United States from 1990 to 2000, more than double its size over the ten-year period."
4352,9,georgia,4352,"In addition, according to the census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percentage of the total population of Afro-Americans (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and the third in terms of the digital black population after New York and Florida."
4353,9,georgia,4353, Georgia is the third country with the lowest percentage of older persons (65 years of age or older) at 12.8 per cent (in 2015).
4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonization of a large number of Scottish, English-American and Scotch-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmonts, and coastal colonization by some English-American and Afro-Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported into coastal areas in the eighteenth century on several occasions in rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the lower African-American country.
4356,9,georgia,4356," They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture continue more than in other fields."
4357,9,georgia,4357,"In the creolization of the culture of the South, their food routes have become an integral part of all the cuisines of the South in the Lower Country."
4358,9,georgia,4358,"In 2010, 87.35% (7,666,663) of Georgians aged 5 and over spoke English at home as their primary language, while 7.42% (651,583) spoke Spanish, 0.51% (44,702) Korean, 0.44% (38,244) Vietnamese, 0.42% (36,679) French, 0.38% (33,009) Chinese (including Mandarin) and German, which was spoken as their main language by 0.29% (23,351) of the population over 5 years of age."
4359,9,georgia,4359,"In total, 12.65 per cent (1 109,888) of the Georgian population aged 5 and over spoke a mother tongue other than English."
4360,9,georgia,4360," Atlanta, located in the north-central part of Georgia east of the continental division, has been the capital of Georgia since 1868."
4361,9,georgia,4361,"It is the most populated city of Georgia, with an estimated population of just over 506,000 in 2019."
4362,9,georgia,4362,"The metropolitan area of Atlanta is the cultural and economic centre of the southeast; its estimated population in 2019 was over 6 million, or 57% of Georgia's total."

4364,9,georgia,4364,"The state has 17 cities with a population of more than 50,000, according to estimates from the 2019 U.S. Census."
4365,9,georgia,4365," Together with the rest of the South-East, the population of Georgia continues to grow rapidly, with primary gains concentrated in urban areas."
4366,9,georgia,4366,"The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area increased by 1.23 million people (24%) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta moved from the eleventh U.S. metropolitan area to the ninth."
4367,9,georgia,4367,"The composition of religious membership in Georgia is 70% Protestant, 9% Catholic, 1% Mormon, 1% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist and 0.5% Hindu."
4368,9,georgia,4368,"Atheists, deists, agnostics and other non-affiliated persons make up 13% of the population."
4369,9,georgia,4369,"The largest Christian denominations according to the number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,759,317; the Methodist Church united with 619,394; and the Roman Catholic Church with 596,384."
4370,9,georgia,4370,"The non-denominational evangelical Protestant had 566,782 members, the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) had 175,184 members, and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. had 172,982."

4376,9,georgia,4376,Shabad and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute are also active in the state.
4377,9,georgia,4377,"As with all other U.S. states and the federal government, the Georgian government is based on the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial branches."
4378,9,georgia,4378,"The executive power of the state is vested in the governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republican)."
4379,9,georgia,4379,The Governor of Georgia and the Lieutenant Governor are elected by separate ballot for a four-year term.
4380,9,georgia,4380," Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. states, most of the executive officials who make up the governor's cabinet are elected by Georgian citizens rather than by the governor."
4381,9,georgia,4381," Legislative power is vested in the General Assembly, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives."
4382,9,georgia,4382,"The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker."
4383,9,georgia,4383,"The Constitution of Georgia provides for a maximum of 56 senators, elected in single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives distributed among representative districts (sometimes resulting in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives."
4384,9,georgia,4384,The term of office of senators and representatives is two years.

4392,9,georgia,4392," Some counties have been nominated for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, and many have names of Native American origin."
4393,9,georgia,4393,"The counties of Georgia have their own elected legislative power, generally referred to as the Council of Commissioners, which generally also has executive power in the county."
4394,9,georgia,4394," Several counties have a single form of Commissioner's government, with legislative and executive powers conferred on a single person."
4395,9,georgia,4395, Georgia is the only State currently home to the counties of Commissioner Sole.

4399,9,georgia,4399," Georgia does not provide for cantons or independent cities, although draft laws have been proposed by the Legislative Assembly to provide for cantons; it authorizes county governments consolidated by local referendum."
4400,9,georgia,4400,"All the second-ranked cities of Georgia, with the exception of Savannah, have now formed, by referendum, consolidated county governments: Columbus (in 1970, Athens (1990), Augusta (1995) and Macon (2012)."
4401,9,georgia,4401,(Augusta and Athens excluded one or more small incorporated cities within their consolidated borders; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all small incorporated entities within their consolidated borders.)
4402,9,georgia,4402,The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated county government after merging with the unincorporated County of Chattahoochee in 2003.

4405,9,georgia,4405," Georgia voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a series that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020."
4406,9,georgia,4406," Until 1964, the Georgian state government had the longest record of domination of a single party by the Democratic Party of any State of the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407, This record was set in large part due to the abandonment of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws at the beginning of the 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408," Some elements, such as the obligation to pay taxes and pass literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted in the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century."
4409,9,georgia,4409,"The White Democrats regained power after the reconstruction in part thanks to the efforts of some who resort to intimidation and violence, but this method has fallen into disrepute."
4410,9,georgia,4410,"In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a constitutional amendment in 1908, Blacks made up 47% of the population of the state."
4411,9,georgia,4411,"Whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice deprived blacks and poor whites, almost half the population of the state."
4412,9,georgia,4412,It required that any man at least 21 years of age wishing to register for the vote: (a) be of good moral character and be able to pass a citizenship test; (b) be able to read and write provisions of the constitutions of the United States and Georgia; or (c) possess at least 40 acres of land or $500 of property.
4413,9,georgia,4413, Any Georgian who had fought in any war of the American Revolution through the Hispano-American war was exempt from these additional qualifications.
4414,9,georgia,4414," Most importantly, any Georgian descendant of a veteran of one of these wars was also exempted."
4415,9,georgia,4415,"In 1908, many white men in Georgia were grandsons of veterans and/or possessed the required property, exemption and property requirement basically allowed only white people to vote."
4416,9,georgia,4416,"Good character qualifications, knowledge of citizenship and literacy (all subjectively determined by white registrars) and property were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote."
4417,9,georgia,4417,The lists of electors have dropped considerably.
4418,9,georgia,4418,"At the beginning of the 20th century, Progressive encouraged electoral reform and reduced the power of ward leaders to cleanse politics."
4419,9,georgia,4419," Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, have continued to effectively close illiterate people."
4420,9,georgia,4420,The rule of a party was solidified.
4421,9,georgia,4421,"For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians appointed and elected only white democratic governors and white democrats occupied the majority of seats in the General Assembly."

4691,10,hawaii,4691,The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an underwater magma source called the Hawaii Hotspot.
4692,10,hawaii,4692,"The process continues to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean moves continuously to the northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes."

4705,10,hawaii,4705,"As the Hawaiian Islands are distant from other terrestrial habitats, it is believed that life has reached them by the wind, waves (i.e."
4706,10,hawaii,4706,"by ocean currents) and wings (i.e.,"
4707,10,hawaii,4707," birds, insects, and seeds on their feathers)."
4708,10,hawaii,4708," This isolation, combined with the diversity of the environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates and dry shorelines), has allowed the evolution of endemic flora and fauna."

4714,10,hawaii,4714,The archipelago's main existing islands have been above the ocean's surface for less than 10 million years
4715,10,hawaii,4715,The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade field.
4716,10,hawaii,4716,"On a single island, the climate around the coast can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres of annual precipitation) to wet tropical; on the slopes, the environments range from rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5100 millimetres per year), to temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold and dry climate."

4724,10,hawaii,4724,"The Hawaiian climate is typical of the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of the almost constant trade winds in the east."
4725,10,hawaii,4725,"Summer levels usually reach approximately 88°F (31°C) during the day, with a low temperature of 75°F (24°C) at night."

4731,10,hawaii,4731,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state, at Pahala on April 27, 1931, was 100°F (38°C), making it bound to Alaska as the lowest temperature ever observed in the U.S. state."
4732,10,hawaii,4732, Its record low temperature is 12°F (−11°C) observed in May 1979 at the summit of Mauna Kea.
4733,10,hawaii,4733, Hawaii is the only state that has never recorded Fahrenheit subzero temperatures.
4734,10,hawaii,4734," Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into wind and wind zones (ko=olau and kona, respectively) depending on location relative to the upper mountains."

4736,10,hawaii,4736, Hawaii is one of the two states that were widely recognized independent nations before entering the United States.
4737,10,hawaii,4737,"The Kingdom of Hawaii was sovereign from 1810 until 1893, when the monarchy was overthrown by American and European resident capitalists and landowners."

4740,10,hawaii,4740,"On the basis of archaeological data, the first habitation in the Hawaiian Islands dates from about 300 AD, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands."
4741,10,hawaii,4741,A second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora occurred in the 11th century.
4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of the human discovery and residence of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of an academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743," Some archaeologists and historians believe that it is a wave of immigrants from Tahiti around 1000 AD who introduced a new line of high leaders, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the construction of heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744, This later immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (mo-olelo) on Pa-ao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745, Other authors say that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a subsequent influx of Tahitian settlers and that Paao should be considered a myth.
4746,10,hawaii,4746,"The history of the islands is marked by a slow and steady growth in the population and size of the capitals, which has developed to encompass entire islands."
4747,10,hawaii,4747,"The local leaders, called alii, ruled their colonies, and waged wars to expand their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals."
4748,10,hawaii,4748,"The former Hawaii was a caste-based society, as was the Hindu society in India."
4749,10,hawaii,4749,The arrival of the British explorer in 1778 Captain James Cook marked the first documented contact of a European explorer with Hawaii.
4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the archipelago ""Sandwich Islands"" in honour of its sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the location of the islands and making the native name Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form ""Owyhee"" or ""Owhyhee"" is preserved on behalf of certain locations in the U.S. Northwest Pacific, including Owyhee County and the Owyhee Mountains in Idaho, named after three Hawaiian Aboriginal members of an extirpated trapping party in the area."
4752,10,hawaii,4752,"It is very possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the sixteenth century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778."
4753,10,hawaii,4753,"Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 towards the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano on board as a pilot."

5196,11,idaho,5196,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Idaho was considered part of Oregon, a disputed area between the United States and the British Empire."
5197,11,idaho,5197,"It officially became American territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate territory from Idaho was only organized in 1863, instead of being included for periods in Oregon and Washington."
5198,11,idaho,5198,"Idaho was finally admitted to the Union on 3 July 1890, becoming the 43rd state."

5208,11,idaho,5208,"The official nickname of the State is ""the State of Gem"", which refers to the natural beauty of Idaho."
5209,11,idaho,5209,The origin of the name remains a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the U.S. Congress planned to organize a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician who presented himself as an unrecognized delegate of the unofficial Jefferson territory."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a Shoshone term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""the name of the mountains"", but it was later revealed that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he was inspired to give the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"As the name seemed to be made, the U.S. Congress finally decided to appoint the Colorado Territory region instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time that decision was made, the city of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been named according to Willing's proposal."
5213,11,idaho,5213," That same year, Congress created the territory of Colorado, a county called Idaho County, in eastern Washington."
5214,11,idaho,5214,"The county was named after a steam vessel called Idaho, which was launched on the Columbia River in 1860."
5215,11,idaho,5215,It is unclear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was revealed.
5216,11,idaho,5216,"In any case, part of Washington's territory, including Idaho County, was used to create the Idaho Territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217," Finally, the name was given to the territory of Idaho, which later became the U.S. state."
5218,11,idaho,5218," Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well during the 20th century repeated as Willing's narrative the name ""Idaho"" derived from the term Shoshone ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,A 1956 Idaho History Manual says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"An alternative to etymology attributes the name to the Plains Apache word ""ídaahęх"" IPA: [í.ta=.h=] (enemy) which was used with reference to the Comanche."

5237,11,idaho,5237,"The plain served as an easy passage through the Rocky Mountains for settlers westward on the Oregon Trail, and many settlers chose to settle in the area rather than risking the perfidious road through the blue mountains and the Cascade Range to the west."

5251,11,idaho,5251," Although the western border of the state is about 350 miles (560 km) from the Pacific Ocean, maritime influence is still felt in Idaho, especially in winter when cloud cover, humidity, and precipitation are at their peak."
5252,11,idaho,5252," This influence has a moderate effect in winter, where temperatures are not as low as might be expected in a northerly state where altitudes are mostly high."
5253,11,idaho,5253," Maritime influence is less pronounced in the eastern part of the state where rainfall is often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid continental climate."
5254,11,idaho,5254,"Idaho may be warm, although long periods over 98°F (37°C) are rare, with the exception of the lowest point of altitude, Lewiston, who sees little snow as a result."
5255,11,idaho,5255,"The warm summer days are tempered by low relative humidity and cooler evenings during the summer months since, for most states, the greatest diurnal temperature difference is often in summer."

5270,11,idaho,5270," Between that date and the creation of the Idaho territory on 4 March 1863 at Lewiston, parts of the present state were included in the territories of Oregon, Washington and Dakota."
5271,11,idaho,5271," Today, the new territory includes Idaho, Montana and most of Wyoming."
5272,11,idaho,5272,"The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the Pacific Highway and in 1806 on the return, largely following both directions of the Clearwater River."
5273,11,idaho,5273,"The first non-Aboriginal settlement was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Pend Oreille Lake for the fur trade in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company."
5274,11,idaho,5274,"In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near Lewiston today."
5275,11,idaho,5275," This position, known as ""MacKenzie's Post"" or ""Clearwater"", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was purchased by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned."
5276,11,idaho,5276,"The first attempts of organized communities, within the present borders of Idaho, were established in 1860."
5277,11,idaho,5277,The first community incorporated as a permanent and important corporation was Lewiston in 1861.
5278,11,idaho,5278," After a few tribulations as a territory, including the chaotic transfer from the territorial capital of Lewiston to Boise, the abandonment of the right to vote of the Mormonist polygamists supported by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, and a federal attempt to divide the territory between the territory of Washington which obtained state status in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho obtained state status in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,Idaho was one of the hardest hit by Pacific Northwest States during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280," Prices fell for major Idaho crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes earned only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income fall from $686 in 1929 to $250 in 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its business base as a state of tourism and agriculture to include the science and technology industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest economic centre in the state (more than 25 per cent of total government revenues) and are more important than agriculture, forestry and mining combined."
5283,11,idaho,5283,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Idaho population was 1,787,065 as of 1 July 2018, an increase of 14% since 2010."
5284,11,idaho,5284,"Idaho had an estimated population of 1,754,208 in 2018, an increase of 37,265 from the previous year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010."
5285,11,idaho,5285," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to the net migration of 75,795 people to the state."
5286,11,idaho,5286, There are a large number of English and German Americans in Idaho.
5287,11,idaho,5287,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 persons, and internal migration resulted in a net increase of 61,273 persons."
5288,11,idaho,5288," This made Idaho the tenth fastest growing state after the District of Columbia (+16.74%), Utah (+14.37%), Texas (+14.14%), Florida (+13.29%), Colorado (+13.25%), North Dakota (+13.11%), Nevada (+12.36%), Arizona (+12.20%) and Washington."
5289,11,idaho,5289," From 2017 to 2018, Idaho grew the second fastest, surpassed only the Nevada."
5290,11,idaho,5290,"Nampa, approximately 30 km west of downtown Boise, became the second largest city in the state in the late 1990s, passing through Pocatello and Idaho Falls."
5291,11,idaho,5291,"The population of Nampa was less than 29,000 in 1990 and increased to more than 81,000 in 2010."
5292,11,idaho,5292," Located between Nampa and Boise, Meridian has also experienced strong growth from less than 10,000 inhabitants in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now the third largest city in Idaho."

5299,11,idaho,5299,"The five largest groups of ancestry were German (17.5%), English (16.4%), Irish (9.3%), American (8.1%) and Scots (3.2%)."
5300,11,idaho,5300,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, resulting in a higher overall number."

5349,11,idaho,5349,"In 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market with the Idaho Public Services Commission regulating the three main utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,The energy landscape of Idaho supports the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,"The state is rich in renewable energy resources, but its fossil fuel resources are limited."
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller river basins provide Idaho with some of the country's best hydroelectric resources and geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind energy potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353, These realities have shaped a large part of the state's energy landscape.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports the bulk of the energy it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355," Imports account for over 80% of energy consumption, including the total supply of natural gas and oil to Idaho and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"In 2005, 48% of the electricity consumed in Idaho came from hydroelectricity, 42% came from coal combustion and 9% from natural gas combustion."
5357,11,idaho,5357,The rest comes from other renewable sources such as wind power.
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The many river basins in the state allow hydropower plants to supply 556,000 MWh, or about three quarters of the electricity generated by Idaho in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,The state of Washington provides most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two major pipeline networks that supply the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360," Although the State relies on sources outside the State for its total supply of natural gas, it uses natural gas-fired power plants to produce 127 000 MWh, or about 10 per cent of its production."
5361,11,idaho,5361, Coal production and the small grid of state wind turbines supply the rest of the state's electricity production.
5362,11,idaho,5362,The State produces 739 000 MWh but still has to import half of its electricity from third countries to meet demand.
5363,11,idaho,5363," While the 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) of Idaho are small compared to other states and account for only 0.5% of U.S. consumption, the state also has the country's 11th smallest population, 1.5 million people, so that its energy consumption per capita of 352 million BTU (103 MWh) is just above the national average of 333 million BTU (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th state in terms of the area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), distance creates the additional problem of the ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365," When the length of an electric transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electrical current passing through it is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States, with a population growth of 31% between 2008 and 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367," This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, further aggravating Idaho's limited hydropower resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has a higher estimate of the development potential to generate 44,320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind energy, and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar energy using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of photovoltaics on roofs, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar energy."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Department of Transport is the government agency responsible for Idaho's transport infrastructure, including operation and maintenance and planning of future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The Agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of federal funds, state funds and grants for government transportation programs."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is one of the few states of the nation without a major highway connecting its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"The United States-95 connects both ends of the state, but like many other Idaho highways, it is in dire need of repairs and improvements."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Department of Transport reported that the Government's road infrastructure was facing an annual deficit of $200 million in maintenance and modernization."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main road connecting the south-east and south-west parts of the State, as well as the I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Main Federal Aid Routes in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"Major airports include the Boise International Airport serving the southwestern Idaho and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) serving northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377, Other scheduled airports include Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving Palouse; Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and the north and west centre of Idaho; Magic Valley Regional Airport at Twin Falls; Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and Pocatello Regional Airport.
5378,11,idaho,5378,Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects Idaho Panhandle to Seattle, Portland and Spokane to the west and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"BNSF crosses the counties of Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary."
5381,11,idaho,5381,"The Union Pacific Railway crosses North Idaho by entering Canada via Boundary and Bonner, and by way of Spokane."
5382,11,idaho,5382,Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Northern Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland (Oregon).
5383,11,idaho,5383,"Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses the north of Idaho, with its only stop being at Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384," Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana, and Sandpoint, Idaho."
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific Railroad also crosses the southern Idaho between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,Lewiston Harbour is the farthest Pacific port from the west coast.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and Columbia River facilitate the movement of barges from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded onto ocean vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,"The constitution of Idaho is based almost on the national constitution, with several additions."
5389,11,idaho,5389,The Constitution defines the form and functions of the State government and may be modified by the plebiscite.
5390,11,idaho,5390,"In particular, the Constitution of the State currently requires that the Government of the State maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391," Therefore, Idaho has a limited debt (construction bonds, etc.)."

5394,11,idaho,5394,The code is amended by the Legislative Assembly with the approval of the Governor.
5395,11,idaho,5395,Idaho still operates under its original constitution (1889).
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The Idaho Constitution provides for three powers: executive, legislative and judicial."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"The Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected from 35 legislative districts, each represented by a senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398," Since 1946, state-wide elected constitutional leaders have been elected for a four-year term."
5399,11,idaho,5399," These include the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, the Idaho State Controller (prior to 1994), the Treasurer, the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Instruction."
5400,11,idaho,5400," Recently challenged in 1966, the Inspector of Mines was an originally elected constitutional office."
5401,11,idaho,5401," After that, it was a position appointed and finally completely abolished in 1974."
5402,11,idaho,5402,Idaho's government has a monopoly on alcohol.
5403,11,idaho,5403,The governor of Idaho has a four-year term and is elected in so-called national mid-term elections.
5404,11,idaho,5404," Thus, the Governor is not elected during the same election year as the President of the United States."
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current Governor is Republican Brad Little, who was elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,The Idaho Legislative Assembly is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407," However, the session can be extended if necessary and is often extended."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"For this reason, the legislators of Idaho are considered ""citizen legislators"", which means that their position as legislator is not their main occupation."
5409,11,idaho,5409,The term of office of the senator and the House of Representatives is two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410,"The general elections are held every year, even when numbered."
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The Idaho Legislature has been permanently controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although democratic legislators are systematically elected in Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and North Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,The Idaho Supreme Court is the highest court in Idaho.
5413,11,idaho,5413," There is also an interim court of appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeal, which hears cases referred to it by the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The state district courts serve seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416," Since 1919 there have been 44 counties in the state, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 km2)."
5417,11,idaho,5417, Three counties were first designated as such by the Territorial Parliament of Washington in 1861.
5418,11,idaho,5418," Since 1861, Nez Percé County has been divided into counties of Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai and Clearwater."
5419,11,idaho,5419,The Idaho licence plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county name.
5420,11,idaho,5420," When a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number shall accompany it in the previous alphabetical order."
5421,11,idaho,5421," This reflects an abnormal situation that coincides with the fact that 10 counties start with B, seven with C and four with L, or 21 of the 44 counties."
5422,11,idaho,5422," After the civil war, many democrats from the Midwest and the South settled in Idaho territory."
5423,11,idaho,5423,"As a result, the first territorial legislatures were firmly controlled by the democrats."
5424,11,idaho,5424,"On the other hand, most territorial governors were appointed by Republican Presidents and were Republicans."
5425,11,idaho,5425," This has led to sometimes bitter clashes between the two parties, including a war of scope with the Democrats supporting the shepherds and the Republicans the breeders, which ended in the trial for murder ""Diamondfield"" Jack Davis."
5426,11,idaho,5426,"In the 1880s, Republicans took a more prominent place in local politics."
5427,11,idaho,5427,"In 1864, Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and state constitution from a locked safe and took them to Boise."
5428,11,idaho,5428," This did indeed move the capital from where it was stored (Lewiston, Idaho) to the current capital Boise."
5429,11,idaho,5429," Since the creation of the state, the Republican Party is usually the dominant party of Idaho."
5430,11,idaho,5430,"At one point, Idaho had two democratic parties, one being the general public and the other, the anti-marmon democrats, which lasted at the beginning of the 20th century."
5431,11,idaho,5431,"In the 1890s and early 1900s, the populist party enjoyed importance, while the Democratic Party retained a brief domination in the 1930s during the Great Depression."
5432,11,idaho,5432," Since the Second World War, most of the state-wide elected representatives are Republicans, although the Democrats held the majority in the House (by one seat) in 1958 and in the post of Governor from 1971 to 1995."

5552,12,illinois,5552, Such a border would have left the landlocked Illinois on Lake Michigan at all.
5553,12,illinois,5553," However, as Indiana had been successfully granted an extension of its 16 km northern boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for the State of Illinois, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northerly boundary at the same latitude as Indiana, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost end of Lake Michigan."

6348,13,indiana,6348,A high percentage of Indiana's revenues come from the manufacturing sector.
6349,13,indiana,6349," According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 17 per cent of the government's non-agricultural labour force is employed in manufacturing, the highest of all states in the United States."
6350,13,indiana,6350,"The Government's top five exports were motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, optical and medical equipment and electrical machinery."
6351,13,indiana,6351," Despite its dependence on manufacturing, Indiana was less affected by the decline in traditional Rust Belt manufacturing than many of its neighbours."
6352,13,indiana,6352,The explanation appears to be some of the factors in the labour market.
6353,13,indiana,6353,"First, a large part of heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires a highly skilled workforce, and companies are often willing to locate where there are already skills that are difficult to train."
6354,13,indiana,6354,"Second, Indiana's workforce is mainly in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolitan areas."
6355,13,indiana,6355, This allows companies to offer wages somewhat lower than those normally paid for these skills.
6356,13,indiana,6356, Companies often see Indiana as a chance to acquire above-average skills at below-average earnings.

6376,13,indiana,6376," However, a ""break-through"" law enacted on 19 March 2008 limits property tax to 1% of the assessed value for owners, 2% for rental properties and agricultural land, and 3% for businesses."
6377,13,indiana,6377,"Indiana does not have a legal obligation to balance the state budget, neither in law nor in its constitution."

6386,13,indiana,6386,"Indiana also owns at least 900 million barrels of oil reserves in the Trenton field, although they are not easily recoverable."
6387,13,indiana,6387," While Indiana is committed to increasing the use of renewable resources such as wind, hydro, biomass and solar energy, progress has been very slow, mainly due to the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana."

6397,13,indiana,6397," There are no airlines operating from the Terre Haute regional airport, but it is used for private aircraft."
6398,13,indiana,6398," Since 1954, 181 Wing of the Indiana National Air Guard has been stationed there, but the 2005 Re-alignment and Closure Base (BRAC) proposal indicated that the 181st would lose its fighter mission and F-16 aircraft, leaving a combat aircraft facility at the Terre Haute facility."

6412,13,indiana,6412," Most Indiana counties use a network-based system to identify county roads; this system has replaced the old arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) it is much easier to identify call sources placed in the 9-1-1 system."
6413,13,indiana,6413, These systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central parts of the state.
6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to depend on non-systematic road names (e.g., Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott and Washington counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415, There are also counties in the northern parts of the state that have never set up a grid or implemented only part of it.
6416,13,indiana,6416," Some counties are also located in a grid system that is almost similar to that of diamonds (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson and Knox counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417, Such a system is also almost unnecessary in these situations.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"One day, Knox County used two different network systems for county roads because the county was built using two different surveying systems, but it has since decided to use the road names and to combine the roads instead."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"In particular, the county road network of St. Joseph County, the main city of which is South Bend, uses perennial names (trees) (i.e., trees)."

6541,14,iowa,6541," Much of the Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805, but only when Fort Madison was built in 1808 did the United States establish tenuous military control over the area."
6542,14,iowa,6542,"Fort Madison was built to control the trade and establish American domination over the Upper Mississippi, but it was misconceived and hostile by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom were allies with the British, who had not abandoned the claims to the territory."
6543,14,iowa,6543,"Fort Madison was defeated by the British-backed Aboriginal people in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby, on the Dog Prairie in Wisconsin, also fell into British hands."
6544,14,iowa,6544,Black Hawk participated in the siege of Fort Madison.
6545,14,iowa,6545, Another small military outpost was established along the Mississippi River in the present Bellevue.

6549,14,iowa,6549,"A disputed treaty of 1804 between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison, which delivered much of Illinois to the United States, enraged many Sauk and led to the Black Hawk War in 1832."
6550,14,iowa,6550,"The Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley in 1832 as part of Black Hawk's purchase and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of which settled in a reserve in Kansas."
6551,14,iowa,6551," Many Meskwaki then returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the Meskwaki settlement remains to this day."
6552,14,iowa,6552,"In 1856, the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented law that allowed Meskawki to buy land."
6553,14,iowa,6553," However, contrary to the unprecedented act of the Iowa Legislature, the United States federal government, through the use of treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk of Iowa in 1848 and the Dakota of Iowa in 1858."

6560,14,iowa,6560,"On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th State of the Union when President James K. Polk signed the Iowa Admission Bill."
6561,14,iowa,6561," Once admitted to the Union, the State's border problems resolved, and most of its land purchased from Aboriginal people, Iowa gave its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the rich agricultural lands of the young border state, good citizens, free and open society, and good government."
6562,14,iowa,6562,Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs.
6563,14,iowa,6563,The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of Fairfield State.
6564,14,iowa,6564,"The first fair was held from October 25 to 27, 1854, at a cost of approximately $323."
6565,14,iowa,6565," Subsequently, the fair moved to places closer to the centre of the state and in 1886 found a permanent house in Des Moines."
6566,14,iowa,6566," Since then, the State Fair has been held every year, with a few exceptions: in 1898 because of the war between Spain and America and the World Fair held in Omaha, Nebraska, nearby; from 1942 to 1945 because of the Second World War, because the fairs were used as a supply depot for the army; and in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."
6567,14,iowa,6567,"The Iowa supported the Union during the civil war, voting strongly for Abraham Lincoln, although there was an anti-war ""Copperhead"" movement in the state, caused in part by a fall in crop prices caused by the war."
6568,14,iowa,6568," There was no battle in the state, although the Battle of Athens, the Missouri, 1861, was fought just in front of the Croton Moines River, the Iowa, and the shots of the battle landed in the Iowa."
6569,14,iowa,6569,The Iowa sent important supplies to the armies and eastern cities.
6570,14,iowa,6570," Much of Iowa's support of the Union can be attributed to Samuel J. Kirkwood, his first war governor."

6572,14,iowa,6572,"Iowa contributed proportionately more men to the military service of the civil war than any other state, north or south, by sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, more than a sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates went to Appomattox."
6573,14,iowa,6573, Most of them fought in the large countryside in the Mississippi Valley and in the South.
6574,14,iowa,6574,"Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri, Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge and Rossville Gap, as well as Vicksburg, Iuka and Corinth."

6580,14,iowa,6580," After the civil war, the Iowa population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 in 1860 to 1,624,615 in 1880."
6581,14,iowa,6581,The U.S. civil war briefly brought higher profits.
6582,14,iowa,6582,"In 1917, the United States entered the First World War and farmers and all Iowans had an economy in times of war."
6583,14,iowa,6583,"For farmers, the change was important."
6584,14,iowa,6584," Since the beginning of the war in 1914, the Iowa peasants have enjoyed economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war."
6585,14,iowa,6585,"In the economic sector, Iowa has also undergone significant changes."
6586,14,iowa,6586," Since the first industries developed in the 1830s, mainly for the processing of materials grown in the region, Iowa has seen a gradual increase in the number of enterprises and manufacturing operations."
6587,14,iowa,6587,The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy has been slow.
6588,14,iowa,6588,"The Great Depression and the Second World War accelerated the shift from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend towards urbanization."
6589,14,iowa,6589,The post-World War II period was marked by a particular increase in manufacturing operations.
6590,14,iowa,6590,"The agricultural crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing the poverty that has not been observed since the depression."

7900,17,louisiana,7900,A Royal Order of 1722 – following the Crown's transfer of the governance of Illinois country from Canada to Louisiana – may have presented the broadest definition of Louisiana: all the lands claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies.
7901,17,louisiana,7901,"A generation later, trade disputes between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, the Governor General of Louisiana, Vaudreuil, fixed the northern and eastern boundaries of his estate, such as the Wabash Valley to the mouth of the Vermilion River (nearly today Danville, Illinois); thence from the northwest to the Rock on the Illinois River, and thence west to the mouth of the Rock River (now Rock Island, Illinois)."
7902,17,louisiana,7902,"For example, Vincennes and Peoria were the limits of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (nearly today Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada."
7903,17,louisiana,7903,"The colony of Natchitoches (long of the Red River in the present northwest of Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau of St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana."
7904,17,louisiana,7904,"The French establishment had two objectives: to establish exchanges with the Spanish in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road, and to discourage Spanish advances in Louisiana."
7905,17,louisiana,7905,"The colony soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving birth to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were exploited by imported African slaves."
7906,17,louisiana,7906,"Over time, the planters have developed large plantations and built beautiful houses in a growing city."
7907,17,louisiana,7907," This has become a repeated model in New Orleans and other places, although the cultivation of commodities in the south was mainly sugar cane."
7908,17,louisiana,7908,"The French colonies of Louisiana contributed to exploration and outposts, concentrated along the shores of Mississippi and its main tributaries, from Louisiana to the north of the area known as Illinois, around the present-day Saint-Louis, Missouri."
7909,17,louisiana,7909,The latter was established by French settlers in Illinois.
7910,17,louisiana,7910," Initially, Mobile and then Biloxi served as the capital of La Louisiana."
7911,17,louisiana,7911," Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River for trade and military interests, and wishing to protect the capital from violent coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civil and military authority in the south of the Great Lakes."
7912,17,louisiana,7912," From then on, until the United States acquired the territory in Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of Mississippi."
7913,17,louisiana,7913,"In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River in an area called the German coast."
7914,17,louisiana,7914,"France ceded most of its territory east of Mississippi to Britain in 1763, following Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War (generally called the French and Indian War in North America)."
7915,17,louisiana,7915,"The rest of Louisiana, including the region around New Orleans and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, became a colony of Spain by the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)."
7916,17,louisiana,7916,The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.
7917,17,louisiana,7917,"In 1765, during Spanish domination, several thousand Francophone refugees from the Acadia region (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada) visited Louisiana after being expelled from their homeland by the British during the French and Indian War."
7918,17,louisiana,7918," They settled mainly in the southwest region of Louisiana, now known as Acadiana."
7919,17,louisiana,7919," Governor Luis de Unzaga y Amézaga, who wanted to win more settlers, welcomed the Acadian refugees, the ancestors of the Cajuns of Louisiana."
7920,17,louisiana,7920,"The Spanish Canary Islands, known as Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783."
7921,17,louisiana,7921,"In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte took over Louisiana from Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years."
7922,17,louisiana,7922,"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies."
7923,17,louisiana,7923,"In 1709, French financier Antoine Crozat obtained a trade monopoly in La Louisiana, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois."
7924,17,louisiana,7924,"""This concession allowed him to bring a cargo of African blacks every year,"" writes British historian Hugh Thomas."
7925,17,louisiana,7925," Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh that there was high mortality among both settlers and slaves, resulting in continued demand for and import of slaves."
7926,17,louisiana,7926," From 1719, traders began importing more slaves; two French ships, Du Maine and Aurore, arrived in New Orleans, carrying more than 500 black slaves from Africa."
7927,17,louisiana,7927,The former slaves of Louisiana had been transported from the French colonies in the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721 New Orleans had 1,256 inhabitants, approximately half of whom were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724, the French government published a law called the Code Noir (""Code Noir"" in English) which ""regulates the interaction of white [white] and black [black] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much greater than the present state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law included 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, prohibited ""interracial"" marriages (those between people of different skin colour, whose varying nuances were also defined by law), restricted the Manumission, described the legal penalties imposed on slaves for various offences and defined certain obligations of owners towards their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main intention of the French government was to exercise control over the system of slavery of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on the owners of slaves there.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Black Code was extremely difficult to enforce from afar."
7933,17,louisiana,7933," Some priests continued to perform interracial wedding ceremonies, for example, and some slave owners continued to handle slaves without permission, while others brutally punished slaves."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Black Code of 1724 obliges owners to give their slaves religious education in the State religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935, Sunday was a day of rest for the slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On the days off, the slaves had to feed themselves and take care of them."
7937,17,louisiana,7937," During the economic crisis of the 1740s in the colony, the owners struggled to feed their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938," Giving them free time also gave more power to the slaves, who began to grow their own gardens and make items for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939," They began to participate in the economic development of the colony, while increasing independence and self-subsistence."
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Black Code prohibits mixed marriages, prohibits mixed marriages, but hardly protects women slaves from the rape of their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941," Overall, the Code benefits owners but has more protection and flexibility than the establishment of slavery in the 13 southern colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 makes the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers are rarely prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"Fugitive slaves, called marons, could easily hide in the hinterland of bayous people and survive in small colonies."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maron"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", i.e. ""fugal cattle""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"At the end of the 18th century, the last Spanish governor of Louisiana territory wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946," When the United States bought Louisiana in 1803, it was quickly accepted that African slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighbouring Mississippi, although it violated American law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947," Despite the demands of Rep. James Hillhouse of the United States and the brochure Thomas Paine to enforce the federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the cheapest work."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"In the early 19th century, Louisiana was a small sugar producer with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Santo Domingo and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949," Shortly thereafter, she became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations."
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, the first American governor of Louisiana, stated that the work of African slaves was necessary because white workers ""can't be had in this unhealthy climate."""
7951,17,louisiana,7951," Hugh Thomas writes that Claiborne is unable to implement the abolition of the slave trade in Africa, which the United States and Great Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastal trade, the shipping of slaves along the Atlantic coast to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"In 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the United States, making a significant contribution to the economy of the city and the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,"New Orleans had become one of the richest cities, and the third largest in the nation."
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and the importation of slaves has increased demand in the domestic market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"Over the decades since the American Revolution War, more than a million African slaves have been forced to migrate from the South to the South, two thirds of them in the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957, Others were transported by their owners as slave owners moved westward to find new lands.
7958,17,louisiana,7958," With the shift in agriculture in the Upper South as planters moved from tobacco to less labour intensive mixed agriculture, planters had surplus workers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959, Many sold slaves to traders to take them to the deep south.
7960,17,louisiana,7960,The slaves were driven by Upper South traders or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by boat as part of the slave trade on the coast.
7961,17,louisiana,7961," After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on Mississippi transported slaves to markets or plantation destinations in Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,The Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted between 1769 and 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963," From the 1790s onwards, waves of immigration took place in Santo Domingo, following a slave rebellion that began in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants have landed in Louisiana on the island, including ethnic Europeans, free people of colour and African slaves, some of whom are brought by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965," They have greatly increased the French-speaking population of New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and slaves have strengthened African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The process of independence in Santo Domingo was complex, but the uprisings continued."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803, France withdrew its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two thirds sent to the island two years earlier, mainly with yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic of the Western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, carried out by the leaders of the slaves."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) said: ""Saint-Domingue is, of all our colonies in the West Indies, the one whose mentality and customs have most influenced Louisiana."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970," When the United States gained independence from Britain in 1783, one of its main concerns was to have a European power at its western border and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As the American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachians constituted an obstacle to the shipment of goods to the east."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship the goods was to use a flat boat to float it in Ohio and Mississippi to the port of New Orleans, where the goods could be placed on ocean vessels."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this route was that the Spaniards had both sides of Mississippi under Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974, Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana implied the creation of a new empire focused on the Caribbean sugar trade.
7975,17,louisiana,7975," Under the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain restored to the French the property of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe."
7976,17,louisiana,7976," Napoleon looked at Louisiana as a deposit for these sugar islands, and as a buffer for the American establishment."
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a great military force to take over Santo Domingo, then under the control of Toussaint Louverture after a rebellion of slaves.When the army led by Napoleon Leclerc's brother-in-law was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was troubled by Napoleon's plans to re-establish the French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979," With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could at any time close Mississippi to American commerce."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, U.S. Minister in France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, parts of the east shore of Mississippi, and the free navigation of the river for U.S. trade."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer from Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's contract with the Spaniards was a poorly guarded secret at the border."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, the acting intendant of Louisiana, made public Spain's intention to revoke the right of deposit in New Orleans for any cargo originating in the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port in the United States caused anger and consternation.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,"In the West, trade was practically blocked."
7986,17,louisiana,7986," Historians believe that the revocation of the deposit was caused by the abuses committed by the Americans, in particular by smuggling, and not by the French intrigues, as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987," President Jefferson ignores public pressure for the war with France, and appoints James Monroe as Special Envoy to Napoleon, to help secure New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson also increased authorized expenditures to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989," However, on April 11, 1803 French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how willing the United States was to pay for the whole of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered it)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon could withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them without the possibility of obtaining the desired region of New Orleans), and that President Jefferson's approval could take months, so that Livingston and Monroe decided to open the negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"As of April 30, they entered into a contract for the purchase of the entire territory of Louisiana of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for sixty million francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,Part of that $3.5 million was used to repay France's debts to the United States.
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in US bonds, which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch company Hope and Company, and to the British bank house in Baring, at a discount of $87,1⁄2 per unit of $100."
7994,17,louisiana,7994," Consequently, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"English banker Alexander Baring confided Marbois in Paris, fled to the United States to recover the bonds, took them to Great Britain and returned to France with the money Napoleon used to wage war against his own country."
7996,17,louisiana,7996," When the news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,He had authorized expenditures of $10 million for a port city and received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a set of lands that would double the size of the country.
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents to the Federalist Party argued that the purchase in Louisiana was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new lands or the negotiation of treaties without the consent of the senator."
7999,17,louisiana,7999," What really worries the opposition is the new states that will inevitably be cut off from Louisiana territory, reinforcing Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England's federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000," President Jefferson was a strong supporter of westward expansion, and he was firm in his support of the treaty."
8001,17,louisiana,8001," Despite federalist objections, U.S. senators ratified the Treaty of Louisiana on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002,"By law promulgated on 31 October 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories transferred by France and to ensure the initial governance."
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004," Since the territory of Louisiana had never been officially handed over to the French, the Spaniards removed their flag, and the French lifted their flag."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,"The next day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States."
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony took place in Saint-Louis on 9 March 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The next day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the early United States"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,The artillery marched its troops in the city and brought up the American flag on the mast of the fort.
8009,17,louisiana,8009," Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the U.S. government, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010,"The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three hundred per acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without war or loss of a single American life, and created a precedent for the purchase of territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It has paved the way for the possible expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012," Shortly after the seizure of possession of the United States, the region was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north, on 26 March 1804, thus organizing the territory of Orleans to the south and the district of Louisiana (later formed as the territory of Louisiana) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013, Louisiana became the eighteenth state of the United States on 30 April 1812; the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana and the territory of Louisiana simultaneously became the territory of Missouri.
8014,17,louisiana,8014,A region known as Florida Parishes was soon annexed to Louisiana on 14 April 1812.
8015,17,louisiana,8015," From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a separate two-party system, with the Democrats competing first with the Whigs, then with the Know Nothings, and finally with other Democrats."
8016,17,louisiana,8016," According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, or nearly 47 per cent of the total population of the State, or 708,002 people."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,The strong economic interest of the elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to separate from the Union on 26 January 1861.
8018,17,louisiana,8018,He followed other southern states in secession after Abraham Lincoln's election as president of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019,"The secession of Louisiana was announced on 26 January 1861, and became an integral part of the Confederate States of America."
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated during the civil war, the result of the Union's strategy to cut Confederation in half by seizing Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,"The federal troops seized New Orleans on April 25, 1862."
8022,17,louisiana,8022," Because a large part of the population had sympathies with the Union (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own representatives elected to the American Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023," After the civil war and the emancipation of slaves, violence intensified in the South while the war was being waged by private and paramilitary insurgent groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024," Initially, state legislatures were dominated by former confederates, who adopted black codes to regulate free men and generally refused to vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025, They refused to grant the right to vote to African-Americans who had been free before the war and who had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).
8026,17,louisiana,8026," Following the Memphis riots in 1866 and the riot in New Orleans that same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted which provided the suffrage and full citizenship to the liberated men."
8027,17,louisiana,8027," Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, which establishes military districts for states where conditions were considered to be the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,It was clustered with Texas in what was administered as the fifth military district.
8029,17,louisiana,8029, African-Americans have begun to live as citizens with a certain degree of equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030,"Freed men and people of colour who had been free before the war began to make more progress in education, family stability and employment."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was huge social volatility in the aftermath of the war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labour market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to impose white supremacy, first in Ku Klux Klan chapters."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"In 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white democrats in Louisiana and other states regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which eliminated the black vote through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034," According to the example of Mississippi in 1890, in 1898, the white, democratic, planter-dominated legislature adopted a new constitution that effectively deprived people of colour of their right to vote, raising obstacles to voter registration, such as voting taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect was immediate and long lasting.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896 there were 130,334 black voters on the lists of electors and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the population of the State, which was also divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"In 1900, the population of the State was 47 per cent African-Americans, a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038," Many in New Orleans were descendants of creoles of color, the large population of people free of colour before the civil war."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"In 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the State."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"In 1910, there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5% of eligible African American men), despite the progress made in the education and literacy of Blacks and people of colour."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve in juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"The White Democrats established a one-party democratic regime, which they maintained in the state for decades deep in the 20th century until, after the passage by Congress of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the federal government monitored and enforced the constitutional right to vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African-Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,The infestation of the plow and agricultural problems have cost many farmers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,Mechanization of agriculture has also reduced the need for workers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046," From the 1940s, Blacks went west to California for jobs in its expanding defence industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047," During part of the Great Depression, Louisiana was ruled by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected on populist appeal.
8049,17,louisiana,8049," His public works projects have provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he has supported education and increased vote for the poor whites, but Long has been criticized for his supposedly demagogical and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He extended the control of patronage to all branches of Louisiana's state government.
8051,17,louisiana,8051, His plans to redistribute wealth in the State were particularly controversial.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule came to an abrupt end when he was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,Mobilizing for the Second World War created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,But thousands of other black and white workers have migrated to California for better jobs in its burgeoning defence industry.
8055,17,louisiana,8055," Many African-Americans left the state during the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s to the 1960s, to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had significantly reduced the need for workers.
8057,17,louisiana,8057," They were looking for qualified jobs in the defence industry in California, for better education for their children, and lived in communities where they could vote."

8063,17,louisiana,8063," Despite this, the registration and turnout of black voters gradually increased to 20 per cent or more, and it was 32 per cent in 1964, when the first national legislation on civil rights at the time was adopted."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"The percentage of black voters has varied considerably over the years, from 93.8% in the evangelical parish to 1.7% in the parish of Tensas, for example, where white efforts were made to suppress the vote in the parish with a black majority."

8095,17,louisiana,8095, Louisiana is bordered by Texas west
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The State can be well divided into two parts, the northern highlands, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial region includes low marshlands, coastal marshes and beaches and barrier islands that cover approximately 20,000 square miles (52,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098," This area is mainly along the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi, which crosses the state from north to south about 600 mi (970 km) and flows into the Gulf of Mexico; the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The width of the alluvial region along Mississippi is 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100 km), and along the other rivers the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15 km) on the other side."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as the dike), from which the land declines to a river beyond an average fall of six feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,Alluvial lands along other watercourses have similar characteristics.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The upper and contiguous hills of the northern and north-western parts of the state have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103, They consist of meadows and forests.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,Altitudes above sea level vary from 10 feet (3 m) on the coast and marshy lands to 50–60 feet (15–18 m) on grasslands and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the highlands and hills, altitudes rise to Mount Driskill, the highest point of the state at only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106," From 1932 to 2010, the State lost 1,800 square miles due to rising sea levels and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPAR) spends approximately $1 billion annually to assist in the establishment and protection of Louisiana's coastline and lands through federal and state funding.
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"In addition to the previously named streams, there is Sabine, which forms the western boundary; and Pearl, the eastern boundary; Calcasieu, Mermentau, Vermilion, Bayou Teche, Atchafalaya, Boeuf, Bayou Lafourche, Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, Macon River, Tensas, Amite River, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Natalbany River and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural network of navigable streams, more than 6,400 km in length."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The State also has political jurisdiction over the portion of approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) of underwater land on the inland continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110,"By a particular feature of the political geography of the United States, it is a territory far less than the 14-kilometre-wide jurisdiction of the neighbouring states of Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have vast coasts of the Gulf."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The south coast of Louisiana in the United States is one of the most disparate regions in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112, This is largely due to human mismanagement of the coast (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one point, the land was added as spring floods of the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated the growth of the marshes; the land is now shrinking."
8114,17,louisiana,8114, There are many causes.
8115,17,louisiana,8115, Artificial dykes block spring floodwater that would bring fresh water and sediment to the marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"The marshes have been widely exploited, leaving canals and ditches that allow saltwater to move within the country."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move seawater inward, damaging marshes and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,The increase in seawater has exacerbated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119, Some researchers estimate that the state loses land mass equivalent to 30 football fields each day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120," There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including the rehabilitation of natural floods in Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121," Without such a restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as communities disappear, more and more people leave the area."
8123,17,louisiana,8123,"As coastal wetlands support an economically significant inshore fishery, the loss of wetlands has a negative impact on this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,"The ""dead zone"" of the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States."
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"In 2017, it stood at 32730 km2 and was the largest ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico didn't exist 250 million years ago when there was only one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As Pangea separates, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico open."
8128,17,louisiana,8128," Louisiana developed slowly, for millions of years, from water to land, and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,"The oldest rocks are exposed in the north, in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest."
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date from the beginning of the Cenozoic era, about 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,The history of the formation of these rocks is found in D. Speaking's Roadside Louisiana Geology.
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest parts of the state have been formed over the past 12,000 years as successive Mississippi deltas: the Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, the modern Mississippi, and now the Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133,Sediments were transported from north to south by Mississippi.
8134,17,louisiana,8134," Between northern tertiary rocks and relatively new sediments along the coast, there is a large belt known as Pleistocene Terraces."
8135,17,louisiana,8135, Their age and distribution may be largely related to sea-level rise and fall in recent ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had enough time for rivers to cut deep canals, while the more recent terraces tend to be much more flattered."
8137,17,louisiana,8137,Domes of salt can also be found in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138, Their origin dates back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean had high evaporation rates.
8139,17,louisiana,8139," There are several hundred domes of salt in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140,The salt domes are important not only as a source of salt
8141,17,louisiana,8141," Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long, warm, humid and short summers, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, its low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which, at its furthest point, is not more than 200 mi (320 km)."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rain is common throughout the year, but from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state wet season."
8144,17,louisiana,8144, There was a decrease in precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, storms build up during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief tropical showers."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In winter, rains are more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures between June and September, with an average of 90°F (32°C) or higher, and minimum night temperatures above 70°F (21°C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148," Sometimes temperatures in the 1990s F, combined with dew points in the higher 70s F, create sensitive temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The wet, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and films."
8150,17,louisiana,8150,"The temperatures are generally warm in winter in the southern part of the state, with peaks around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico on average 66°F (19°C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the condition is slightly cool in winter, with average heights of 59°F (15°C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152," Low nights in winter averaged well above freezing in the entire state, with 46°F (8°C) mean near the Gulf and 37°F (3°C) mean low in winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153," Occasionally, the cold fronts of low pressure centres in the north reach Louisiana in winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154," Low temperatures close to 20°F (−7°C) sometimes occur in the northern part of the state, but rarely in the southern part of the state."
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although people in northern parts of the state may receive snow dust a few times a decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"The highest temperature recorded in Louisiana was 114 °F (46 °C) at Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded was −16 °F (−27 °C) at Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157," Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to major hurricane strikes, particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can cause damage to water through a large area of major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The region is also subject to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state is on average more than 60 days of storms per year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161, Louisiana has an average of 27 tornadoes per year.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The entire State is vulnerable to a tornado, with the southernmost part of the State slightly less than the rest of the State."
8163,17,louisiana,8163, Tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the State and from February to March in the northern part of the State.
8164,17,louisiana,8164," Because of its location and geology, the state has a great biodiversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165," Some vital areas, such as the southwest prairie, have experienced a loss of more than 98%."
8166,17,louisiana,8166," Flat pines are also highly exposed, mainly to fire extinction and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167, There is not yet a well-organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biodiversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168," Such a system would consist of a protected system of basic areas linked by biological corridors, as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169, Louisiana has a number of areas that to varying degrees prevent people from using them.
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to national parks and a national forest in the United States, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, a state conservation area, a state forest and many wildlife management areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of the most important public areas of Louisiana is the Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172," There are approximately 600,000 acres of land, more than half of which are flat forests, home to many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173, These include the Louisiana Pine Snake and the red peacock pike.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The government-owned cypress marsh system around Pontchartrain Lake is another large area, with southern wetland species including scratches, alligators and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 base areas would be required to build a ""protected area system"" for the state; these would be southwestern grasslands, the Pearl River floodplain to the east, and the Mississippi alluvial marshes to the north."
8176,17,louisiana,8176," Historical or picturesque areas managed, protected or recognized by the National Parks Service include:"
8177,17,louisiana,8177," Louisiana operates a network of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and a state preservation area."
8178,17,louisiana,8178," Louisiana has 955,973 acres in four ecoregions under wildlife management in Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries."
8179,17,louisiana,8179,The Nature Conservancy also owns and manages a range of natural areas.
8180,17,louisiana,8180,"The Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System provides a degree of protection for 51 rivers, streams and bayous in the state."
8181,17,louisiana,8181,It is administered by Louisiana's Wildlife and Fishing Department.
8182,17,louisiana,8182," Louisiana has 308 incorporated municipalities, consisting of four consolidated parish towns and 304 cities, towns and villages."
8183,17,louisiana,8183," Louisiana's municipalities account for only 7.9% of the state's land mass, but account for 45.3% of its population."

8273,17,louisiana,8273,The Louisiana economy and its policy of the last half century cannot be understood without taking full account of the influence of the oil and gas industries.
8274,17,louisiana,8274,"For example, in the 1970s, more than 40 per cent of Louisiana's revenues came directly from mining taxes and royalties."
8275,17,louisiana,8275," Since the 1980s, the head office of these industries has been consolidated in Houston, but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the Gulf of Mexico's crude oil and gas industry remain in Louisiana."

8278,17,louisiana,8278," Louisiana is home to many, especially notable are the culture distinct from the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of colour, descendants of mixed free families from the colonial and early states."
8279,17,louisiana,8279,The French colony of La Louisiana struggled for decades to survive.
8280,17,louisiana,8280,"The conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops that settlers knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281, Both settlers and the slaves they import have high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"Settlers continued to import slaves, resulting in a high proportion of West Africans who continued to practice their culture in new environments."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall described, they developed an African-Creole culture marked in colonial times."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a significant influx of white and Métis refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285," This added another infusion of African culture to the city, because more slaves in Santo Domingo were from Africa than in the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286," They have strongly influenced the city's Afro-American culture in terms of dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is a fusion of French, African, Spanish (and other European) and Amerindian cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word crioulo; originally it referred to a colonist of European origin (specifically French) born in the New World, compared with immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289," Louisiana's earliest manuscript to use the word ""Creole"" from 1782 applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,But he originally referred more generally to French settlers born in Louisiana.
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, a relatively large group of Creoles de Couleur (free coloured people) developed in the French colony, mainly from African women slaves and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans)."
8292,17,louisiana,8292," Often, the French freed their concubines and Métis children and passed on social capital to them."
8293,17,louisiana,8293,"For example, they could educate their sons in France and help them enter the French army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294, They also install goods or property on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295,People free of colour have gained more rights in the colony and sometimes in education
8296,17,louisiana,8296, Many became artisans and real estate owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""Creole"" became associated with this class of Colour Creoles, many of which gained freedom well before the civil war."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,Rich French Creoles have generally maintained city houses in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside the city along the Mississippi River.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans had the largest population of colour free people in the region; they could find work and create their own culture, marrying each other for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"The ancestors of the Cajuns migrated mainly from western central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally known as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301," After the British defeat of France in the French and Indian War (seven-year war) in 1763, France gave up its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated the families and expelled them from Acadia because they refused to offer loyalty to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304," Some, who fled the British, stayed in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305," Others scattered in France, Canada, Mexico and the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306," Many Acadian refugees settled in southern Louisiana, Lafayette and LaFourche Bayou."
8307,17,louisiana,8307," They developed a separate rural culture, different from the French Creole settlers of New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"By marrying others in the area, they developed what was known as Cajun music, cooking and culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309," Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered somewhat derogatory."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,A third culture distinct from Louisiana is that of l'Isleños.
8311,17,louisiana,8311," Its members were descendants of settlers from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and married other communities such as the French, Acadians, Creoles, Spaniards and other groups, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, Isleños originally settled in four communities including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313," Among these colonies, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most prosperous, the other two suffering from disease and flooding."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) was able to retain much of its unique culture and language in the 21st century.
8315,17,louisiana,8315," That being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs completely stopped in St. Bernard with those who have the competence in Spanish being octagenary."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Over the centuries, the various communities of Isleño de Louisiana have kept alive various elements of their heritage of the Canary Islands while adopting and relying on the customs and traditions of the communities around them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317," Today, two heritage partners exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard and the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana."
8318,17,louisiana,8318,"The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated every year in the parish of Saint-Bernard, which features heritage performances by local groups and the Canary Islands."
8319,17,louisiana,8319," According to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among people aged five and over, 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% French (standard French, French Creole or French Cajun), 3.30% Spanish and 0.59% Vietnamese."
8320,17,louisiana,8320," Historically, the Amerindian peoples of the region at the time of the European meeting were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321," Among them, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have live native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322," Other Amerindian peoples have migrated to the region, escaping from Eastern European pressure."
8323,17,louisiana,8323," Among them were the people of Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati and Ofo."
8324,17,louisiana,8324,"As early as the 1700s, the French settlers began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans."
8325,17,louisiana,8325, They have created French-language and cultural institutions.
8326,17,louisiana,8326," They import thousands of slaves from West African tribes, who speak several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the process of Creolization, the slaves developed a Creole dialect of Louisiana integrating both French and African forms, which the colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, in particular, who spoke the Creole French Louisiana."
8329,17,louisiana,8329,"In the 19th century after the purchase of Louisiana by the United States, English gradually became more important for business and government due to the evolution of the population with the establishment of many English-speaking Americans."
8330,17,louisiana,8330, Many ethnic French-speaking families continued to use French in private.
8331,17,louisiana,8331,The slaves and some free people of colour also spoke the Creole French of Louisiana.
8332,17,louisiana,8332,"The 1812 Constitution of the State confers official status on English in judicial proceedings, but the use of French remains widespread."
8333,17,louisiana,8333,The subsequent constitutions reflect the decreasing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The Constitution of 1868, adopted at the time of the reconstruction prior to the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, prohibits laws requiring the publication of judicial proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335," Subsequently, the legal status of the French recovered somewhat, but it never returned to its place before the civil war."
8336,17,louisiana,8336," Several unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana."
8337,17,louisiana,8337,The dialects of the French language are: colonial French and Houma French.
8338,17,louisiana,8338, Louisiana Creole French is the term for one of the Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339," Two unique dialects developed from the English language: Louisiana English, a variety of English with French influence in which the fall of /r/ postvocalism is common; and what is unofficially known as Yat, which resembles the New York City dialect sometimes with southern influences, especially that of historic Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340," Both accents were influenced by large communities of Irish and Italian immigrants, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341, Colonial French was the dominant language of white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period.
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, the Métis people and the slaves developed Creole Louisiana, with a base in West African languages."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish domination at the end of the eighteenth century did not lead to the widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"The French Creole and Louisiana are still used in modern Louisiana, often in family gatherings."
8345,17,louisiana,8345,"English and associated dialects became predominant after the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, after which the area became dominated by many Anglophones."
8346,17,louisiana,8346,"In some areas, English is influenced by French, as is the case for Louisiana English."
8347,17,louisiana,8347," Colonial French, although wrongly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, persisted alongside English."
8348,17,louisiana,8348,"The renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana led to the creation of Canadian-style French immersion schools, as well as bilingual signage in the French historic neighbourhoods of New Orleans and Lafayette."
8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, the State has maintained since 1968 the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which promotes the use of the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations of the State."

8360,17,louisiana,8360,"Danielle Dreilinger of the Times Picayune wrote in 2014 that ""Louisiana parents have a national reputation for promoting private schools."""
8361,17,louisiana,8361,"The number of students enrolled in private schools in Louisiana declined by 9% between 2000-2005 and 2014, due to the proliferation of charter schools, the 2008 recession and Hurricane Katrina."
8362,17,louisiana,8362,Ten parishes in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans region recorded a combined drop of 17% in private school enrolment during this period.
8363,17,louisiana,8363, This prompted private schools to lobby for school vouchers.
8364,17,louisiana,8364,The Louisiana Scholarship Program is known as the Louisiana Scholarship Program.
8365,17,louisiana,8365,It was available in the New Orleans region from 2008 onwards and in the rest of the state from 2012.

8387,17,louisiana,8387, Louisiana's political and legal structure has maintained several elements of the French and Spanish governance era.
8388,17,louisiana,8388,"One is the use of the term ""parish"" (from French: Parish) instead of ""county"" for the administrative subdivision."
8389,17,louisiana,8389," Another is the legal system of civil law based on the French, German and Spanish legal codes, and finally Roman law, as opposed to English common law."
8390,17,louisiana,8390," Louisiana's civil law system is what most of the nations of the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, to the exclusion of those resulting from the British Empire."
8391,17,louisiana,8391," However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the Napoleonic Code."
8392,17,louisiana,8392," Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law derive their common legal origin, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803."
8393,17,louisiana,8393," Although the Civil Code of Louisiana of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its promulgation, it is still considered the supervisory authority in the state."
8394,17,louisiana,8394, There are differences between the civil law of Louisiana and the common law of other American states.

8415,17,louisiana,8415," This method of refoulement does not take account of the party's identification, so it is not uncommon for a democrat to be in a refoulement with a democrat or a republican to be in a refoulement with a republican."

8912,19,maryland,8912,"But the grant indicated that Charles II and William Penn assumed that the 40th parallel would pass near New Castle, Delaware when he fell north of Philadelphia, the site that Penn had already chosen for the capital of his colony."

8914,19,maryland,8914,A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682 was undermined by the fact that Penn received the additional award of what is now Delaware.

8956,19,maryland,8956," After the reconstruction ended in 1877, the Democrats designed ways to deprive blacks of their right to vote, first through physical intimidation and electoral fraud, then through constitutional amendments and laws."

8969,19,maryland,8969,The progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries has led to political reforms.
8970,19,maryland,8970,"In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by parties); obtained closed polling stations to prevent party workers from assisting voters; launched primary elections to prevent party bosses from selecting candidates; and had registered candidates without party symbols, which discouraged illiterates from participating."
8971,19,maryland,8971, These measures worked against poorly educated whites and blacks.
8972,19,maryland,8972,"The Blacks resisted such efforts, with groups of votes leading the education of voters.The Blacks defeated three efforts to refuse them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various democratic campaigns."

8989,19,maryland,8989," Beginning in the 1960s, while suburban growth began around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to adopt a more mid-Atlantic culture, unlike the traditional southern and tidewater culture that once dominated most of the state."
8990,19,maryland,8990," Agricultural sectors have given way to residential communities, some of which have been carefully planned, such as Columbia, St. Charles and Montgomery Village."

8998,19,maryland,8998,"In an effort to reverse the depopulation caused by the loss of workers' industries, Baltimore launched urban renewal projects in the 1960s with Charles Center and the Baltimore World Trade Center."
8999,19,maryland,8999," Some have led to the disintegration of intact residential neighbourhoods, resulting in social volatility, and some older residential neighbourhoods around the harbour have had renovated housing and become popular with new populations."
9000,19,maryland,9000,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates Maryland's population as at 1 July 2019 was 6,045,680, an increase of 4.71% over the 2010 U.S. census and 2,962 over the previous year."
9001,19,maryland,9001," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 269,166 (464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people to the State."

10743,23,mississippi,10743," Due to seasonal flooding from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744,"The flood of the river created natural dikes, which the planters had built earlier to try to prevent the flooding of cultivated land for cotton crops."
10745,23,mississippi,10745, Temporary workers built dikes along the Mississippi River above the natural dikes that formed from the land deposited after the flood of the river.
10746,23,mississippi,10746," From 1858 to 1861, the state took over the dyke building, performing it through contractors and labour hires."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to be hired for such dangerous work."
10748,23,mississippi,10748, Entrepreneurs have hired Irish immigrant gangs to build dykes and sometimes cleared land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749, Many Irish were relatively recent immigrants of years of famine who had difficulty settling.
10750,23,mississippi,10750," Prior to the U.S. Civil War, the average height of the dykes was six feet, although in some areas they reached twenty feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751," Floods have been an integral part of Mississippi's history, but clearing land for cultivation and wood supply for steamboats has removed tree absorption and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river were bare, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753," After the civil war, major floods ravaged the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874, and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754," These floods regularly submerged the dikes damaged by the Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those built after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created Mississippi Levee District for the southern counties."

10757,23,mississippi,10757,"At the end of the 19th century, temporary white and black workers were hired to build the dykes."
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"In 1882 the dikes had an average height of seven feet, but many in the southern delta were severely tested by flooding that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759," After the flood of 1882, the system of dykes was expanded."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the district of Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee was established to oversee the construction and maintenance of dykes in the northern counties of the delta, and included some Arkansas counties that were part of the delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761," Floods submerged the northwest of Mississippi in 1912-13, causing heavy damage to the dikes districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,The regional losses and lobbying of the Mississippi River Levee Association for a flood control bill contributed to the passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide matching federal funds for local dykes districts on a scale of 2:1.
10763,23,mississippi,10763," Although U.S. participation in the First World War interrupted the financing of the dykes, the second round of funding raised the average height of the dykes in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764, Scientists now understand that dykes have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow rate of the river and reducing the area of floodplains.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The area was severely damaged by the Mississippi floods in 1927, which crossed the dykes."
10766,23,mississippi,10766," There have been losses of millions of dollars in property, inventory and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The greatest damage occurred in the lower delta, including the counties of Washington and Bolivar."
10768,23,mississippi,10768," Although scientific knowledge of Mississippi has increased, upstream development and the consequences of dykes have led to more severe flooding in some years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769, Scientists now understand that widespread land clearing and dam construction have changed the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770," This work has removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, thus strengthening the flow of the river."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The federal and state governments have struggled for the best approaches to restoring certain natural habitats in order to better interact with the original riparian ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772," Nearly 10,000 Native Americans or Paleo-Indians from BC have arrived in what is now called the American South."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,"In the South, Paleo-Indians are hunter-gatherers who pursue the megafauna that died after the end of the Pleistocene age."
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Amerindian colonies and agricultural fields were built on the natural dikes, a higher land near the rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Amerindians developed large fields near their permanent villages.
10776,23,mississippi,10776," Along with other practices, they have created localized deforestation, but they have not altered the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777," After thousands of years, the successive cultures of the Wood Age and Mississippi have developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which the surplus has supported the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778, Both were mound builders' cultures.
10779,23,mississippi,10779," Those in Mississippi culture were the largest and most complex, built from about 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,People had a commercial network that extended across the Great Lakes continent to the Gulf coast.

10782,23,mississippi,10782,Amerindian tribes that descend from Mississippi culture in the southeast include Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783," Other tribes that inhabited Mississippi (and whose names were honoured by settlers in local cities) include Natchez, Yazoo and Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who crossed the northeastern part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French settlers established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built near current ocean sources on the Gulf coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was established by Pierre Le Moyne of Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,"In 1716, the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (as Fort Rosalie); it became the dominant town and trading post of the region."
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the largest territory ""New France""; the Spaniards continued to claim part of the Gulf Coast area (east of Mobile Bay) of the current South Alabama, in addition to the entire area of Florida today."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"In the 18th century, the region was ruled by various Spanish, French and British colonial governments."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,Settlers imported African slaves as workers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791," Under the French and Spanish rule, he developed a class of free people of colour (people of free colour), mainly multiracial descendants of European men and black women slaves or free, and their Métis children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,"In the early days, the French and Spanish settlers were mainly men."
10793,23,mississippi,10793," While more and more European women have joined the colonies, men have race unions between women of African descent (and increasingly of multiracial ancestry), before and after the marriage of European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"European men often help their multiracial children to learn or acquire apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes settle on them; they often free mothers and their children if they are slaves, under placarding contracts."
10795,23,mississippi,10795," With this social capital, the people free of colour have become artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and real estate owners, forming a third class between Europeans and the most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish colonies, although less a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796," After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (seven-year war), the French handed over the Mississippi region to them under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797," They also ceded their areas to the north, east of Mississippi, including Illinois and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798," After the Peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi fell under Spanish domination as part of Western Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819, the United States completed the purchase of Western Florida and all Eastern Florida in the Adams-Onís Treaty, and in 1822 the two were merged into Florida territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800," After the American Revolution (1765-1783), Britain gave this region to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801,"The Mississippi Territory was organized on April 7, 1798, from the territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States."
10802,23,mississippi,10802, Their original colonial charters extended theoretically westward to the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803," Later, the territory of Mississippi was extended twice to include the disputed territory claimed by the United States and Spain."
10804,23,mississippi,10804," From 1800 to 1830, the United States purchased land (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Amerindian tribes for new European American colonies."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mainly migrants from other southern states, especially Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were depleted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,"New settlers continued to invade the lands of Choctaw, and they urged the federal government to expel the Amerindians."
10807,23,mississippi,10807,"On September 27, 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the U.S. government and the Choctaw."
10808,23,mississippi,10808,The Choctaws agreed to sell their traditional lands in Mississippi and Alabama for compensation and removal of reserves in Indian territory (now Oklahoma).
10809,23,mississippi,10809, This has opened up land for sale to the establishment of Euro-American migrants.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 of the Treaty allows Choctaws who choose to remain in states to become American citizens, as they are considered to abandon their tribal affiliation."
10811,23,mississippi,10811," They were the second American Aboriginal ethnic group to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas instead of joining the kidnapping)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812," Today, their descendants include approximately 9,500 people who identify themselves as Choctaw, and who live in Nechoba, Newton, Leake and Jones counties."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band reorganized in the 20th century and is a tribe recognized by the federal government.
10814,23,mississippi,10814," Many slave owners brought enslaved African Americans with them or bought them through the slave trade, especially in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"As a result of this trade, it is estimated that nearly one million slaves were forcibly transported to the deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke many families of Upper South slaves, where planters were selling surplus slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816,The Southerners imposed laws on slaves in the deep south and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817," From 1822, Mississippi slaves were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishments by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,"In most cases, slave codes in the South have made it illegal for a slave to be killed voluntarily."
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, in Mississippi 1860, Oliver v. State accused the accused of killing his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820,The Mississippi became the 20th state on 10 December 1817.
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes was the first Governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as ancestral land by several Amerindian tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823," Plantations were developed mainly along the main rivers, where the seafront provided access to the main transport routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"It is also where the first cities develop, connected by steamboats that transport commercial products and crops to the markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The rest of the Amerindian ancestral lands remained largely untapped, but were sold by treaty until 1826 when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826," Following the abolition of the Choctaw Tribal Government by the state legislature of Mississippi in 1829, the Indian Abduction Act of President Andrew Jackson and the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek of 1830, the Choctaws were forced to sell their lands and were transported to Oklahoma territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, as well as other southeastern tribes abducted as a result of the law, has become known as the Tears Trail."
10828,23,mississippi,10828," When cotton was king in the 1850s, the owners of Mississippi plantations – especially those in the central Delta and black belt regions – became rich because of the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market and the free labour acquired thanks to their African-American enslavement outfit."
10829,23,mississippi,10829, They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830, Planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for work and serious wealth imbalances among whites have played an important role both in state policy and in supporting planters for secession.
10831,23,mississippi,10831," Mississippi is a slave society, whose economy depends on slavery."
10832,23,mississippi,10832,"The state was sparsely populated, with the population concentrated in riparian areas and cities."
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"In 1860, the enslaved Afro-American population numbered 436,631, representing 55 per cent of the total of 791,305 persons in the State."
10834,23,mississippi,10834," Less than 1,000 people were free of color."
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively small population of the State prior to the civil war reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the banks of the river, which formed the main transport corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836, Ninety per cent of the delta's bottom land was still at the border and was not developed.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The state needed much more settlers for development.
10838,23,mississippi,10838,The lands farther from the rivers were cleared by liberated men and white migrants during reconstruction and later.
10839,23,mississippi,10839,"On 9 January 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union and was one of the founding members of the Confederate States."
10840,23,mississippi,10840,The first six states to separate are those with the largest numbers of slaves.

11325,24,missouri,11325,"In Neosho, Missouri, Jackson called the state legislature in session to ask for secession."
11326,24,missouri,11326," However, the elected legislature was divided between pro-Union and pro-Confederate."
11327,24,missouri,11327,"As such, few pro-unionists attended the meeting called in Neosho, and the secession order was quickly passed."
11328,24,missouri,11328,The Confederation recognized the secession of Missouri on 30 October 1861.
11329,24,missouri,11329,"The elected governor being absent from the capital and the widely dispersed legislators, the state convention was assembled with most of its members present, except twenty who fled south with Jackson's forces."
11330,24,missouri,11330,The convention declared all the offices vacant and installed Hamilton Gamble as the new Governor of Missouri.

11332,24,missouri,11332,The federal government's decision has increased the pro-Union militia forces for service within the state and the voluntary regiments for the Union Army.
11333,24,missouri,11333, Fighting ensued between Union forces and a combined army of General Price's Missouri State Guard and Confederate troops from Arkansas and Texas under the leadership of General Ben McCulloch.

11335,24,missouri,11335," Although regular Confederate troops organized large-scale raids in Missouri, fighting in the state for the next three years consisted mainly of guerrilla warfare."
11336,24,missouri,11336,"""Citizen soldiers"" or insurgents such as Captain William Quantrill, Frank and Jesse James, brothers Younger and William T. Anderson used quick and small unit tactics."
11337,24,missouri,11337,"Initiated by the Missouri Party Rangers, these insurrections also arose in parts of the Union-occupied Confederation during the civil war."
11338,24,missouri,11338," Historians have portrayed stories from the outlaw years of the James brothers as an American myth ""Robin Hood""."
11339,24,missouri,11339,"The activities of the Bald Knobbers of the Ozarks in the 1880s were an informal continuation of the insurgent mentality long after the official end of the war, and they are a favorite theme in Branson's image."
11340,24,missouri,11340,"The progressive era (1890-1920) saw many prominent leaders of Missouri trying to end corruption and modernize politics, government and society."
11341,24,missouri,11341,"Joseph ""Saint Joe"" Folk was a key leader who made a strong appeal to the middle class and evangelical rural Protestants."
11342,24,missouri,11342, Folk was elected governor as a reformer and progressive democrat in the 1904 election.
11343,24,missouri,11343,"He promoted what he called ""the idea of Missouri"", the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of the law and strict application."
11344,24,missouri,11344,"He successfully pursued antitrust prosecutions, ended the freedom of railway passes for state officials, expanded corruption laws, improved electoral laws, required the official registration of lobbyists, made the race track game illegal and enforced Sunday's closing law."

11348,24,missouri,11348,The expansion of the railways to the west has transformed Kansas City into a major transportation centre within the nation.
11349,24,missouri,11349,"The growth of the Texas cattle industry as well as the increase in rail infrastructure and the invention of the cold car also made Kansas City a major meat packaging centre, while large Texas cattle roads brought livestock herds to Dodge City and other Kansas cities."
11350,24,missouri,11350," There, the cattle were loaded into trains destined for Kansas City, where they were massacred and distributed to the eastern markets."

11360,24,missouri,11360,"A grand jury refused to charge the officer, and the U.S. Department of Justice concluded, after a thorough investigation, that the police officer was legitimately afraid for his safety."
11361,24,missouri,11361," However, in a separate investigation, the Ministry of Justice also found that the Ferguson Police Department and the city of Ferguson relied on unconstitutional practices to balance the city's budget with racially motivated fines and excessive sanctions, that the Ferguson police ""used excessive and dangerous force and disproportionately targeted blacks"", and that the municipal court ""emphasized revenues to the detriment of public security, resulting in systematic violations of constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law""."

11376,24,missouri,11376," Although it is now generally considered to be part of the Midwest, Missouri has always been regarded by many as a border state, mainly because of the establishment of migrants from the South and its status as a slave state before the civil war, balanced by the influence of Saint-Louis."

11652,25,montana,11652,"It is bordered by Idaho to the west; North Dakota and South Dakota to the east; Wyoming to the south; and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan to the north."
11653,25,montana,11653,"It is the fourth largest state per region, the eighth least populated and the third least dense."
11654,25,montana,11654,"The western half of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges, while half is characterized by prairie terrain and western badlands, with more (although smaller) mountain ranges throughout the state."
11655,25,montana,11655,A total of 77 named chains are in the Rocky Mountains.
11656,25,montana,11656," Montana has no official nickname, but several unofficial names, including ""Big Sky Country"", ""The Treasure State"", ""Land of the Shining Mountains"", and ""The Last Best Place""."
11657,25,montana,11657,"The economy is based primarily on agriculture, including livestock and cereals."

11660,25,montana,11660,"The fastest growing area in Montana is tourism; nearly 13 million tourists per year visit Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Beartooth Highway, Flathead Lake, Big Sky Resort and other attractions."
11661,25,montana,11661,"The name Montana comes from the Spanish word montaña, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, meaning ""mountain"" or more widely ""mountainous country""."
11662,25,montana,11662,Montaña del Norte was the name given by the first Spanish explorers to the whole western mountainous region.
11663,25,montana,11663,The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill of the United States House Committee on Territories (then chaired by James Ashley of Ohio) for the territory that was to become the territory of Idaho.
11664,25,montana,11664,"The name was changed by representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained Montana had ""no meaning""."
11665,25,montana,11665," When Ashley introduced a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be dug out of Idaho, he again chose the territory of Montana."
11666,25,montana,11666," This time, Rep. Samuel Cox, also from Ohio, opposed the name."
11667,25,montana,11667,Cox complained that the name was a bad name because most of the territory was not mountainous and an Amerindian name would be more appropriate than a Spanish name.
11668,25,montana,11668," Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but the Territorial Committee decided that they could appoint it as they wished, so that the original name of Montana was adopted."

11674,25,montana,11674,"The topography of the State is roughly defined by the continental divide, which divides much of the State into distinct regions of the east and west."
11675,25,montana,11675," Most of the hundreds or more of Montana's mountain ranges are in the western half of the state, most of which are geologically and geographically located in the northern Rocky Mountains."
11676,25,montana,11676,The Absaroka and Beartooth chains in the south-central part of the State are technically part of the central Rocky Mountains.
11677,25,montana,11677,The Rocky Mountain Front is an important feature of the north-central part of the state and of isolated island chains that interrupt the common prairie landscape in the central and eastern parts of the state.
11678,25,montana,11678," About 60 per cent of the state is a prairie, which is part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains, one of the longest continuous chains of the Alaska Mountain Range in Mexico, as well as smaller chains, including the Alene Heart Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the Idaho State."

11682,25,montana,11682,"The northern section of the ditch, where the mountains quickly give way to the prairies, is part of the Rocky Mountain Front."
11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is more pronounced in the Lewis Range, located primarily in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684," Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (starting on the Seward Peninsula in Alaska) crosses this area and turns east into Montana at Triple Divide Peak."

11701,25,montana,11701,"The foothill regions are often covered with broken stones or slates or bare rocks (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil of the intermountainous basins generally consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt and volcanic ash, most of which consists of lakes that covered the area during the oligocene 33-23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"The trays are often covered with argillite gravel and used quartzite, sometimes under the shale."
11704,25,montana,11704,"The glaciated plains are generally covered with clay, gravel, sand and silt left by Great Falls Proglacial Lake or by moraines or ancient gravel-covered lake basins left by Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago."

11782,25,montana,11782, Cold winter spells are usually the result of cold continental air coming from southern Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The front is often well defined, resulting in a sharp drop in temperature within 24 hours."
11784,25,montana,11784," Conversely, the southwestern airflow translates into ""chinooks""."
11785,25,montana,11785," These steady winds from 25 to 50 mph (40 to 80 km/h) (or more) can suddenly warm up parts of Montana, especially areas just east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise to 50 to 60 degrees F (10 to 15.6 degrees Celsius) for 10 days or more."

11791,25,montana,11791,"On the east side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches (291 mm) and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation."
11792,25,montana,11792,"The mountains can receive more than 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the glacier Grinnell in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches (2,700 mm)."
11793,25,montana,11793,An area southwest of Belfry averaged 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a period of 16 years.

11799,25,montana,11799," Several cities in Montana recorded record heat in July 2007, the warmest month ever recorded in Montana."
11800,25,montana,11800,"Winters are warmer, too, and have less cold spells."
11801,25,montana,11801," Previously, these cold spells had killed the beetles, but they are now attacking the forests of western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the area allowed various species to expand their range and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, beetle attacks and poor management resulted in a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804," According to a study by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some parts of Montana will experience a 200 per cent increase in the area burned by forest fires and an 80 per cent increase in air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below shows average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month for the seven largest cities in Montana.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on the location, although the figures are similar overall."
11807,25,montana,11807, Montana is one of only two contiguous states (with Colorado) that are antipodal on land.
11808,25,montana,11808,The Kerguelen Islands are antipodes of the Montana-Saskatchewan-Alberta border.
11809,25,montana,11809,"No city is exactly antipodal in Kerguelen, although Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples have lived in the territory of the present state of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811," Historical tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers in the United States included the Crow in the south-central, Cheyenne in the south-east, Blackfeet, Assiniboine, and Gros Ventres in the north-central and central, and Kootenai and Salish in the west."
11812,25,montana,11812,"The smallest tribes of Pend d'Oreille and Kalispel lived near Flathead Lake and western mountains, respectively."
11813,25,montana,11813,A portion of southeastern Montana was used as a corridor between the Crows and the associated Hidatsas in North Dakota.
11814,25,montana,11814,The lands of Montana to the east of the continental divide were part of the purchase of Louisiana in 1803.
11815,25,montana,11815," Subsequently, and particularly in the decades following the Lewis and Clark expeditions, American, British and French traders operated a fur trade, usually working with indigenous peoples, in the eastern and western parts of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816," These transactions have not always been peaceful, and although the fur trade has brought material gain to indigenous tribal groups, it has also exposed European diseases and changed their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The Fort Raymond trading post (1807-1811) was built in the Indian state of Crow in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818," Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), lands west of the continental division were contested between the British and the United States and were known as Oregon countries."
11819,25,montana,11819,The first permanent establishment by the Euro-Americans in today's Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near Stevensville today.
11820,25,montana,11820,In 1847 Fort Benton was established as the highest fur trading post on the Missouri River.
11821,25,montana,11821,"In the 1850s, settlers began to settle in the Beaverhead and Big Hole valleys from the Oregon Trail and the Clark Forks Valley."
11822,25,montana,11822,"The first gold discovered in Montana was in Gold Creek, near the present garrison in 1852."
11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of important mining discoveries in the western third of the state from 1862 onward found gold, silver, copper, lead and coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area."
11824,25,montana,11824,"The richest of all gold placer excavations was found in Alder Gulch, where the city of Virginia City was established."
11825,25,montana,11825," Other rich placer deposits have been found in Last Chance Gulch, where the city of Helen, Confederate Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City is now located."
11826,25,montana,11826,Gold production between 1862 and 1876 reached $144 million.
11827,25,montana,11827,"The largest mining operations were in the town of Butte, which had large deposits of silver and huge copper deposits."
11828,25,montana,11828," Prior to the creation of the Montana Territory (1864–89), the current Montana regions were part of the Oregon Territory (1848–59), Washington Territory (1853–63), Idaho Territory (1863–64) and Dakota Territory (1861–64)."
11829,25,montana,11829," Montana became the territory of the United States (Territory of Montana) on May 26, 1864."
11830,25,montana,11830,The first territorial capital is located in Bannack.
11831,25,montana,11831,The first territorial governor is Sidney Edgarton.
11832,25,montana,11832,The capital settled in Virginia City in 1865 and Helena in 1875.
11833,25,montana,11833,"In 1870, the non-Indian population of the territory of Montana was 20,595."
11834,25,montana,11834,"The Montana Historical Society, founded on February 2, 1865 in Virginia City, is the oldest institution of its kind west of Mississippi (excluding Louisiana)."
11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870 respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and Washburn–Langford–Doane expeditions were launched from Helen to the Upper Yellowstone area and led directly to the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As the settlers began to populate Montana from the 1850s to the 1870s, disputes ensued with the Amerindians, mainly over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, the territorial governor of Washington, Isaac Stevens, negotiated the Hellgate Treaty between the U.S. government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai of western Montana, which established the boundaries of tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838, This Treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839," While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reserve, the difficulty with the interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led the whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was open to colonization, but the tribal nations challenged these provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first U.S. Army post in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect the traffic of steamboats going to Fort Benton."
11842,25,montana,11842,More than a dozen additional military outposts have been established in the State.
11843,25,montana,11843, Pressure on land ownership and control has increased as a result of gold discoveries in various regions of Montana and surrounding states.
11844,25,montana,11844,"Great battles took place in Montana during the Red Cloud War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, the Noz Perce War, and in conflicts with Piegan Blackfeet."
11845,25,montana,11845,"The most notable were the massacre of Marias (1870), the Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), the Battle of the Great Trou (1877) and the Battle of Bear Paw (1877)."
11846,25,montana,11846,The last conflict in Montana between the American army and the Amerindians occurred in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in Big Horn's country.
11847,25,montana,11847,Indian survivors who have signed treaties are generally required to enter the reserve.
11848,25,montana,11848," Along with these conflicts, bison, a key arch species and the main source of proteins on which Aboriginal people had survived for centuries, were destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849," According to some estimates, more than 13 million bison were found in Montana in 1870."
11850,25,montana,11850,"In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded for a joint session of Congress to authorize the slaughter of herds to deprive the Indians of their food source."
11851,25,montana,11851,"In 1884, commercial hunting had led the bison to the brink of extinction; only 325 bison remained in the United States."
11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle farming is at the heart of Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and exchanged fattened cattle in the fertile valleys of Montana with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.
11853,25,montana,11853,Nelson Story introduced Texas Longhorn's first cattle into the territory in 1866.
11854,25,montana,11854,"Granville Stuart, Samuel Hauser and Andrew J. Davis began a major open-area operation in Fergus County in 1879."
11855,25,montana,11855,The Ranch Grant-Kohrs National Historic Site at Deer Lodge is now maintained as a link to the late 19th-century breeding style.
11856,25,montana,11856," Managed by the National Parks Service, it is a 1,900-acre ranch (7.7 km2)."
11857,25,montana,11857,Northern Pacific Railroad (NPR) tracks reached Montana from west in 1881 and east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858," However, in the 1870s, the railway played an important role in tensions with the Amerindian tribes."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, president of the NPR, launched important surveys in the Yellowstone Valley in 1871, 1872 and 1873, which the Sioux strongly contested under the leadership of Chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860," These clashes, in part, contributed to the panic of 1873, a financial crisis which delayed the construction of the railway in Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"Surveys carried out in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped trigger the Great Sioux War of 1876."
11862,25,montana,11862,"The transcontinental RPN was completed on September 8, 1883, at Gold Creek."
11863,25,montana,11863,"The Great Northern Railway (GNR) tracks reached the east of Montana in 1887, and when they reached the north of the Rocky Mountains in 1890, the GNR became a major tourism promoter in the Glacier National Park area."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893 at Scenic, Washington."
11865,25,montana,11865,"In 1881, the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch of the Union Pacific, completed a narrow line between northern Utah and Butte."
11866,25,montana,11866,"A number of smaller spur lines operated in Montana from 1881 to the 20th century, including the Oregon Short Line, Montana Railway, and Milwaukee Road."
11867,25,montana,11867," Under the authority of territorial governor Thomas Meagher, the Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a unsuccessful attempt to become a state."
11868,25,montana,11868,A second constitutional convention held in Helena in 1884 produced a Constitution ratified by 3:1 citizens of Montana in November 1884.
11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress only approved state status in Montana in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting state status in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington after the appropriate state constitutions had been drafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,In July 1889 the Montanians convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government.
11871,25,montana,11871,"On November 8, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana 41st state of union."
11872,25,montana,11872,The first state governor was Joseph K. Toole.
11873,25,montana,11873,In the 1880s Helena (the state capital) had more millionaires per capita than any other city in the United States.
11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land to settlers who could claim and ""proven"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875, Montana did not see a large influx of immigrants under the Act because 160 acres were usually insufficient to support a family in arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,"In 1868 David Carpenter, near Helen, made the first claim under the act of ownership in Montana."
11877,25,montana,11877,"The first claim of a woman was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana pioneer, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"In 1880, the farms were in the greenest valleys of central and western Montana, but few were on the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Lands Act of 1877 was passed to permit the establishment of dry lands in the west and awarded 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a $25 per acre right and a promise of irrigation of the land.
11880,25,montana,11880," After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would be owned by the colon."
11881,25,montana,11881," This law brought most of the cattle and sheep farmers to Montana, many of whom took their herds to the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land, and then abandoned it without paying the final fee."
11882,25,montana,11882," Some farmers arrived with the arrival of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railways in the 1880s and 1890s, although in relatively small numbers."
11883,25,montana,11883,"In the early 1900s James J. Hill, from the far north, began to promote the settlement on the Montana prairie to fill its trains with settlers and goods."
11884,25,montana,11884, Other railways followed the same path.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the Rehabilitation Act was passed, which resulted in the construction of irrigation projects in the eastern river valleys of Montana."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909, Congress passed the Expanded Houses Act, which extended the area of open land from 160 acres to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family, and in 1912 reduced the time to ""proven"" a claim to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Homesteads Act allowed 640 acres of homesteads in areas unsuitable for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888," This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of landowners, attracted to free land, with World War I bringing particularly high wheat prices."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana was experiencing a temporary period of higher than average rainfall."
11890,25,montana,11890,"The owners arriving at this period were called ""Honyockers"", or ""scissors""."
11891,25,montana,11891," Although the word ""honyocker"", perhaps derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisory way to the owners as ""green horns"", ""new to his business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had agricultural experience, although many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892," However, farmers face a number of challenges."
11893,25,montana,11893, That was a huge debt.
11894,25,montana,11894,"In addition, most settlers came from wetter areas, did not prepare for dry climate, lack of trees, and scarcity of water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small houses less than 320 acres (130 ha) were not suitable for the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896, Weather and agricultural conditions are much more difficult and drier to the west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897, Then the droughts of 1917-1921 proved devastating.
11898,25,montana,11898," Many people left, and half of the state's banks went bankrupt following the granting of mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, the size of the holdings has increased while the number of holdings has decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"In 1910, farmers made claims on more than five million acres, and in 1923, more than 93 million acres were cultivated."
11901,25,montana,11901,"In 1910, the Great Falls Land Office alone had more than a thousand deposits of property per month, and at the top of 1917-1918, it had 14,000 deposits per year."
11902,25,montana,11902, Significant decreases occurred as a result of the 1919 drought.
11903,25,montana,11903,"As the First World War broke out, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States declaration of war."
11904,25,montana,11904," His actions have been widely criticized in Montana, where support for war and patriotism have been strong."
11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917–2018, due to a miscalculation of the Montana population, approximately 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the state population, volunteered or were recruited into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906,It was a contribution of the labour force to war that was 25 per cent higher than that of any other per capita state.
11907,25,montana,11907," Approximately 1500 Montanans died as a result of the war and 2437 were injured, as well as more than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908," Montana's Remount station in Miles City provided 10,000 horse cavalry horses for the war, more than any other army post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for Montana's interests in mining, lumber and agriculture, as the demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the American Congress adopted the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the 1918 act of sedition."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Assembly of Montana passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912," Together, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, the military, or symbols by speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana Act led to the arrest of more than 200 people and the conviction of 78 people, mostly of German or Austrian origin."
11914,25,montana,11914,More than 40 people spent some time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, Governor Brian Schweitzer granted full posthumous pardons to all those convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed the entry of the United States into the war included groups of German and Irish immigrants, as well as pacifist anabaptists such as the Hutterites and the Mennonites, many of whom were also Germanic."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-war groups such as the Montana Defence Council, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and the local ""loyalty committees"" were formed."
11918,25,montana,11918,The feeling of war was complicated by work issues.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The Anaconda Copper Company, which was at its historic peak in copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and trade unions that were trying to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multi-ethnic community of major European immigrants, trade unions, in particular the newly formed Metal Mining Workers' Union, opposed the war on the grounds that they mainly benefited from important interests in the timber and mining sector."
11921,25,montana,11921," Following the explosion of mining production and the speculatory mine disaster in June 1917, Frank Little, a global organizer of industrial workers, arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave speeches with incendiary rhetoric against the war.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On August 1, 1917, he was dragged from his boarding school by masked vigilantes, and hanged on a railway lattice, considered a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,The murder of Little and the ensuing strikes led the National Guard to be sent to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925," Overall, anti-German and anti-labor sentiment has increased and created a movement that led to the adoption of the Montana Sedition Act the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Defence Council had been established as a State body empowered to prosecute and punish persons tried in violation of the law."
11927,25,montana,11927,The Council also adopted rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting German speaking in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"As a result of the legislative action of 1918, emotions increased."
11929,25,montana,11929,U.S. prosecutor Burton K. Wheeler and several district court judges who were reluctant to prosecute or sentence accused persons were strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930," Wheeler was brought before the Defence Council, although he avoided formal proceedings, and a judge of the Forsyth District Court was indicted."
11931,25,montana,11931, There were burns of German-speaking books and several near-hangings.
11932,25,montana,11932,The ban on German speaking remained in force at the beginning of the 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Compliing the struggles in times of war, the 1918 influenza epidemic cost the lives of more than 5,000 Montanas."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that occurred has led some historians to duplicate this period ""the agony of Montana""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after the First World War and lasted through the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936," This has caused a lot of difficulties for farmers, farmers and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937," Wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state an important producer; wheat has a relatively high protein content, which requires high prices."
11938,25,montana,11938,"At the time of the United States' entry into World War II on December 8, 1941, many Montanas had enlisted in the army to escape the poor national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Over 40,000 Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war, and more than 57,000 joined before the end of the war."
11940,25,montana,11940," These figures represented about ten per cent of the population of the state, and Montana again contributed to one of the highest per capita numbers of soldiers in any state."
11941,25,montana,11941," Many Amerindians were among those who served, including Crow Nation soldiers who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,"At least 1,500 Montanians died in the war."
11943,25,montana,11943,"The Montana was also the training ground of the First Special Service Force or ""Devil's Brigade"", an American commando-style joint force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for the experience of mountain and winter conditions prior to its deployment."
11944,25,montana,11944,"Air bases were built at Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank and Glasgow, some of which were used as assembly areas to prepare aircraft for Allied forces in the Soviet Union."
11945,25,montana,11945," During the war, about 30 Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs landed in Montana, but no casualties or major forest fires were attributed to them."
11946,25,montana,11946,"In 1940, Jeannette Rankin was again elected to Congress."
11947,25,montana,11947,"In 1941, as it had done in 1917, she voted against the United States declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
11948,25,montana,11948," His was the only vote against the war, and following a public outcry over his vote, Rankin demanded police protection for a while."
11949,25,montana,11949," Other pacifists tend to be those of the ""peace churches"" that were generally opposed to war."
11950,25,montana,11950, Many people claiming conscientious objector status from all over the United States were sent to Montana during the war as jumpers of smoke and for other tasks of fighting forest fires.
11951,25,montana,11951,"In 1942, the U.S. Army established Camp Rimini near Helen to train sled dogs in winter."
11952,25,montana,11952," During the Second World War, the planned USMontana warship was named in honor of the state, but it was never completed."
11953,25,montana,11953, Montana is the only one of the first 48 states that do not have a full warship to be named on its behalf.
11954,25,montana,11954, Both Alaska and Hawaii have nuclear submarines named after them.
11955,25,montana,11955, Montana is the only state of the union without a modern naval ship named in its honour.
11956,25,montana,11956," However, in August 2007, Senator Jon Tester asked for a submarine to be named US Montana."

12592,27,nevada,12592,New areas acquired by the United States continue to be administered as territories.
12593,27,nevada,12593,"In the framework of the Mexican Cessation (1848) and the California Gold Rush which then used Emigrant Trails across the region, the State region first evolved as part of the Utah Territory, then the Nevada Territory (2 March 1861; named in honour of the Sierra Nevada)."
12594,27,nevada,12594," See History of Utah, History of Las Vegas, and the discovery of the first major American silver ore deposit at Comstock Lode under Virginia City, Nevada, in 1859."
12595,27,nevada,12595,"On 2 March 1861 the territory of Nevada separated from the territory of Utah and adopted its present name, abbreviated from the Sierra Nevada (Spanish for ""snow-covered mountain ranges"")."
12596,27,nevada,12596,The southern boundary of 1861 is commemorated by the historic marks of Nevada 57 and 58 in Lincoln and Nye counties.
12597,27,nevada,12597," Eight days before the presidential election of 1864, Nevada became the 36th state of the Union, despite the absence of the minimum number of 60,000 residents required to become a state."
12598,27,nevada,12598,"(At the time, Nevada's population was just over 10,000.)"
12599,27,nevada,12599," Rather than sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27 – the most expensive telegraph on file at the time for a single shipment."
12600,27,nevada,12600," Finally, Washington's response came on October 31, 1864: ""The pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day has been admitted into the Union""."
12601,27,nevada,12601,"The state was rushed to 31 October to help secure the re-election of Abraham Lincoln on 8 November and Republican domination after the civil war in Congress, as the Nevada mining economy linked him to the more industrialized Union."
12602,27,nevada,12602,"As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the elections hand in hand and don't need Nevada's help."
12603,27,nevada,12603, Nevada is one of only two states to extend its borders considerably after its admission to the Union.
12604,27,nevada,12604,"(The other is Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 because of the purchase of the plaque.)"
12605,27,nevada,12605,"In 1866, another part of the western Utah territory was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the State, setting the current eastern boundary."
12606,27,nevada,12606," Nevada reached its present southern limits on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the part of Pah-Ute County in the Arizona territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of the present Nevada south of the 37th parallel."
12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was caused by the discovery of gold in the region, and officials thought that Nevada would be better able to monitor the expected demographic boom."
12608,27,nevada,12608, This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area.
12609,27,nevada,12609, Mining has shaped the Nevada economy for many years (see Silver Mining in Nevada).
12610,27,nevada,12610," When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It, mining led to an industry of speculation and huge wealth."
12611,27,nevada,12611, Mining and population declined temporarily in the late nineteenth century.
12612,27,nevada,12612," However, the rich silver strike in Tonopah in 1900, followed by strikes in Goldfield and Rhyolite, created a second mining boom in Nevada and the population of Nevada."
12613,27,nevada,12613,"Unregulated gambling was common in the first mining towns in Nevada, but was banned in 1909 as part of a national anti-gambling crusade."
12614,27,nevada,12614," Due to subsequent declines in mining production and the decline in the agricultural sector during the Great Depression, Nevada again legalized the game on March 19, 1931, with the approval of the Legislative Assembly."
12615,27,nevada,12615,The signature of Governor Fred B. Balzar promulgated the most liberal laws on divorce in the country and free play.
12616,27,nevada,12616,The reforms took place only eight days after the federal government introduced the $49 million construction contract for the Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam).
12617,27,nevada,12617,"The Nevada Test Site, located 105 km northwest of Las Vegas City, was founded on January 11, 1951 for nuclear weapons testing."
12618,27,nevada,12618,"The site consists of about 1,350 square kilometres (3,500 km2) of desert and mountainous terrain."
12619,27,nevada,12619," Nuclear tests at the Nevada test site began with a 1 kiloton TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951."
12620,27,nevada,12620,The last atmospheric test took place on 17 July 1962 and underground weapons testing continued until 23 September 1992.
12621,27,nevada,12621,The location is known to have the highest concentration of nuclear detonated weapons in the United States.
12622,27,nevada,12622,More than 80 per cent of the state area is owned by the federal government.
12623,27,nevada,12623,The main reason for this is that homesteads have not been allowed in size enough to be viable under the arid conditions prevailing throughout the Nevada desert.
12624,27,nevada,12624," Instead, the first settlers would house land surrounding a water source, and then graze cattle on adjacent public lands, which is unnecessary for agriculture without access to water (this farming pattern still prevails)."
12625,27,nevada,12625,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of Nevada was 3,080,156 as of July 1, 2019, an increase of 45,764 residents (1.51%) since the 2018 U.S. Census estimate and an increase of 379,605 residents (14.06 per cent) since the 2010 U.S. Census."
12626,27,nevada,12626, Nevada recorded the highest percentage of population growth between 2017 and 2018.
12627,27,nevada,12627,"As of the 2010 census, 6.9 per cent of the State population was under the age of 5, 24.6 per cent under the age of 18 and 12.0 per cent over the age of 65."
12628,27,nevada,12628,Women make up approximately 49.5 per cent of the population.
12629,27,nevada,12629," Since the 2010 census, the population of Nevada has seen a natural increase of 87,581 (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 inhabitants (of which 104,032 are due to internal migration and 42,594 are due to international migration)."
12630,27,nevada,12630,The Nevada Population Centre is located in southern Nye County.
12631,27,nevada,12631,"In this county, the unincorporated city of Pahrump, 97 km west of Las Vegas, on the California state line, grew very rapidly from 1980 to 2010."
12632,27,nevada,12632,"At the 2010 census, there were 36,441 residents in the city."
12633,27,nevada,12633," Las Vegas grew from a mulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1970 and was America's fastest growing city and metropolitan area from 1960 to 2000."
12634,27,nevada,12634," Between the 1940s and 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the United States."
12635,27,nevada,12635," Between 1990 and 2000, Nevada's population increased by 66 per cent, while the national population increased by 13 per cent."
12636,27,nevada,12636,"More than two thirds of the population live in Clark County, which is co-extensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12637,27,nevada,12637," Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the country's most centralized states."
12638,27,nevada,12638,"Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the fastest growing 20 cities in the United States with more than 100,000 inhabitants."
12639,27,nevada,12639,"The rural community of Mesquite, 105 km northeast of Las Vegas, was an example of micropolitical growth in the 1990s and 2000."
12640,27,nevada,12640, Other deserted cities such as Indian Springs and Searchlight on the outskirts of Las Vegas have also seen some growth.
12641,27,nevada,12641," Since 1950, the Nevada-born population rate has never exceeded 27 per cent, the lowest in all states."
12642,27,nevada,12642,"In 2012, only 25% of the Nevadas were born in the state."
12643,27,nevada,12643," Most of the new residents of Nevada have moved from California, which has led some Nevadas to feel that their condition is ""californed."""
12644,27,nevada,12644," According to the 2017 U.S. Community Survey, 28.2% of Nevada's population were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (21.4%), Puerto Rican (0.9%), Cuban (1.0%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (4.8%)."
12645,27,nevada,12645,"The five most important groups of non-Hispanic white ancestry were German (11.3%), Irish (9.0%), English (6.9%), Italian (5.8%) and American (4.7%)."
12646,27,nevada,12646,"In 1980, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 83.3% of the population of the state."
12647,27,nevada,12647,"In 2011, 63.6 per cent of the population of Nevada under the age of 1 were minorities."
12648,27,nevada,12648, Las Vegas is a minority majority city.
12649,27,nevada,12649," According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2018, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 48.7% of the Nevada population."

12651,27,nevada,12651,"In Nye County and Humboldt County, residents are mainly of German ancestry; Washoe County has many American Irish."
12652,27,nevada,12652," Americans of English ancestry form pluralities in Lincoln County, Churchill County, Lyon County, White Pine County and Eureka County."
12653,27,nevada,12653, Asian Americans had been living in the state since the California Gold Rush of the 1850s brought thousands of Chinese miners to Washoe County.
12654,27,nevada,12654, They were followed by a few hundred Japanese agricultural workers in the late 19th century.
12655,27,nevada,12655,"In the late 20th century, many immigrants from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India and Vietnam arrived in the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12656,27,nevada,12656,"The city now has one of the most prolific American Asian communities in America, with a predominantly Chinese and Taiwanese region known as ""Chinatown"" west of the I-15 on Spring Mountain Road."
12657,27,nevada,12657,"The American Filipinos are the largest American Asian group in the state, with a population of over 113,000."
12658,27,nevada,12658, They account for 56.5 per cent of the American Asian population of Nevada and about 4.3 per cent of the total population of the state.
12659,27,nevada,12659, Mining booms attracted many Greek and Eastern European immigrants to Nevada.
12660,27,nevada,12660,"The indigenous tribes of Nevada are Koso, Paiute, Panamint, Shoshoni, Walapi, Washoe and Ute tribes."
12661,27,nevada,12661,"Mexico (39.5 per cent of immigrants), the Philippines (14.3 per cent), El Salvador (5.2 per cent), China (3.1 per cent) and Cuba (3 per cent) were the main countries of origin of immigrants to Nevada."
12662,27,nevada,12662,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, with Hispanics counted both by ethnic origin and race, resulting in a higher overall number."
12663,27,nevada,12663,A small percentage of Nevada's population lives in rural areas.
12664,27,nevada,12664,The culture of these places differs considerably from the larger metropolitan areas.
12665,27,nevada,12665,"The inhabitants of these rural counties tend to be native residents of Nevada, unlike the Las Vegas and Reno regions, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state."
12666,27,nevada,12666,The rural population is also less diversified in terms of race and ethnicity.
12667,27,nevada,12667," Mining plays an important role in the economy of rural counties, as tourism is less prominent."
12668,27,nevada,12668,Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada.
12669,27,nevada,12669,Church attendance in Nevada is among the weakest of all American states.
12670,27,nevada,12670,"In a 2009 Gallup poll, only 30% of Nevadas reported that they attended the church every week or almost, compared with 42% of all Americans (it was found that only four states had a lower attendance rate than Nevada)."
12671,27,nevada,12671,"The main religious affiliations of the Nevada population are: Protestants 35 per cent, no religion 28 per cent, Roman Catholics 25 per cent, Saint of the last days 4 per cent, Jews 2 per cent, Hindus less than 1 per cent, Buddhists 0.5 per cent and Islam less than 0.1 per cent."

12675,27,nevada,12675," Nevada's economy is linked to tourism (especially recreation and gambling), mining and livestock farming."
12676,27,nevada,12676," Nevada's industrial products are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing and electrical equipment."
12677,27,nevada,12677,The Economic Analysis Bureau estimates that the total revenue from the state of Nevada in 2018 was $170 billion.
12678,27,nevada,12678,"The per capita personal income of the state in 2018 was $43,820, the 35th highest in the nation."
12679,27,nevada,12679,"The Government of Nevada's 2012 debt was calculated as $7.5 billion, or $3,100 per taxpayer."
12680,27,nevada,12680,"In December 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.8%."
12681,27,nevada,12681, Nevada's economy has long been linked to the vice-industries.
12682,27,nevada,12682,"""Nevada was] based on mining and re-founded on sin – starting with the fight against prices and easy divorce a century ago, then extending to gambling and prostitution,"" said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist."
12683,27,nevada,12683,"In some parts of the state outside the metropolitan areas of Las Vegas and Reno, mining plays a major economic role."
12684,27,nevada,12684,"In value, gold is by far the most important ore mined."
12685,27,nevada,12685,"In 2004, 6,800,000 ounces (1900,000,000 g) of gold worth $2.84 billion were extracted in Nevada and the state accounted for 8.7% of world gold production (see Gold Mining in Nevada)."
12686,27,nevada,12686,"Silver is a second distant, with 10,300,000 ounces (290,000 g) worth $69 million extracted in 2004 (see Silver mining in Nevada)."
12687,27,nevada,12687," Other Nevada minerals include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite, and lithium."
12688,27,nevada,12688," Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high, and production is very sensitive to world commodity prices."
12689,27,nevada,12689,Cattle farming is a major economic activity in the rural areas of Nevada.
12690,27,nevada,12690," Nevada's agricultural production is cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions and potatoes."
12691,27,nevada,12691,"As of 1 January 2006, there were about 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada."
12692,27,nevada,12692," Most of these animals feed on the routes in summer, with extra food in winter."
12693,27,nevada,12693,Calfs are usually shipped to out-of-state feedlots in the fall to be fattened for the market.
12694,27,nevada,12694,"More than 90% of the 484,000 acres of Nevada (196,000 ha) of cultivated land are used to grow hay, mainly alfalfa, for livestock feeding."
12695,27,nevada,12695,"The largest employers in the state in the first quarter of 2011 are the following, according to the Ministry of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation of Nevada:"
12696,27,nevada,12696,"Amtrak's California Zephyr train uses the original Union Pacific transcontinental railway line in daily service from Chicago to Emeryville, California, serving Elko, Winnemucca and Reno."
12697,27,nevada,12697, Las Vegas has not had a passenger train service since the cessation of Amtrak Desert Wind in 1997.
12698,27,nevada,12698,"Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provides a connecting service from Las Vegas to trains in Needles, California, Los Angeles and Bakersfield, California; and Stateline, Nevada, Sacramento, California."
12699,27,nevada,12699,A number of proposals have been made to reintroduce service in Los Angeles or Southern California.
12700,27,nevada,12700,The Union Pacific Railway has railways north and south of Nevada.
12701,27,nevada,12701,Greyhound Lines offers a bus service to the state.
12702,27,nevada,12702,"Interstate 15 (I-15) passes through the south end of the state, serving Las Vegas and other communities."
12703,27,nevada,12703,The I-215 and I-515 also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12704,27,nevada,12704,"I-80 crosses the northern portion of Nevada, following approximately the Humboldt River trail from Utah to the east and Truckee River to the west through Reno, California."
12705,27,nevada,12705," There's a spur track, I-580."
12706,27,nevada,12706,"The Nevada is also served by several American highways: the United States 6, the United States 50, the United States 93, the United States 95 and the United States 395."
12707,27,nevada,12707, There are also 189 roads of the state of Nevada.
12708,27,nevada,12708," Many counties of Nevada also have a network of county roads, although many are not signed or paved in rural areas."
12709,27,nevada,12709, Nevada is one of the few states in the United States that do not have a continuous interstate highway connecting its two major population centres – the road link between the Las Vegas and Reno regions is a combination of several interstate and American highways.
12710,27,nevada,12710,The route proposed by Interstate 11 could possibly remedy this situation.
12711,27,nevada,12711,"The state is one of the few in the country to allow semi-trailers with three trailers – a so-called ""road train"" in Australia."
12712,27,nevada,12712,"But the American versions are usually smaller, in part because they have to climb and descend rather steep collars."
12713,27,nevada,12713,RTC Transit is the transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12714,27,nevada,12714,"The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a bus network across the Las Vegas Valley, including the use of The Deuce, a two-storey bus, on the Las Vegas Strip and several peripheral roads."
12715,27,nevada,12715,RTC RIDE operates a local transport bus system throughout the metropolitan area of Reno-Sparks.
12716,27,nevada,12716, Other transit systems in the state include Carson City JAC.
12717,27,nevada,12717, Most other counties in the State do not have public transport at all.
12718,27,nevada,12718,"In addition, a 6.4-km monorail system provides public transportation in the Las Vegas area."
12719,27,nevada,12719," Las Vegas Monorail serves several casinos and Las Vegas Convention Centre, east of Las Vegas Band, near Paradise Road, with a possible future extension to McCarran International Airport."
12720,27,nevada,12720," Several hotels also have their own monorail lines between them, which are usually several blocks in length."
12721,27,nevada,12721,McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is the busiest airport in Nevada.
12722,27,nevada,12722,Reno-Tahoe International Airport (formerly Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the State.
12723,27,nevada,12723, Nevada has a flourishing solar energy sector.
12724,27,nevada,12724,An independent study conducted in 2013 concluded that solar energy users created a net benefit of $36 million.
12725,27,nevada,12725," However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission allowed the State's only electricity company, NV Energy, to charge higher rates and charges to solar panel users, resulting in an immediate collapse of the use of solar panels on the roof."
12726,27,nevada,12726,"In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository as the only site to be designated as a permanent repository for all highly radioactive wastes in the country."
12727,27,nevada,12727," Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Government of Nevada are divided into three separate departments: the Executive, composed of the Governor of Nevada and their Cabinet, as well as other elected members of the Constitution; the Legislative, composed of the Legislative Assembly of Nevada and the Senate; and the Judicial, composed of the Supreme Court of Nevada and lower courts."
12728,27,nevada,12728,"The Governor is the Chief Justice of Nevada, the Head of the Executive Department of the Government of the State, and the Commander-in-Chief of the State Military Forces."
12729,27,nevada,12729,"The present governor is Steve Sisolak, Democrat."
12730,27,nevada,12730,The Nevada Legislative Assembly is a bicameral body divided into a Assembly and a Senator.
12731,27,nevada,12731, Members of the Assembly sit for two years and members of the Senate for four years.
12732,27,nevada,12732,"The two Houses of the Nevada Legislative Assembly will be affected by the terms of office beginning in 2010, since senators and MPs/women will be limited to a maximum of 12 years in each chamber (by appointment or election that is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the Constitution that was recently confirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court in a unanimous decision."
12733,27,nevada,12733," Each session of the Parliament meets for a constitutional term of 120 days each odd year, or more if the Governor requests an extraordinary session."
12734,27,nevada,12734,"On 18 December 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a female majority in its legislature."
12735,27,nevada,12735,Women hold nine of the 21 seats in the Nevada Senate and 23 of the 42 seats in the Nevada Assembly.
12736,27,nevada,12736,The Nevada Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the State and the head of the judicial branch of Nevada.
12737,27,nevada,12737, Initial jurisdiction is shared between district courts (with general jurisdiction) and courts and municipal courts (both of limited jurisdiction).
12738,27,nevada,12738," Appeals from district courts are addressed directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which, in the context of a model of derogatory jurisdiction, has the discretion to refer cases to the Court of Appeal for final adjudication."
12739,27,nevada,12739,"The cities incorporated in Nevada, known as cities, have the power to legislate on anything not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to allow the local government to integrate the cities of Nevada to give them more flexibility and less restrictions from the Legislative Assembly.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"The municipal councils of unincorporated cities are limited local governments created either by the local county commission or by referendum, and play a purely consultative role and do not in any way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"In 1900 the population of Nevada was the smallest of all states and was shrinking, as the difficulties of living in a ""wild desert"" began to prevail over the lure of money for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743,The historian Lawrence Friedman explained what happened after:

13612,29,new_jersey,13612,"The Act offers many choices to communities that prefer strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and provides great flexibility to allow municipalities to choose the characteristics of their government: the number of seats on the council; the seats selected in general, by neighbourhoods or by a combination of the two; staggered or concurrent mandates; and a mayor chosen by the council or directly elected by voters."

13615,29,new_jersey,13615," Although municipalities retain their name derived from the types of government, they may have changed for one of the modern forms of government, or even more so in the past for one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities whose formal names are rather disconcerting for the general public."

13633,29,new_jersey,13633,"For many years, however, it was a Republican bastion, having given comfortable margin of victory to the Republican candidate in the tight elections of 1948, 1968 and 1976."

14114,31,new_york,14114,"The goal was to control more land for the trapping of animals, a career that most Aboriginal people had turned to in the hope of first trading with whites."
14115,31,new_york,14115," This completely changed the ethnography of the region, and most of the big game was hunted before the whites fully exploded the land."
14116,31,new_york,14116," After that, the Iroquois Confederation offered shelter to refugees from the Muscouten, Erie, Chononton, Tutelo, Saponi and Tuscarora nations."
14117,31,new_york,14117,"In the 1700s, they also merged with the Mohawks during the Franco-Indian war and took to the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after being decimated in the war."

14125,31,new_york,14125," When the United States drafted the Indian Removal Act, the Lenapes were moved to Missouri, while their cousins, the Mohicans, were sent to Wisconsin."
14126,31,new_york,14126,"In addition, in 1778, the United States moved Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario, although they did not stay long."

14152,31,new_york,14152,"At the same time, given the close commercial, personal and sentimental ties with Britain, many residents of New York were loyalists."
14153,31,new_york,14153,The capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the cannon and gunpowder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the siege of Boston in 1775.

14161,31,new_york,14161," After their victory, the British occupied the city of New York, making it their military and political base of operations in North America throughout the conflict, and hence the centre of interest of General George Washington's intelligence network."
14162,31,new_york,14162,"Of the famous British prison ships in Wallabout Bay, more American fighters have died of intentional negligence than of being killed in combat in every battle of the combined war."

15142,33,north_dakota,15142, Much of the growth was based on the development of Bakken's oil fields in the western part of the state.
15143,33,north_dakota,15143," Estimates of the remaining amount of oil in the region vary, some of which are estimated to be more than 100 years old."

15151,33,north_dakota,15151,"North Dakota is the fourth least populous state in the country; only Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming have fewer residents."
15152,33,north_dakota,15152," With less than 2,000 inhabitants in 1870, the population of North Dakota increased to nearly 680,000 in 1930."
15153,33,north_dakota,15153," Growth then slowed, and the population fluctuated slightly over the past seven decades, reaching 617,761 at the 1970 census, of which 642,200 at the 2000 census."

15159,33,north_dakota,15159,"North Dakota was a popular destination known to immigrant farmers and workers in general and their families, mainly from Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom."
15160,33,north_dakota,15160," Much of the colony was on the west side of the Red River Valley, as was seen in South Dakota and parallel in Minnesota."
15161,33,north_dakota,15161, This region is known for its fertile lands.
15162,33,north_dakota,15162,"At the beginning of the First World War, it was one of North America's richest agricultural regions."
15163,33,north_dakota,15163,"But a higher period of rain ended, and many migrants failed in arid conditions."

16232,36,oregon,16232,The first signs of Oregon have Spanish origins.
16233,36,oregon,16233,"The term ""orejón"" (which means ""great ear"") comes from the historical chronicle Relación de la Alta y Baja California (1598) written by the new Spaniard Rodrigo Montezuma and refers to the Columbia River when Spanish explorers entered the current North American territory which became part of the vice-royalty of New Spain."
16234,36,oregon,16234, This column is the first topographical and linguistic source for the Oregon place name.
16235,36,oregon,16235," There are also two other sources of Spanish origin, such as the word oregano, which refers to a plant that grows in the southern part of the region."
16236,36,oregon,16236,"It is possible that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, because there is a river in Spain called ""Arroyo del Oregón"" (which is located in the province of Ciudad Real); it is also possible that the ""j"" in the Spanish expression ""El Orejón"" was later corrupted into a ""g"", and in the context could refer to the ""aurore"" of the massive Columbia River at its mouth."
16237,36,oregon,16237," Another early use of the name, spelled Ouragon, was by Major Robert Rogers in a petition of 1765 to the Kingdom of Great Britain."

16240,36,oregon,16240,Rogers wrote:
16241,36,oregon,16241,"A theory is that the name comes from the French word Ouragan (""windstorm"" or ""hurricane""), which was applied to the West River on the basis of Indian tales of powerful Chinook winds on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from the first-hand French experience with the Chinook winds of the Great Plains."
16242,36,oregon,16242,"At that time, it was thought that the western river would rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the Great Plains."
16243,36,oregon,16243,Joaquin Miller explains in the magazine Sunset in 1904 how the name Oregon was derived:
16244,36,oregon,16244," Another narrative, approved as ""the most plausible explanation"" in the book Oregon Geographic Names, was advanced by George R. Stewart in an article from 1944 in American Speech."
16245,36,oregon,16245," According to Stewart, the name comes from the error of a engraver in a French map published in the early 18th century, on which the Ouisiconink River (Wisconsin) was spelled ""Ouaricon-sint"", broken on two lines with the -sint below, so there seems to be a river flowing westward called ""Ouaricon""."

16259,36,oregon,16259, Oregon is in two time zones.
16260,36,oregon,16260," Most of the county of Malheur is in the mountain time zone, while the rest of the state is in the Pacific time zone."
16261,36,oregon,16261,"The mountainous areas of western Oregon, home to three of the largest peaks in the United States, including Mount Hood, were formed by the volcanic activity of the Juan de Fuca Plate, a tectonic plaque that represents a continuing threat of volcanic activity and earthquakes in the region."

17781,40,south_dakota,17781,"The layers deposited during the Pleistocene era, from about two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota."
17782,40,south_dakota,17782," These are the youngest layers of rock and sediment in the state, the product of successive periods of glaciation that deposited a large amount of rock and soil, known as till, on the region."
17783,40,south_dakota,17783,The Great Plains cover most of the western part of two thirds of South Dakota.
17784,40,south_dakota,17784,"To the west of Missouri, the landscape becomes more arid and more rugged, composed of hilly hills, plains, ravines and steep flat-top hills called buttes."
17785,40,south_dakota,17785,"To the south, east of the Black Hills, we find the Badlands of South Dakota."
17786,40,south_dakota,17786,"The erosion of the Black Hills, marine skeletons that fell to the bottom of a vast shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this region."
17787,40,south_dakota,17787,The Black Hills are located in the southwest part of South Dakota and extend to Wyoming.
17788,40,south_dakota,17788," This range of low mountains covers 6,000 km2 (16 000 km2), with peaks increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 feet (600 to 1,200 m) above their bases."

17820,40,south_dakota,17820,It is a paleontological excavation of work and has one of the highest concentrations of mammoth remains in the world.
17821,40,south_dakota,17821,Humans have been living in what is today South Dakota for thousands of years.
17822,40,south_dakota,17822,The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC.
17823,40,south_dakota,17823," Between 500 and 800 AD, a semi-nomadic population known as the Mound Builders lived in central and eastern South Dakota."

17825,40,south_dakota,17825,"As early as 1500, the Arikara (or Ree) had settled in much of the Missouri Valley."
17826,40,south_dakota,17826,European contact with the region began in 1743 when the LaVérendrye brothers explored the region.
17827,40,south_dakota,17827,"The LaVérendrye group buried a plaque near the site of modern Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of the Great Louisiana."
17828,40,south_dakota,17828,"In 1762, the entire region became part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802."
17829,40,south_dakota,17829,"By the early 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced Arikara as the dominant group in the region."
17830,40,south_dakota,17830,"In 1803 the United States purchased the territory of Louisiana, a region that included most of South Dakota from Napoleon Bonaparte, and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly known as the ""Lewis and Clark Expedition"" to explore the region."
17831,40,south_dakota,17831,"In 1817, an American fur trade post was established at the present Fort Pierre, which began to settle continuously in the United States in the region."
17832,40,south_dakota,17832,"In 1855, the American army purchased Fort Pierre, but abandoned it in 1857 in favour of Fort Randall in the south."
17833,40,south_dakota,17833,"At that time, the establishment by the Americans and Europeans increased rapidly, and in 1858 the Yankton Sioux signed the Treaty of 1858, giving to the United States most of the present South Dakota."
17834,40,south_dakota,17834,The land speculators founded two of the largest cities in South Dakota today: Sioux Falls in 1856 and Yankton in 1859.
17835,40,south_dakota,17835,"In 1861, the territory of Dakota was created by the United States government (it originally included North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Montana and Wyoming)."

17837,40,south_dakota,17837,In 1874 gold was discovered in the Black Hills during a military expedition led by George A. Custer and miners and explorers began illegally entering the land promised to the Lakota.
17838,40,south_dakota,17838,The Custer expedition took place despite the fact that the Sioux had received the entire western half of the present South Dakota (West River) in 1868 by the Treaty of Laramie under the Great Sioux Reserve.
17839,40,south_dakota,17839,"The Sioux refused to grant mining rights or lands in the Black Hills, and the war broke out after the United States did not prevent white miners and settlers from entering the area."
17840,40,south_dakota,17840," Finally, the United States won and separated the Great Sioux Reserve into five reserves, settling the Lakota there."
17841,40,south_dakota,17841,"In 1980, the Supreme Court and Congress ordered compensation, but the Lakota still refused to accept it, insisting on the restitution of their lands."
17842,40,south_dakota,17842,"A growing population and political concerns (the accession of two states meant the arrival of four new senators for the Republican Party) caused the division of Dakota territory and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations in which he officially admitted South Dakota and North Dakota to union on November 2, 1889."
17843,40,south_dakota,17843, Harrison had the papers tight to mask which was signed first and the order was not recorded.
17844,40,south_dakota,17844,"On 29 December 1890, the massacre of the injured knee occurred in the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve."

17847,40,south_dakota,17847," During the 1930s, several economic and climate conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota."
17848,40,south_dakota,17848," Lack of precipitation, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plain states."
17849,40,south_dakota,17849,"Fertile soil was blown into massive dust storms, and several crops were completely destroyed."
17850,40,south_dakota,17850,"The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with the seizure of local banks and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, led to the release of many Dakotas from the south of the state."
17851,40,south_dakota,17851,The South Dakota population declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.
17852,40,south_dakota,17852,"Economic stability returned with the entry of the United States into the Second World War in 1941, when demand for state agricultural and industrial products increased as the nation mobilized for war."
17853,40,south_dakota,17853,"In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was adopted by the U.S. Congress as part of the 1944 Flood Control Act, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially located in South Dakota."

17860,40,south_dakota,17860," Despite the growth of the State's population and recent economic development, many rural areas have struggled over the past 50 years with the decline of local populations and the emigration of educated young adults to major cities in South Dakota, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states."
17861,40,south_dakota,17861,Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture have greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of small family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges for rural cities.
17862,40,south_dakota,17862," However, the state often ranks first for its way of life, and Gallup's Well-Being Index in 2018 has named South Dakota the happiest and healthier state in the United States."
17863,40,south_dakota,17863,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of South Dakota was 884,659 on July 1, 2019, an 8.66 per cent increase over the 2010 U.S. census, while only North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming have fewer residents."

17871,40,south_dakota,17871," Ethnically, 2.7 per cent of the population of South Dakota was of Hispanic, Latin or Spanish origin (they may be of any race)."
17872,40,south_dakota,17872,"In 2011, 25.4% of the population of South Dakota under 1 years of age were minorities, which means that there was at least one non-Hispanic white parent."

17879,40,south_dakota,17879, Five of the state's counties are entirely within the limits of sovereign Indian reserves.
17880,40,south_dakota,17880," Because of the limitations of climate and land, and the isolation of urban areas with more employment opportunities, the standard of living on many South Dakota reserves is often well below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009."
17881,40,south_dakota,17881,"The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, Crow Creek Reserve, is 70% and 21% of households do not have basic plumbing or kitchen equipment."
17882,40,south_dakota,17882,A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found that 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve did not have telephones.
17883,40,south_dakota,17883,"The isolation of reserves also impedes their ability to generate income from gambling casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centres."
17884,40,south_dakota,17884,"In 1995, the legislature passed a law making English the ""common language"" of the State."
17885,40,south_dakota,17885," Since 2019, ""the language of the Great Sioux Nation, composed of three dialects, Dakota, Lakota and Nakota"", is an official language."

17892,40,south_dakota,17892,"The change was described as a ""rural leak"" as family farming declined."
17893,40,south_dakota,17893,Young people moved to cities to find more jobs.
17894,40,south_dakota,17894," This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 counties in South Dakota losing their population between the 1990 census and the 2000 census."
17895,40,south_dakota,17895," During this period, nine counties suffered a population loss of more than 10 per cent, with Harding County in the northwest corner of the state losing nearly 19 per cent of its population."
17896,40,south_dakota,17896, Low birth rates and the lack of young immigrants have led to an increase in the median age of many of these counties.
17897,40,south_dakota,17897,"In 24 counties, at least 20% of the population is over the age of 65, compared with a national rate of 12.8 per cent."

18078,41,tennessee,18078," What is now Tennessee was originally part of North Carolina, then the Southwest Territory."
18079,41,tennessee,18079,Tennessee was admitted into the Union as 16th State on 1 June 1796.
18080,41,tennessee,18080,Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join Confederation at the beginning of the American civil war in 1861.
18081,41,tennessee,18081," Occupied by the Union forces from 1862 onwards, he was the first state to be resettled in the Union at the end of the war."
18082,41,tennessee,18082,"Tennessee has provided more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state outside Virginia, and more soldiers for the Union Army than the rest of the combined Confederation."
18083,41,tennessee,18083," From the reconstruction he had a competitive party policy, but a democratic takeover in the late 1880s had led to the adoption of laws on the abandonment of the right to vote that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting."
18084,41,tennessee,18084," This reduced political competition in the state until after the adoption of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century, although unlike in the deep South, the Republicans of Tennessee still expected at least a third of the vote in state-wide elections via the East Tennessee and the Highland Rim Unionists."
18085,41,tennessee,18085,"In the 20th century, Tennessee moved from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, assisted by massive federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Authority and, in the early 1940s, in the city of Oak Ridge."
18086,41,tennessee,18086," This city was founded just outside Knoxville to house the Manhattan project's uranium enrichment facilities, helping to build the world's first atomic bombs, two of which were dropped on Imperial Japan towards the end of World War II."
18087,41,tennessee,18087," After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became and remains a key centre of scientific research."
18088,41,tennessee,18088,"In 2016, the tennessine element was named for the state, largely in recognition of the roles played by Oak Ridge, Vanderbilt University and the University of Tennessee in discovering the element."
18089,41,tennessee,18089,"Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing and tourism."
18090,41,tennessee,18090,"Poultry, soybeans and livestock are the government's main agricultural products and the major manufacturing exports include chemicals, transportation equipment and electrical equipment."
18091,41,tennessee,18091,"Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited national park in the country, is located in the eastern part of the state, and part of the Appalachian Trail follows roughly the border between Tennessee and North Carolina."
18092,41,tennessee,18092," Other major tourist attractions include the Aquarium du Tennessee and the Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel in Chattanooga; Dollywood in Pigeon Forge; the Aquarium de Ripley des Smokies and Ober Gatlinburg in Gatlinburg; the Parthenon, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville; the Jack Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg; the residence and tomb of Elvis Presley in Graceland; the Memphis Zoo; the National Museum of Civil Rights in Memphis; and the Bristol Highway in Bristol."
18093,41,tennessee,18093,"The first variant of the name that became Tennessee was recorded by Captain Juan Pardo, the Spanish explorer, when he and his men passed through an American Indian village called ""Tanasqui"" in 1567 while traveling inland to South Carolina."
18094,41,tennessee,18094,"At the beginning of the 18th century, British traders met a city of Cherokee called Tanasi (or ""Tanase"", in the syllable : """") in the present Monroe County, Tennessee."
18095,41,tennessee,18095,The city was located on a river of the same name (now called the Little Tennessee River) and appears on the maps as early as 1725.
18096,41,tennessee,18096,"It is not known if it was the same city as Juan Pardo's, although recent research suggests that Pardo's ""Tanasqui"" was located at the confluence of the Pigeon River and the French Broad River near modern Newport."
18097,41,tennessee,18097,The meaning and origin of this word is uncertain.
18098,41,tennessee,18098, Some accounts suggest that this is a Cherokee modification of an earlier Yuchi word.
18099,41,tennessee,18099,"It is said to be a ""meeting place,"" a ""wind river,"" or a ""big bend river."""
18100,41,tennessee,18100," According to ethnographer James Mooney, the name ""can't be analysed"" and its meaning is lost."
18101,41,tennessee,18101,"The modern spelling, Tennessee, is attributed to James Glen, the governor of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence in the 1750s."
18102,41,tennessee,18102,"The spelling was popularized by Henry Timberlake's ""Drawing of the Cherokee Country"" publication in 1765."
18103,41,tennessee,18103,"In 1788 North Carolina created Tennessee County, the third county to be established in what is now the Middle Tennessee."
18104,41,tennessee,18104,(Tennessee County was the predecessor of the present counties of Montgomery and Robertson.)
18105,41,tennessee,18105," When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state outside the South-West territory, it adopted the name of the ""Tennessee"" state."
18106,41,tennessee,18106,"Tennessee is known as The Volunteer State, a nickname that some claimed to have won during the War of 1812 because of the important role played by Tennessee volunteer soldiers, especially during the Battle of New Orleans."
18107,41,tennessee,18107," Other sources differ as to the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to volunteers for the war between Mexico and America from 1846 to 1848."
18108,41,tennessee,18108," This explanation is more likely, as President Polk's call for 2,600 national volunteers at the beginning of the war between Mexico and America resulted in only 30,000 Tennessee volunteers, largely in response to Davy Crockett's death and the appeals of the former Tennessee governor and then Texas politician Sam Houston."
18109,41,tennessee,18109,"Tennessee borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north; North Carolina to the east; Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi to the south; Arkansas and Missouri on the Mississippi River to the west."
18110,41,tennessee,18110,Tennessee is linked to Missouri as a state bordering other states.
18111,41,tennessee,18111,The State is tried by the Tennessee River.
18112,41,tennessee,18112,"The highest point in the condition is Clingmans Dome at 2643 feet (2,025 m)."
18113,41,tennessee,18113,"Clingmans Dome, located on the eastern border of Tennessee, is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail and is the third highest summit in the United States east of Mississippi."
18114,41,tennessee,18114,The state line between Tennessee and North Carolina crosses the summit.
18115,41,tennessee,18115,"The lowest point in the state is the Mississippi River, at the Mississippi State Line: 54 meters."
18116,41,tennessee,18116,The geographical center of the state is located in Murfreesboro.
18117,41,tennessee,18117,"The state of Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically and legally divided into three major divisions: the Eastern Tennessee, the Middle Tennessee and the Western Tennessee."
18118,41,tennessee,18118,The Constitution of the State does not allow more than two judges of the five-member Supreme Court of Tennessee to be drawn from a single major division and a similar rule applies to certain commissions and commissions.
18119,41,tennessee,18119,"Tennessee has six main physiographic regions: the Blue Ridge, the Appalachian Ridge and the valley region, the Cumberland Plateau, the Highlands Coast, the Nashville Basin and the Gulf Coast Plain."
18120,41,tennessee,18120,"Tennessee houses the most caves in the United States, with more than ten thousand documents."
18121,41,tennessee,18121, About half of the state is located in the Tennessee Valley watershed in the Tennessee River.
18122,41,tennessee,18122," Approximately the northern half of the Middle Tennessee, including Nashville and Clarksville, and a small portion of the Eastern Tennessee are in the Cumberland River basin."
18123,41,tennessee,18123,"A small portion of north central Tennessee, in the counties of Sumner, Macon and Clay, is located in the Green River watershed."
18124,41,tennessee,18124, These three basins are tributaries of the Ohio River watershed.
18125,41,tennessee,18125, Most of the West Tennessee lies in the lower Mississippi River watershed.
18126,41,tennessee,18126,"The entire state is located in the Mississippi watershed, with the exception of a small area of Bradley and Polk counties across the Conasauga River, which is part of the Mobile Bay watershed."
18127,41,tennessee,18127,"The Blue Ridge area is located on the eastern edge of Tennessee, which borders North Carolina."
18128,41,tennessee,18128," This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the Western Blue Ridge Mountains, which are subdivided into several sub-ranges, namely the Smoky Mountains, the Bald Mountains, the Unicoi Mountains, the Unaka and Roan Highlands Mountains, and the Iron Mountains."
18129,41,tennessee,18129,"The average altitude in the Blue Ridge area is 1,500 metres above sea level."
18130,41,tennessee,18130,"Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the state, is located in this area."
18131,41,tennessee,18131,"The Blue Ridge area has never been so sparsely populated, and today much of it is protected by the Cherokee National Forest, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness and state parks."
18132,41,tennessee,18132,"The Ridge and Valley area, where many tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Tennessee Valley, is about 89 km west of the Blue Ridge."
18133,41,tennessee,18133," This area of Tennessee is covered with fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges, such as Mount Bays and Mount Clinch."
18134,41,tennessee,18134,"The western part of the Tennessee Valley, where depressions become wider and ridges lower, is called the great valley."
18135,41,tennessee,18135,"In this valley there are many cities and two of the three urban areas of the region, Knoxville, the third largest city in the state, and Chattanooga, the fourth largest city in the state."
18136,41,tennessee,18136,"The third urban area, the three cities, including Bristol, Johnson City and Kingsport and their environs, is northeast of Knoxville."
18137,41,tennessee,18137,The Cumberland plateau rises west of the Tennessee Valley
18138,41,tennessee,18138,"The altitude of the Cumberland Plateau ranges from 1,500 to approximately 2,000 feet (460 to approximately 610 m) above sea level."
18139,41,tennessee,18139,"The East Tennessee has several important transport links with the Middle and Western Tennessee, as well as the rest of the nation and the world, including several major airports and interstates."
18140,41,tennessee,18140,"The McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) in Knoxville and Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA) in Chattanooga, as well as the Tri-Cities Regional Airport (TRI), provide air service to many destinations."
18141,41,tennessee,18141,"I-24, I-81, I-40, I-75 and I-26, as well as many state highways and other important roads, cross the Grande Division and connect Chattanooga, Knoxville and the three cities, as well as other cities such as Cleveland, Athens and Sevierville."
18142,41,tennessee,18142,"To the west of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim, a raised plain that surrounds the Nashville Basin."
18143,41,tennessee,18143,"The northern area of the Highland Rim, known for its high tobacco production, is sometimes called the Pennyroyal Plateau, located mainly in southwestern Kentucky."
18144,41,tennessee,18144,The Nashville Basin is characterized by a rich and fertile agricultural country and a wide variety of natural fauna.
18145,41,tennessee,18145,The Middle Tennessee was a common destination for settlers who crossed the Appalachians since Virginia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
18146,41,tennessee,18146,"An important trade route called the Natchez Trace, created and used for many generations by American Indians, connects the middle Tennessee to the city of the lower Mississippi of Natchez."
18147,41,tennessee,18147,The Natchez Trace route was used as the base of a panoramic highway called Natchez Trace Parkway.
18148,41,tennessee,18148, Some of the last large American chestnut trees are growing in this region.
18149,41,tennessee,18149, They are used to aid in the reproduction of burn-resistant trees.
18150,41,tennessee,18150,The average Tennessee is one of the main population and transport centres of the state and the heart of the state government.

18154,41,tennessee,18154,"The Gulf coastal plain is, in terms of area, the main land region of Tennessee."
18155,41,tennessee,18155,It is part of the great geographic region that begins in the Gulf of Mexico and extends north to southern Illinois.
18156,41,tennessee,18156,"In Tennessee, the Gulf Coast Plain is divided into three sections from the Tennessee River to the east to the Mississippi River to the west."
18157,41,tennessee,18157,"The easternmost stretch, about 16 km wide, consists of hilly lands along the west bank of Tennessee."
18158,41,tennessee,18158,To the west of this narrow strip of land is a vast area of hills and streams that extends to the Mississippi River.
18159,41,tennessee,18159,"In Memphis, the Tennessee Bottoms ends with steep bluffs overlooking the river."
18160,41,tennessee,18160,"To the west of Tennessee Bottoms lies the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, less than 90 metres above sea level."
18161,41,tennessee,18161," This area of lowlands, flood plains and marshlands is sometimes called the Delta region."
18162,41,tennessee,18162,Memphis is the economic centre of West Tennessee.
18163,41,tennessee,18163," Most of West Tennessee remained Indian land until the Cessation of Chickasaw in 1818, when Chickasaw ceded its lands between Tennessee and Mississippi."
18164,41,tennessee,18164,The portion of Chickasaw's divestment in Kentucky is now known as the Jackson Purchase.
18165,41,tennessee,18165, Areas under the control and management of the National Parks Service include the following:
18166,41,tennessee,18166," Fifty-four state parks with an area of approximately 132,000 acres (530 km2), as well as parts of Grands Monts Smoky National Park and Cherokee National Forest, and Cumberland Gap National Historic Park are located in Tennessee."
18167,41,tennessee,18167,"Sportsmen and visitors are attracted to Reelfoot Lake, originally formed by the earthquakes of 1811–12 New Madrid; the stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, as well as the lotus bed covering the shallow waters, give the lake a strange beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168," Most of the condition has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a temperate climate of mountain or continental humid due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee's climate, with southern winds accounting for most of the annual precipitation of the state."
18170,41,tennessee,18170,"In general, the condition has warm summers and mild to cold winters with generous precipitation throughout the year, with the highest average monthly precipitation generally in winter and spring between December and April."
18171,41,tennessee,18171,The driest months are on average between August and October.
18172,41,tennessee,18172,"On average, the state receives 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation per year."

18174,41,tennessee,18174,"Summers in the state are generally warm and humid, with most of the average state of about 90°F (32°C) during the summer months."
18175,41,tennessee,18175,"Winters tend to be mild to fresh, increasing in freshness at higher altitudes."
18176,41,tennessee,18176,"In general, for areas outside the highest mountains, the average night hollows are close to freezing for most states."
18177,41,tennessee,18177,"The highest recorded temperature was 113°F (45°C) at Perryville on 9 August 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature was -32°F (−36°C) at Mountain City on 30 December 1917."
18178,41,tennessee,18178," Although the state is far enough away from the coast to avoid any direct impact of a hurricane, the state location makes it likely to be affected by the remnants of tropical cyclones that weaken on the earth and can cause significant rainfall, such as tropical storm Chris in 1982 and hurricane Opal in 1995."
18179,41,tennessee,18179,"The average state is about fifty days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large hail and devastating winds."
18180,41,tennessee,18180,"The tornadoes are possible throughout the state, with the West and the Middle Tennessee the most vulnerable."
18181,41,tennessee,18181," Sometimes, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating tornadoes of April 2011 that killed twenty people in North Georgia and Southeast Tennessee."
18182,41,tennessee,18182,"On average, the state has 15 tornadoes a year."
18183,41,tennessee,18183,"Tennessee tornadoes can be severe, and Tennessee leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes that have died."
18184,41,tennessee,18184,"Winter storms are an occasional problem, like the infamous 1993 Blizzard, although ice storms are more likely."
18185,41,tennessee,18185,"Fog is a persistent problem in some parts of the state, particularly in Eastern Tennessee."
18186,41,tennessee,18186,"The capital and largest city is Nashville, although Knoxville, Kingston, and Murfreesboro have all served as state capitals in the past."
18187,41,tennessee,18187,The metropolitan area of 13 counties of Nashville has been the largest in the state since late 1990.
18188,41,tennessee,18188,Memphis was the biggest city in the state until 2018 when it was overtaken by Nashville.
18189,41,tennessee,18189,"Chattanooga and Knoxville, both to the east near the Smoky Mountains, are about a third of this size."
18190,41,tennessee,18190,"The city of Clarksville is a fifth significant population centre, 72 km northwest of Nashville."
18191,41,tennessee,18191,"Murfreesboro is the sixth largest city in Tennessee, with a population of 146,900."
18192,41,tennessee,18192,"The area now known as Tennessee was first inhabited by Paleo-Indians nearly 12,000 years ago."
18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between the first colony and the time of European contact were unknown, but several distinct cultural phases were named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 B.C.), Woodland (1000 B.C. – 1000 B.C.) and Mississippi (1000–1600 B.C.), whose chiefs of staff were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee who lived in the Tennessee River valley before the migration of Cherokee into river waters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first European excursions recorded in what is now known as Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559 and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo registered the name ""Tanasqui"" of a local Indian village, which evolved to the current name of the state."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,At the time Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi.
18197,41,tennessee,18197," Perhaps because of devastating European diseases the Indian tribes, which would have left a vacuum of population, and also because of the expansion of the European colony in the north, the Cherokee moved south of the area now known as Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European settlers spread throughout the region, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all the Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw peoples, and finally the Cherokee peoples in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British colony in today's Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers of the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near Vonore today."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,Fort Loudoun became the westmost British outpost on that date.
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard of Brahm and built by forces under the direction of British Captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202," After his completion, Captain Raymond Demeré abandoned command on 14 Aug. 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203," Hostilities broke out between the British and the neighbour Overhill Cherokees, and the siege of Fort Loudoun ended with its surrender on 7 Aug. 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The following morning, Captain Paul Demeré and a number of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of the East and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began to arrive at the end of the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,"The majority of 18th-century settlers were English or mainly English, but almost 20% were also Scottish-Irish."
18207,41,tennessee,18207," These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on land leased to the Cherokee people."
18208,41,tennessee,18208," During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycomore Shoals (now Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his belligerent faction of Cherokee, who were aligned with British loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209, These Cherokee renegades were designated by settlers as Chickamauga.
18210,41,tennessee,18210, They opposed the annexation by North Carolina of the Washington District and the concomitant settlement of the Transylvanian colony further north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The lives of many settlers were spared from the first warrior attacks by the warnings of Nancy Ward, cousin of Dragging Canoe."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The boundary fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a gathering place in 1780 for the men of Overmountain to make a voyage over the Appalachian Mountains, to engage and defeat the British army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213, Three counties in the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) left North Carolina in 1784 and formed the state of Franklin.
18214,41,tennessee,18214," Efforts to gain admission to the Union have failed, and the counties (currently eight) joined North Carolina in 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized in the Southwest Territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In an effort to encourage settlers to move westward into the new territory, in 1787, the mother state of North Carolina ordered to cut off a road to take settlers to the Cumberland colonies – from the south end of Mount Clinch (in Eastern Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Avery Trace"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Wilderness Road"" by the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,Tennessee was admitted to the Union on 1 June 1796 as the 16th State.
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It was the first state created from territories under the jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States.
18220,41,tennessee,18220," Apart from the 13 former colonies, only Vermont and Kentucky preceded the creation of Tennessee, and neither was ever a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, article I, section 31, stipulates that the starting point for the identification of the boundary is the extreme height of the stone mountain, at the point where the Virginia line intersects it, and leads essentially the extreme heights of the mountain ranges through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee after the Amerindian cities of Cowee and Old Chota, from thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (mount Unicoi) to the southern boundary of the State; all the territory, lands and waters to the west of the said line are included within the limits and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also specified that the boundaries and jurisdiction of the State would include the future acquisition of land, reference to possible land exchanges with other States, or the acquisition of territories west of Mississippi."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As other white settlers settled in Tennessee, they conflicted with the Amerindian tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224," During the administration of US President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."

18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi, ""the path where we screamed""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Amerindians forced to emigrate as a result of U.S. Indian abduction efforts, so the expression ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indians, particularly among the ""Five Civilized Tribes."""

18230,41,tennessee,18230,"In February 1861 the secessionists of the Tennessee government, led by Governor Isham Harris, sought approval of an agreement to break ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a margin of 54-46%."
18231,41,tennessee,18231,"The strongest opposition to secession comes from the Eastern Tennessee, which later tries to form a separate state aligned with the Union."
18232,41,tennessee,18232," Following the confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's appeal to the Tennessee and other states, Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization, submitted a secession order to the General Assembly and made direct openings to the confederate government."

18245,41,tennessee,18245,"The Confederates besieged Chattanooga during the Chattanooga campaign in early autumn 1863, but were hunted by Grant in November."
18246,41,tennessee,18246," Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General Braxton Bragg, who led the Army of the Tennessee of Perryville, Kentucky, to another Confederate defeat at Chattanooga."

18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution prohibits martial law within its jurisdiction.
18472,41,tennessee,18472, This may be the result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by the U.S. government's (North) Union forces after the American civil war.
18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee politics, like that of most American states, is dominated by republican and democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474," Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state until the period of the American civil war; for decades, a third east of the state was strongly republican and the two-thirds west voted mostly democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475," This division was linked to the state model of agriculture, plantations and servitude."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern part was made up of Yeoman farmers, but the middle and western Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton, which depended on slave labour."

18480,41,tennessee,18480," After the reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have a competitive party policy, but in the 1880s the White-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a voting fee for voter registration."

18482,41,tennessee,18482,"In 1900, African Americans accounted for 23.8% of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and Western Tennessee."
18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the State Legislative Assembly approved a form of city committee government on the basis of a broad vote for a few positions in a committee council; several cities adopted this as another means of limiting African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,"In 1913, the state legislator passed a bill allowing cities to adopt this structure without legislative approval."
18485,41,tennessee,18485," After the abandonment of the right to vote of the blacks, the Republican Party of Tennessee became a predominantly white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, with the exception of two republican landslides at the national level of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee strongly supported Warren G. Harding over the governor of Ohio James Cox, and in 1928, when he voted more resolutely for Herbert Hoover over the governor of New York Al Smith), the state was part of the democratic South Solid until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In this post-war decade, he voted twice for the Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former commander of the Allied armed forces during the Second World War."
18488,41,tennessee,18488," Since then, more state voters have turned to Republican support, and candidates for the democratic presidency have only worn Tennessee four times."
18489,41,tennessee,18489,"In 1960, African Americans made up 16.45 per cent of the population of the state."
18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was only after the mid-1960s and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new arrangements, such as the governments of the major municipal commissions, were adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491,Ex-Gov
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former U.S. Senator Bill Brock won in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among the Whites for state-wide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493,Tennessee has selected governors from various parties since 1970.
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"At the beginning of the 21st century, Republican voters controlled most of the state, especially in rural and suburban areas outside the cities; democratic power was mainly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and was particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter area comprises a large African-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496," Historically, the Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"The 1st and 2nd districts of Tennessee, located respectively in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, are among the few historical republican districts in the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498,The inhabitants of these districts supported the Union about Confederation during the civil war.
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first one has been in Republican hands ever since 1881, and the Republicans (or their predecessors) have held him for all but four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The second was permanently held by Republicans or their predecessors since 1859.
18501,41,tennessee,18501,"In the 2000 presidential election, Vice President Al Gore, a democratic American"
18502,41,tennessee,18502," Senator of Tennessee, did not bear his original state, an unusual event but revealing to strengthen Republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503," Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, with his margin of victory in the state rising from 4% in 2000 to 14% in 2004."
18504,41,tennessee,18504," Candidates for the democratic presidency of the southern states, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, are generally better off than their northern counterparts in Tennessee, especially among voters split outside metropolitan areas."

18507,41,tennessee,18507,"In the 2008 elections, the Republican party took control of the two chambers of the Tennessee state legislature for the first time since the reconstruction."
18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, some 30 per cent of the state's electorate identified itself as independent."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"Baker v. Carr (1962) of the United States Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one vote"", requiring the state legislatures to redistribute the division of Congress according to the decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,He also demanded that the two chambers of state legislatures be population-based for representation rather than geographical districts such as counties.
18511,41,tennessee,18511, This case was the result of a trial that challenged the long-standing rural bias in the allocation of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512," After decades when urban populations had been underrepresented in many state legislatures, this important decision has led to increased (and proportional) importance in the policy of the State by cities and, ultimately, the suburbs, legislators and civil servants of the whole State in relation to their population within the State."
18513,41,tennessee,18513,"The judgement also applied to many other states that had long been under the control of rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont and Montana."
18514,41,tennessee,18514,"Tennessee maintains four law enforcement agencies: Tennessee Road Patrol, Tennessee Wildlife Agency, Tennessee Investigation Bureau and Tennessee Environment and Conservation Department."

18520,41,tennessee,18520,The Tennessee constitution requires each county to have an elected sheriff.
18521,41,tennessee,18521,"In 94 of the 95 counties, the sheriff is the county chief of law enforcement and has jurisdiction over the county as a whole."
18522,41,tennessee,18522," Each Sheriff's Office is responsible for the service of warrants, court security, prison operations and law enforcement in unincorporated areas of a county, as well as support to municipal police services."
18523,41,tennessee,18523,Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police service to provide police services within the limits of their business.

18528,41,tennessee,18528,The death penalty has existed since Tennessee.
18529,41,tennessee,18529," Before 1913, the method of execution was hanging."
18530,41,tennessee,18530," From 1913 to 1915, there was an interruption of executions, but they were restored in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531," From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (Furman v. Georgia) that capital punishment was unconstitutional, there were no other executions."
18532,41,tennessee,18532,"The death penalty was resumed in 1978, although prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 were mostly sentenced to life imprisonment."
18533,41,tennessee,18533," From 1916 to 1960, the state executed 125 inmates."

18571,42,texas,18571,"A slave state before the American Civil War, Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861, and officially joined the Confederate States of America on March 2nd of that year."

18574,42,texas,18574," Before and after the American civil war, the bovine industry, which Texas dominated, was a major economic engine for the state, creating the traditional image of Texas's cowboy."
18575,42,texas,18575,"In the 19th century, cotton and softwood lumber became important industries as the livestock industry became less lucrative."
18576,42,texas,18576,"In the end, it was the discovery of large oil deposits (Spindletop in particular) that triggered an economic boom that became the driving force of the economy for much of the 20th century."

18588,42,texas,18588,Texas is situated between two major cultural spheres of pre-Columbian North America: the southwest and the plains.
18589,42,texas,18589,Archaeologists found that three large indigenous cultures lived in this territory and reached their peak of development before the first European contact.
18590,42,texas,18590, These included:
18591,42,texas,18591," When the Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Aboriginal people divided into many smaller tribes."
18592,42,texas,18592," These were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan and Uto-Aztecan."
18593,42,texas,18593,"The peoples of Uto-Aztecan Puebloan lived near Rio Grande in the western part of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived inside, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mainly centered along the Gulf coast."
18594,42,texas,18594,"At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the Aranama, lived in southern Texas."
18595,42,texas,18595," This entire cultural group, mainly centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct."
18596,42,texas,18596,It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern part of the original state.
18597,42,texas,18597,"At the time when the region came to be explored, it belonged to the well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztécan people that had turned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century."
18598,42,texas,18598,"It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztécans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans."
18599,42,texas,18599," There was no dominant culture in the present Texas region, and many peoples lived there."
18600,42,texas,18600," Native American tribes living within the current boundaries of Texas include Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa and Wichita."
18601,42,texas,18601,"The name Texas derives from táysha, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, meaning ""friends"" or ""allies""."
18602,42,texas,18602,"The area was mainly controlled by the Spaniards during the first two centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution."
18603,42,texas,18603," They were not particularly kind to their indigenous populations, let alone to the Caddoans, who had no confidence because their culture was shared between the Spanish and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604," When the Spaniards briefly succeeded in conquering the colony of Louisiana, they decided to change tactics and try to be extremely friends with the Indians, which they continued even after the French had taken over the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605, After the purchase of Louisiana in 1803 the United States inherited this strange circumstance.
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred American company and almost all their population migrated to the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spaniards felt swindled after spending so much time and effort and began to try to attract the Caddo in return, promising them even more land."
18608,42,texas,18608," Apparently, without knowing how they arrived, the United States (which had begun to convince the tribes to separate from the Whites by selling everything and moving west since they purchased Louisiana) faced an overflow of indigenous peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and had been able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced people to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609," They included Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, among others, who had all come to consider the Caddoans as saviors, making these peoples very influential."
18610,42,texas,18610,The question of whether an Amerindian tribe was friendly or warrior was critical of the fate of European explorers and settlers on that land.
18611,42,texas,18611," Friendly tribes have taught newcomers to grow native crops, prepare food, and hunt wild game."
18612,42,texas,18612,The warring tribes have made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans by their attacks and resistance to new arrivals.
18613,42,texas,18613," During the Texas Revolution, the United States was strongly involved."
18614,42,texas,18614,Previous treaties with Spain prohibit both parties from militarizing its indigenous population in any potential conflict between the two nations.
18615,42,texas,18615,"At this time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans began to spread."
18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans always had no clue when questioned, the Texan and American authorities in the region had never been able to find any solid evidence linking them to it, and often it was so far from Caddoan lands, it made little sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,"It seems very likely that these are false flag attacks aimed at triggering a cascade effect in order to force the indigenous people under Caddoan's influence to enter into armed conflict without violating any treaty, preferably on the Spanish side."
18618,42,texas,18618," Although no evidence was found as to who the culprit was, Texas officials at the time repeatedly tried to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check."
18619,42,texas,18619," Moreover, the Caddoans have never turned to violence because of this, with the exception of self-defence cases."
18620,42,texas,18620,"In the 1830s, the United States had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the tears trail."
18621,42,texas,18621," Fearing the reward of other indigenous peoples, Indian agents throughout the eastern United States began desperately trying to convince all their indigenous peoples to uproot and move westward."
18622,42,texas,18622, They included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18623,42,texas,18623," After the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their native peoples, but did not honour old land claims or agreements."
18624,42,texas,18624, This began the movement of indigenous people northward into what would become Indian territory – the modern Oklahoma.
18625,42,texas,18625,"The first historical document concerning Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda."
18626,42,texas,18626," Nine years later, the shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas."
18627,42,texas,18627,"Cabeza de Vaca reports that in 1528, when the Spaniards landed in the area, ""half of the natives died of bowel disease and blamed us""."

18631,42,texas,18631,René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle's calculation errors enabled him to establish the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River.
18632,42,texas,18632,The colony lasted for only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.
18633,42,texas,18633,"In 1690 the Spanish authorities, concerned that France was a competitive threat, built several missions in eastern Texas."

18635,42,texas,18635," When France began to install Louisiana, mainly in the southern part of the state, in 1716 the Spanish authorities reacted by creating a new series of missions to eastern Texas."
18636,42,texas,18636," Two years later, they established San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the region."
18637,42,texas,18637,The hostile indigenous tribes and the distance of the neighbouring Spanish colonies discouraged the settlers from going to the area.
18638,42,texas,18638,It was one of the least populated provinces in New Spain.
18639,42,texas,18639,"In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apaches irritated many tribes, including the Comanches, Tonkawa and Hasinai."
18640,42,texas,18640,The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and then helped defeat the Apache and Karankawa tribes of Lipan.
18641,42,texas,18641," With the establishment of more missions, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes."

18643,42,texas,18643," When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, the American authorities insisted on the agreement also including Texas."
18644,42,texas,18644,"The border between New Spain and the United States was finally established at the Sabine River in 1819, which is now the border between Texas and Louisiana."
18645,42,texas,18645," Favourable for new land, many American settlers refused to recognize the agreement."
18646,42,texas,18646, Several filibusters raised armies to invade the region west of the Sabine River.
18647,42,texas,18647,"In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence included the territory of Texas, which became an integral part of Mexico."
18648,42,texas,18648," Due to its low population, Mexico was part of the State of Coahuila y Tejas."
18649,42,texas,18649,"In the hope that more settlers will reduce Comanche raids, Mexican Texas has liberalized its immigration policies to allow immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain."
18650,42,texas,18650," Under the Mexican immigration system, large tracts of land have been allocated to empresarios, who recruit settlers from the United States, Europe and the interior of Mexico."
18651,42,texas,18651,"The first concession, at Moses Austin, was handed over to his son Stephen F. Austin after his death."

18656,42,texas,18656,"By 1834, the population had risen to about 37,800, with only 7,800 people of Mexican origin."
18657,42,texas,18657," Most of those first settlers who arrived with Austin and shortly afterwards were less than lucky people in life, as Texas was devoid of the comforts found elsewhere in Mexico and the United States during this period."
18658,42,texas,18658,"The young settler of Texas, David B. Edwards, described his comrades Texans as being ""banished from the pleasures of life."""

18689,42,texas,18689," With broad popular support, Texas first requested annexation to the United States in 1836, but its status as a slave country caused its admission to controversy and was initially rejected."

19406,43,utah,19406,In 1875 they published their books independently.
19407,43,utah,19407," These books and the conferences of Ann Eliza Young were credited with the adoption by the United States Congress of anti-polygamy laws by newspapers across the United States as recorded in ""The Ann Eliza Young Vindicator"", a brochure that detailed Ms Young's travels and the warm reception throughout her conference tour."
19408,43,utah,19408,"T. B. H. Stenhouse, former polygamous of Utah Mormon, missionary of Mormon for thirteen years and owner of the Salt Lake City newspaper, finally left Utah and wrote The Rocky Mountain Saints."

19436,43,utah,19436,"Transport management and urbanization are important policy issues, as development consumes agricultural and wilderness land, and transport is a major cause of poor air quality in Utah."
19437,43,utah,19437,Utah is known for its natural diversity and has features ranging from arid deserts with sand dunes to flowering pine forests in mountain valleys.
19438,43,utah,19438,"It is a rugged and geographically diverse state with the convergence of three distinct geological regions: the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin and the Colorado Plateau."

19448,43,utah,19448,It extends approximately from the city of Brigham at the north end to Nephi at the south end.
19449,43,utah,19449," Approximately 75 per cent of the state population lives in this corridor, and population growth is rapid."
19450,43,utah,19450,Western Utah is mainly an arid desert with a basin and a range topography.
19451,43,utah,19451,Small mountain ranges and rough terrain punctuate the landscape.
19452,43,utah,19452,"The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being relatively flat after once forming the bed of the old Lake Bonneville."
19453,43,utah,19453,"The Great Salt Lake, Lake Utah, Lake Sevier and Lake Rush are all remnants of this former freshwater lake that once covered most of the Eastern Great Basin."
19454,43,utah,19454,"To the west of the Great Lake of Salt, which extends to the Nevada border, is the arid desert of the Great Lake of Salt."
19455,43,utah,19455,"An exception to this aridity is Snake Valley, which is (relatively) lush due to the large springs and wetlands fed by groundwater from snowmelt in the Snake Range, Deep Creek Range and other high mountains west of the Snake Valley."
19456,43,utah,19456,Great Basin National Park is located just above the Nevada state line in the south of the Snake Range.
19457,43,utah,19457,"One of the most impressive but least visited attractions in western Utah is Notch Peak, the highest limestone cliff in North America, located west of Delta."
19458,43,utah,19458," Most of the picturesque landscapes of the south and south-east (especially the Colorado Plateau region) are sandstone, particularly Kayenta sandstone and Navajo sandstone."
19459,43,utah,19459,"The Colorado River and its tributaries flow through sandstone, creating some of the most striking and wildest terrains in the world (the area around the confluence of the Colorado and Green rivers was the last to be mapped in the lower 48 United States)."
19460,43,utah,19460,Wind and rain have also carved the soft sandstone for millions of years.
19461,43,utah,19461," Canyons, gulls, arches, pinnacles, buttocks, bluffs and mesas are common in south-central and southeastern Utah."
19462,43,utah,19462," This land is the central feature of protected state and federal national parks such as Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion, Cedar Breaks, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Hovenweep and Natural Bridges National Monuments, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (popular tourist destination site, Powell Lake), Dead Horse Point and Goblin Valley State Parks, and Monument Valley."

19465,43,utah,19465," Eastern Utah (northern quarter) is a high-altitude area covered mainly by plateaus and basins, in particular the Tavaputs plateau and the San Rafael swell, which remain largely inaccessible, and the Uinta basin, where the majority of the eastern Utah population lives."
19466,43,utah,19466,"Economies are dominated by mining, oil shale, oil and natural gas drilling, ranching and recreation."

19473,43,utah,19473,"Dixie quickly became a popular destination for recreation and retirement, and the population was growing rapidly."
19474,43,utah,19474," Although the Wasatch Mountains end at Mount Nebo near Nephi, a complex series of mountain ranges extend south of the southern end of the range at the bottom of the Utah spine."
19475,43,utah,19475," Just north of Dixie and east of Cedar City is the highest ski resort in the State, Brian Head."

19477,43,utah,19477,"More than 70 percent of the land is either BLM, Utah State Trustland, or US National Forest, US National Park, US National Monument, National Recreation Area or US Wilderness Area."
19478,43,utah,19478,Utah is the only state where every county contains a national forest.
19479,43,utah,19479,"Utah has a dry, semi-arid climate in the desert, although its many mountains have a wide variety of climates, the highest points in the Uinta mountains being above the wood line."
19480,43,utah,19480, Dry weather is the result of the state's location in the rain shadow of Sierra Nevada in California.
19481,43,utah,19481, Half of the east state is in the rain shadow of the Wasatch Mountains.
19482,43,utah,19482,"The main source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually on the major Pacific storm trail from October to May."
19483,43,utah,19483,"In summer, the state, particularly the south and east of Utah, is on the monsoon moisture trail from the Gulf of California."
19484,43,utah,19484," Most plain areas receive less than 12 inches (305 mm) of precipitation per year, although corridor I-15, including the densely populated Wasatch Front, receives approximately 15 inches (381 mm)."
19485,43,utah,19485,"The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest region in the state, with less than 5 inches (127 mm)."
19486,43,utah,19486,"Snowfall is common in all valleys, except in remote southern valleys."
19487,43,utah,19487," Although St. George receives only about 3 inches (76 mm) per year, Salt Lake City sees about 60 inches (1,524 mm), increased by effect snow Lake of Great Salt Lake, which increases total snowfall to the south, south-east and east of the lake."
19488,43,utah,19488," Some areas of the Wasatch chain on the lake effect trail receive up to 500 inches (12,700 mm) per year."
19489,43,utah,19489, This micro-climate of increased snowfall from Great Salt Lake extends throughout the vicinity of the lake.
19490,43,utah,19490,The cotton canyons adjacent to Salt Lake City are located in the right position to receive more precipitation from the lake.
19491,43,utah,19491,"The ever-deep snowfowl led the Utah ski industry to adopt the slogan ""the greatest snow on earth"" in the 1980s."
19492,43,utah,19492,"In winter, temperature inversions are a common phenomenon in Utah basins and valleys, resulting in thick fog and fog that can last for weeks at a time, particularly in the Uintah basin."
19493,43,utah,19493," Although at other times of the year its air quality is good, winter reversals give Salt Lake City one of the worst winter pollution in the country."
19494,43,utah,19494,"Previous studies have shown a widespread decline in snow quantity above Utah, accompanied by a decline in the snow-precipitation ratio, while anecdotal claims have been made that the measured changes in the amount of snow in Utah are misleading and do not reflect actual changes."
19495,43,utah,19495,"A 2012 study found that the proportion of winter precipitation (January to March) falling as snow has decreased by nine per cent over the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in precipitation and a slight decrease in snowfall."
19496,43,utah,19496," Meanwhile, the depth of snow observed in Utah decreased and was accompanied by a steady decrease in snow cover and surface albedo."
19497,43,utah,19497," Weather systems likely to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number, with those producing snowfall decreasing at a much higher rate."
19498,43,utah,19498,"Utah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its altitude, and very hot summers on a state scale (except for mountain areas and high mountain valleys)."
19499,43,utah,19499,"Utah is usually protected from major cold air explosions by mountains in the north and east of the state, although major Arctic explosions may sometimes reach the state."
19500,43,utah,19500, January average high temperatures range from about 30°F (−1°C) in some northern valleys to about 55°F (13°C) in St. George.
19501,43,utah,19501," Temperatures below 0°F (−18°C) should be expected occasionally in most regions of the state in most years, although some regions often see it (for example, the city of Randolph has an average of about fifty days a year with such low temperatures)."
19502,43,utah,19502,"In July, average peaks ranged from about 85 to 100°F (29 to 38°C)."
19503,43,utah,19503," However, low humidity and high altitude usually result in large temperature variations, resulting in cool nights on most summer days."
19504,43,utah,19504,"The record temperature in Utah was 118°F (48°C), recorded south of St. George on 4 July 2007, and the low record was -69°F (−56°C), recorded at Peter Sinks in the Northern Bear Mountains of Utah on 1 February 1985."
19505,43,utah,19505," However, the record level for a inhabited area was −49°F (−45°C) at Woodruff on 12 December 1932."
19506,43,utah,19506,"Utah, like most western United States, has a few days of thunderstorms."
19507,43,utah,19507,"On average, there are less than 40 days of stormy activity in the year, although these storms may be briefly intense when they occur."
19508,43,utah,19508," They are more likely to occur during the monsoon season, from mid-July to mid-September, especially in southern and eastern Utah."
19509,43,utah,19509," Dry lightning strikes and generally dry weather often triggers forest fires in the summer, while intense thunderstorms can cause flash floods, especially in the rugged southern Utah terrain."
19510,43,utah,19510," Although spring is the wettest season in northern Utah, late summer is the wettest time for much of the south and east of the state."
19511,43,utah,19511,"The tornadoes are rare in Utah, with an average of two striking the state each year, rarely more EF1 intensity."
19512,43,utah,19512,"An exception to note, however, was the unprecedented F2 Salt Lake City Tornado that moved directly to downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999, killing one person, wounding another sixty, and causing approximately $170 million in damage."
19513,43,utah,19513,"The only other deadly tornado reported in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on July 6, 1884."
19514,43,utah,19514,"The last tornado of intensity above (E)F0 occurred on September 8, 2002, when an F2 tornado hit Manti."
19515,43,utah,19515,"On 11 August 1993, an F3 tornado struck the Uinta Mountains north of Duchesne at an altitude of 10,500 feet (3,200 m), causing damage to a Scout camp."
19516,43,utah,19516, This is the strongest tornado ever recorded in Utah.

19846,44,vermont,19846," Subsequently, approximately 400 million years ago, the second period of mountain construction created Green Mountain peaks that ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 feet (4,600 to 6,100 metres), three to four times their current height and were comparable to those of the Himalayas."
19847,44,vermont,19847,"The geological pressures that created these peaks remain evident as Thrust Champlain, which runs from north to south to west of the mountains (now the east bank of Lake Champlain)."
19848,44,vermont,19848, This is an example of a surge of geological faults where the bedrock is pushed above the formation of more recent rocks.

20006,44,vermont,20006,"It found that many State legislatures had not been redistributed and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated urban and industrial areas."
20007,44,vermont,20007," Furthermore, it found that many States had an upper chamber based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties."
20008,44,vermont,20008, This has given disproportionate power to rural counties and low population density.
20009,44,vermont,20009,The Court held that there was no basis for such a structure.
20010,44,vermont,20010,Major changes in political distribution took place in Vermont and other affected States.

20047,44,vermont,20047,"A decreasing portion of the Vermont population, generally rural and masculine, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g.:"
20048,44,vermont,20048," cows with an elevated vowel like [khyz] and ride with a sustained vowel, somewhat rounded like [yyd])."
20049,44,vermont,20049," Eastern New England English, also present in New Hampshire, Maine and Eastern Massachusetts, was common in eastern Vermont in the mid-20th century and before, but became rare."
20050,44,vermont,20050," This accent reduces the sound r to words ending in r (the farmer sounds like ""farm-uh"") and adds a r sound to some words ending in vowel (idea sounds like ""idee-er"") was common."

21064,46,washington,21064,"The frequent rain and cloud cover of western Washington is an important plot point in the popular Twilight book, which is located in western Washington precisely because of its relative lack of sun."
21065,46,washington,21065,"The eastern part of Washington – the eastern part of the state of the Cascades – has a relatively dry climate, in distinct contrast to the western side."
21066,46,washington,21066,It includes large areas of semi-arid steppe and some really arid deserts in the rain shadow of the Cascades
21067,46,washington,21067," Despite limited rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important activity in most of eastern Washington, as the soil is very productive and irrigation, assisted by dams along the Columbia River, is quite widespread."

21069,46,washington,21069,"The major cities are all located on the banks of rivers or lakes, most of which are named after the river or lake they adhere to."

21074,46,washington,21074,"A Mediterranean climate prevails in western Washington, and a much drier semi-arid climate reigns east of the Cascade chain."
21075,46,washington,21075,"The main factors that determine Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent high-pressure and low-pressure systems in the northern Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In the spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the northern Pacific Ocean, causing a clockwise spiral of air."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means that the prevailing northwestern winds bring relatively fresh air and a predictable dry season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In autumn and winter, a system of low-pressure cyclones takes over in the North Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,"The air flies in the opposite direction from the clockwise direction, so Washington's prevailing winds come from the southwest and bring relatively warm and humid air masses and a predictable wet season."
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is commonly used to describe atmospheric fluvial events, where repeated storm systems are driven by this persistent cyclone in the tropical and near-tropical regions of the Pacific in the northwest Pacific."

21083,46,washington,21083,"The lowest officially recorded Seattle temperature is 0°F (−18°C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-lying areas at about three hours from Seattle recorded lows as cold as −48°F (−44°C)."
21084,46,washington,21084, Southern oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085," During the El Niño phase, the jet enters the United States further south through California, so that late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snow."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet across the Northwest Pacific, which means that Washington has more rain and snow than average."
21087,46,washington,21087,"In 2006, the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group published The Impacts of Climate Change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities presented, given the possibility of rising global temperatures and their effects on Washington's state."

21091,46,washington,21091,"The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the largest annual snowfalls (in some locations, more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres of water equivalent) in the country."
21092,46,washington,21092,"In the rain shadow east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093, Precipitation then increases eastward towards the Rocky Mountains (approximately 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and waterfalls aggravate this climate pattern by causing an orographical uplift of blowing air masses inside the Pacific Ocean, resulting in high levels of precipitation on the wind side of the mountains and low levels on the left side."
21095,46,washington,21095, This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic mountains and the Cascade Range.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases, wind slopes facing the southwest receive high precipitation and mild and cool temperatures."
21097,46,washington,21097," Although the Puget Sound lowlands are known for cloud and rain in winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher altitudes."

21102,46,washington,21102," Thus, instead of rainforests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry grasslands, shrub steppe and sand dunes."

21471,47,west_virginia,21471," There was also the Iroquoian Susquehannock in the area approximately east of the Monongahela River and north of the Monongahela National Forest, a possible tribe called the Sendrondoa, or Shenandoah, in the Shenandoah Valley and the easternmost point of the state may have been home to the Manahoac people."
21472,47,west_virginia,21472,"The Monongahelas were perhaps the same as a people known as Calicua, or Cali."
21473,47,west_virginia,21473," Perhaps the following was the same tribe: Moneton, Moheton, Senatorndoa, Tomahitan."

21477,47,west_virginia,21477,"In the 1750s, when the Mingo Senatorca seceded from the Iroquois and returned to the Ohio River Valley, they claim that this tribe merged with them."
21478,47,west_virginia,21478,"The Shawnee also arrived, but were mainly stationed in the former Monongahela territory until about 1750, but extended their influence throughout the Ohio area."

21480,47,west_virginia,21480,"The Erie, which were driven out of Ohio around 1655, are now known to be the same as the Westo, which invaded South Carolina before being destroyed in the 1680s."
21481,47,west_virginia,21481," If so, their path would have led them to cross West Virginia."
21482,47,west_virginia,21482,"The historical movement of the Tutelo, as well as the carbon dating for the Ancient Forts seem to correspond to the given period of 1655–70 as the time of their removal."
21483,47,west_virginia,21483,"The Susquehannocks were the first participants in the Beaver Wars, but they were cut off from the Ohio River by the Iroquois around 1630 and found themselves in terrible straits."

21486,47,west_virginia,21486,"The Siwan tribes settled there in North Carolina and later returned as a tribe, known as the Blackfoot of the East, or Christannas."
21487,47,west_virginia,21487,The Westo did not secure the territory he conquered.
21488,47,west_virginia,21488," Even before they left, the displaced indigenous people from the south flooded into freshly conquered areas and took care of them."
21489,47,west_virginia,21489, They became known as Shattaras or West Virginia Cherokees.
21490,47,west_virginia,21490," They appropriated themselves and merged with the Monetons, who began to designate themselves as the Mohetons."
21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicua also began to designate themselves as Cherokees shortly afterwards, showing an apparent additional fusion."
21492,47,west_virginia,21492, These Shattaras were closely related to the tribes that formed in the south following the Westo – the Yuchi and Cherokee.
21493,47,west_virginia,21493," From 1715 to 1717, the Yamasee War broke out."
21494,47,west_virginia,21494,The senator allegedly took sides for the Yuchi and was allegedly destroyed by Yamasee's allies.
21495,47,west_virginia,21495,"So, if Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, it would mean the collapse of the Shattara-Moneton culture."
21496,47,west_virginia,21496," Another tribe that appeared in the area was Canaragay, or Kanawha."
21497,47,west_virginia,21497," Later, they moved to Maryland and merged into colonial culture."

21500,47,west_virginia,21500," According to some sources, the Knights of Governor Alexander Spotswood's Golden Horseshoe Expedition in 1716 (for which the state named Golden Horseshoe Competition for 8th grades) had entered Pendleton County; however, modern historians interpret the original accounts of the trip as suggesting that none of the expedition's riders ventured much more west of the Blue Ridge Mountains than Harrisonburg, Virginia."
21501,47,west_virginia,21501,"John Van Metre, an Indian trader, entered the northern part in 1725."
21502,47,west_virginia,21502," That same year, German settlers from Pennsylvania founded New Mecklenburg, the present Shepherdstown, on the Potomac River, and others followed."
21503,47,west_virginia,21503,"King Charles II of England, in 1661, granted a company of gentlemen of the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, known as the north neck."
21504,47,west_virginia,21504,"Thomas Fairfax, Cameron's 6th Lord Fairfax finally took possession of this concession, and in 1746 a stone was erected at the source of the Potomac River north branch to mark the western boundary of its concession."
21505,47,west_virginia,21505, Much of the land was surveyed by young George Washington between 1748 and 1751.

21509,47,west_virginia,21509," Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, although they were hindered by the resistance of the Amerindians."
21510,47,west_virginia,21510," Few Amerindians live permanently within the present state boundaries, but the area is a common hunting ground, traversed by many trails."
21511,47,west_virginia,21511," During the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe), the Indian allies of the French almost destroyed the scattered British colonies."
21512,47,west_virginia,21512," Shortly before the American Revolutionary War, in 1774 the Governor of the Crown of Virginia, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, led a force on the mountains."

21514,47,west_virginia,21514,"At the treaty of Camp Charlotte concluding the Dunmore War, Cornstalk agreed to recognize the Ohio River as the new border with the ""long knives."""
21515,47,west_virginia,21515,"In 1776, however, the Shawnee were back at war, joining the Chickamauga, a Cherokee band known for the area where they lived."
21516,47,west_virginia,21516,The Amerindian attacks on settlers continued until the end of the American revolutionary war.
21517,47,west_virginia,21517," During the war, settlers in western Virginia were generally active Whigs and many served in the continental army."
21518,47,west_virginia,21518," However, the Claypool rebellion of 1780–81, in which a group of men refused to pay the taxes imposed by the Continental Army, witnessed the tenacity of the war in what became West Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,The social conditions in western Virginia were quite different from those in the eastern part of the state.
21520,47,west_virginia,21520,"The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable portion of immigration came through Pennsylvania and included Germans, Scottish-Irish Protestants, and settlers from more northerly states."
21521,47,west_virginia,21521,The eastern and southern counties were mainly established by the eastern Virginians.
21522,47,west_virginia,21522," During the American Revolution, the movement for the creation of a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was presented in Congress, on the grounds that the mountains had an almost impossible barrier to the east."
21523,47,west_virginia,21523,"The wilderness of the country makes slavery unprofitable, and time only increases the social, political, economic and cultural differences (see Tuckahoe-Cohee) between the two sections of Virginia."
21524,47,west_virginia,21524,"In 1829, a constitutional convention was convened in Richmond to consider reforms to the outdated constitution of Virginia."
21525,47,west_virginia,21525,Philip Doddridge from Brooke County defended the cause of the Western Virginians who sought a more democratic government framework.
21526,47,west_virginia,21526," However, Western reforms have been rejected by the leaders of the Eastern Alleghenies who ""dive into political power in an effort to preserve their way of plantation dependent on the enslavement of the Blacks""."
21527,47,west_virginia,21527, Virginia's leaders maintained a property qualification to effectively deny the right to vote to poor farmers in the West whose families have done much of the agricultural work themselves.
21528,47,west_virginia,21528,"In addition, the 1829–30 convention granted to the counties that held slaves the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population by allocating state representation in the House of Representatives of the United States."
21529,47,west_virginia,21529,"As a result, all but one of the counties west of the Alleghenies voted to reject the constitution, which was nonetheless adopted because of the support of the East."
21530,47,west_virginia,21530,The inability of the Eastern planter elite to carry out constitutional reforms exacerbated the East-West sectarianism existing in Virginia and contributed to its subsequent division.
21531,47,west_virginia,21531,"The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850-1951, the Reform Convention, addressed a number of issues of importance to the Western Virginians."
21532,47,west_virginia,21532,He extended the vote to all white men aged 21 years and older.
21533,47,west_virginia,21533,"The governor, the lieutenant governor, the judiciary, the sheriffs and other county officers were to be elected by public vote."

21535,47,west_virginia,21535," Representation in the House of Delegates was distributed on the basis of the 1850 census, with only whites."
21536,47,west_virginia,21536,"The representation of Senators was arbitrarily set at 50 seats, with the West receiving twenty and the East thirty senators."
21537,47,west_virginia,21537," This was made acceptable to the West by a provision which required the General Assembly to resume its representation on the basis of the white population in 1865, or to refer the matter to a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the East has also given itself a tax advantage by requiring a real and real property tax, with the exception of slaves."
21539,47,west_virginia,21539," Slaves under the age of 12 were not taxed and slaves over the age of 12 were taxed at only $300, a fraction of their real value."
21540,47,west_virginia,21540,"Small farmers, however, had all their property, their animals and their land taxed at full value."
21541,47,west_virginia,21541," Despite this tax and the absence of internal improvements in the West, the vote was 75,748 in favour and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542," Most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the west."
21543,47,west_virginia,21543,"In view of these differences, many in the West had long considered a separate state."
21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men such as attorney Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont had long fought under the political domination of the slave owners of Tidewater and Piedmont."
21545,47,west_virginia,21545,"In addition to the differences regarding the abolition of slavery, he and his allies felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds for the necessary internal improvements in the West, such as spindles and railroads."
21546,47,west_virginia,21546,West Virginia was the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate State (Virginia) during the American Civil War.
21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the 1861 Virginia Secession Agreement voted for the secession of the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwest corner (who eventually became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favour of the secession order, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548," Almost immediately after this vote, a mass meeting in Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to an assembly to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"At the first meeting, 425 delegates from 25 counties attended, although more than a third of the delegates were from the North Panhandle region."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550, Soon there was a division of feelings.
21551,47,west_virginia,21551," Some delegates led by John S. Carlile favoured the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been adopted by the necessary referendum (as happened on 23 May), such action would constitute a revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if the Virginians passed the secession order (of which there was little doubt), another convention comprising the elected members of the legislature would meet at Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On 23 May 1861 the secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in Western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted in favour."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on 11 June and stated that, since the Secession Convention had been called without the consent of the people, all its actions were null and void and that all those who had acceded to it had left their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never really elected by public vote to act on behalf of West Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of its 103 members, 33 had been elected to the General Assembly of Virginia on 23 May."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557," These included United States senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and some who had left their offices to meet at Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558," Other members ""were chosen in an even more irregular way – some at mass meetings, others by county committee, and others were apparently appointed by themselves."""
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,A law for the reorganization of the government was adopted on 19 June.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The delegates of the next day's assembly chose Francis H. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, and elected other officers from a rival state government and two U.S. senators (Willy and Carlile) to replace the secessionists before the adjournment."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,"The federal government in Washington, D.C. quickly recognized the new government and sat on both new senators."
21562,47,west_virginia,21562, Thus there were two state governments in Virginia: one promising allegiance to the United States and the other to Confederation.
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The Second Wheeling Convention had been suspended until 6 August, then met on 20 August and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new State and a convention to establish a constitution if the vote were to be favourable."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"In the elections of 24 October 1861, 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The results of the elections were questioned, as the Union army occupying the area and the Union troops were stationed in many polling stations to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"It was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in confederate soldiers' camps, which elected rival state officials such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567, Most pro-state votes came from 16 counties around the North Panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"More than 50,000 votes had been cast on the Secession Order, but the vote on State status had not exceeded 19,000."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, home to Wheeling, only a quarter of registered voters voted."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote, since two-thirds of West Virginia's territory had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,The majority of votes in the counties in favour of secession were cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572," Despite this controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to draft a new Constitution for the new State, beginning on 26 November 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573," During this constitutional convention, one Mr Lamb from Ohio County and one Mr Carskadon claimed that, in Hampshire County, out of only 195 votes, 39 were expressed by state citizens; the others were illegally launched by Union soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One of the key figures has been Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools, as well as to limit the movement of slaves to the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The proposal for education was successful, but the convention presented the proposals for slavery before completing its work on 18 February 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution is more inspired by Ohio than Virginia, adopting a model of township government rather than Virginia's ""courthouse clicks"" than Carlile criticizes, and a compromise required by the Kanawha region (lawyers Charleston Benjamin Smith and Brown) allows counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railways or other improvement agencies."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578,"The resulting instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on April 11, 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,"On 13 May 1862, the state parliament of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state."
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,A request for admission to the Union was made to Congress by Senator Waitman Willey of the restored Virginia government.
21581,47,west_virginia,21581," However, Senator Carlile tried to sabotage the bill, first trying to widen the boundaries of the new state to include the Shenandoah Valley and then defeat the Willey Amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling law was approved by President Abraham Lincoln, who admitted West Virginia, provided that a provision for the progressive abolition of slavery was included in his constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle had urged in the Wheeling Intelligencer and also wrote to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584," While many felt that West Virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln expressed his opinion on the admission of West Virginia by concluding that ""the body that consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Virginia Legislative Assembly"" and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and timely."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,The convention was reconvened on 12 February 1863 and the request for the abolition of the federal enabling legislation was met.
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,"The revised Constitution was adopted on 26 March 1863 and on 20 April 1863 President Lincoln issued a proclamation in which he admitted the State 60 days later, on 20 June 1863."
21587,47,west_virginia,21587," Meanwhile, officers for the new State were chosen, while the Government."
21588,47,west_virginia,21588,"Pierpont moved his pro-Union capital Virginia to Alexandria occupied by the Union, where he affirmed and exercised jurisdiction over all the other counties of Virginia on federal lines."
21589,47,west_virginia,21589,The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new State was then referred to the United States Supreme Court in Virginia v. West Virginia.
21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties, located on the Potomac east of the mountains, in 1863, with the consent of the reorganized Virginia government, voted in favour of annexation to West Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591, Many voters in counties strongly supportive of secessionists were absent from the Confederate army at the time of the vote and refused to recognize the transfer upon their return.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly abrogated the act of secession and, in 1866, brought an action against West Virginia asking the court to declare the counties a part of Virginia, which reportedly declared the admission of West Virginia as an unconstitutional state."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593," Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress adopted a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Western Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595," During the civil war, General Union forces George B. McClellan took possession of most of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating in the Battle of Rich Mountain, and control of the Union was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863, General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 confederates, raided much of the state and burned the Pierpont Library, although Senator Willey fled their capture."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,"Bands of guerrillas burned and looted in some sections, and were not completely removed until after the end of the war."
21598,47,west_virginia,21598, Eastern Panhandle counties have been more affected by the war as military control of the area has changed hands several times.
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The region that became West Virginia did indeed provide about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, about 22,000 to 25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to remove voting rights from the Confederacy's return in order to maintain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said that if it were not enacted, he would lose the 500-vote election."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of the Confederates could also be confiscated and, in 1866, a constitutional amendment was adopted which deprived all those who had helped and comforted Confederation."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution prompted a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,"The Democratic Party gained control in 1870, and in 1871 the 1866 constitutional amendment was repealed."
21605,47,west_virginia,21605,"The first steps towards this change had, however, been taken by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,"On August 22, 1872, a completely new constitution was adopted."
21607,47,west_virginia,21607," From the reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states challenged the state's share of the debts of the pre-war government of Virginia, which had been primarily committed to finance public infrastructure improvements, such as canals, roads and railways, under the direction of the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,"The Virginians, led by former Confederate General William Mahone, formed a political coalition based on this: the Adjuster Party."
21609,47,west_virginia,21609," Although the first constitution of West Virginia provided for the taking over of some of Virginia's debt, the negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were unsuccessful and, in 1871, Virginia financed two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily attributed the rest to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally resolved in 1915, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The final instalment of this amount was paid in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612," Following the reconstruction, the new 35th State benefited from the exploitation of its mineral resources more than any other economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613," Saltpeter caves had been used throughout Appalachia for ammunition production; the border between West Virginia and Virginia included the Saltpeter Trail, a chain of limestone caves containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were returned and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail extended from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the road in the city of Union, Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615," Nearly half of these caves are on the west side of Virginia, including the organ cave and the Haynes Cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"In the late 18th century, Haynes Cave saline miners found large animal bones in the deposits."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617," They were sent by a local historian and a border soldier, Colonel John Stuart, to Thomas Jefferson."
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were called Megalonyx jeffersonii, or big claw, and were known as Jefferson's three-finger laziness."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,It was declared an official fossil of the state of West Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The official rock of the state of West Virginia is bituminous coal, and the official gemstone of the state is silicified fossil of the Mississippi Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621," Limestone has also produced a useful, usually small, quarry industry and softer, high-calcium seams have been burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622," This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years, a specific portion of the C & O railway transported limestone to Clifton Forge, Virginia, as an industrial stream."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"The extraction of salt had been under way since the 18th century, although it played largely at the time of the American civil war, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valuable commodity of the forces of the first Confederate, then of the Union."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In the following years, more sophisticated extraction methods would restore the role of West Virginia as the leading salt producer."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625," However, in the second half of the 19th century there was an even larger treasure that was not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626,It would fuel much of the industrial revolution in the United States and the steam ships of many of the world's marines.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627,The inhabitants (indigenous and early European settlers) had long known the underlying coal and could use it for heating and fuel.
21628,47,west_virginia,21628," However, for a long time, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629," After the war, with the new railway lines came a practical method of transporting large quantities of coal to the expansion of American and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630,"As the anthracite mines in northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began playing during the same period, investors and industrialists focused their interest on West Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted have studied potential coal deposits and invested in land-based and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) across the state to the new town of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River coalfield.
21633,47,west_virginia,21633," Soon, the C&O was building its huge coal pier at Newport News, Virginia, on the Great Harbour of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new owners of the former Atlantic Railway, Mississippi and Ohio (AM&O), which extended across southern Virginia from Norfolk, had clear views of the state of the mountains, where the landowners owned large lands."
21635,47,west_virginia,21635," Their railway was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railway city was developed in Roanoke to manage the planned expansion."
21636,47,west_virginia,21636," After his new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party travelled on horseback and first-hand saw the rich bituminous seam of coal, which Kimball's wife named Pocahontas, the N&W reoriented his expansion project to the west to reach him."
21637,47,west_virginia,21637," Soon, the N&W also sailed from new coal jetties on Hampton Roads."
21638,47,west_virginia,21638,"In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and western railway lines, the important coal centre of Bluefield, West Virginia, was founded."
21639,47,west_virginia,21639,"The capital of the Pocahontas coalfield, this city will remain the largest city in the southern part of the state for decades."
21640,47,west_virginia,21640,"She shares a sister city of the same name, Bluefield, Virginia."
21641,47,west_virginia,21641,"In the northern part of the state and elsewhere, the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities."
21642,47,west_virginia,21642,The B&O has developed coal jetties in Baltimore and several locations in the Great Lakes.
21643,47,west_virginia,21643," Other major coal railways were the Western Maryland Railway (WM), Southern Railway (SOU) and the Louisville and Nashville Railway (L&N)."
21644,47,west_virginia,21644,"One delayer, the Virginian Railway (VGN), is particularly notable."
21645,47,west_virginia,21645,"By 1900, only the most rugged terrain in southwestern Virginia was at any distance from existing railways and mining activities."
21646,47,west_virginia,21646,"In this area west of the New River coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties, the Winding Gulf coalfield was later promoted as a billion-dollar coalfield."
21647,47,west_virginia,21647,"A protégé of Dr. Ansted was William Nelson Page (1854–1932), civil engineer and mining director in Fayette County."
21648,47,west_virginia,21648," Former West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land ""as a farmer knows a field."""
21649,47,west_virginia,21649," Starting in 1898, Page teamed up with northern and European investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area."
21650,47,west_virginia,21650," They acquired extensive land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short rail line chartered to stretch between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka – a distance of about 80 miles (130 km)."
21651,47,west_virginia,21651," Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive marine transportation contract by either railway, the managers of the two major railways did not appreciate the plan."
21652,47,west_virginia,21652,"In secret collusion, everyone refused to negotiate favourable rates with Page, and they did not offer to buy their railway, as they had many other short lines."
21653,47,west_virginia,21653," However, if the presidents of C&O and N&W thought that they could kill the Page project, they had to be wrong."
21654,47,west_virginia,21654,"One of Page's silent investor-partners was the million-dollar industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a director of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust and a former manager of natural resource development and transportation."
21655,47,west_virginia,21655,"Master of competitive ""war,"" Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his efforts and also had ""deep pockets""."
21656,47,west_virginia,21656," Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks to the east of Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost."
21657,47,west_virginia,21657,"At the completion of the Virginian Railway (VGN) in 1909, as many as three railways were shipping ever-increasing volumes of coal for the export of Hampton Roads."
21658,47,west_virginia,21658,West Virginia coal was also heavily solicited in the Great Lakes harbours.
21659,47,west_virginia,21659,"The NGV and N&W have finally become elements of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the well-developed 21st century NGV lanes continue to provide a favourable gradient for Hampton roads."
21660,47,west_virginia,21660,"As coal mining and related work became important employment activities in the state, working conditions, safety issues and economic concerns arose."
21661,47,west_virginia,21661," Even in the twenty-first century, mining safety and environmental concerns continue to pose problems for the state, whose coal continues to supply power plants in many other states."
21662,47,west_virginia,21662," Coal is not the only precious mineral found in West Virginia, since the state was the site of the discovery in 1928 of the 34.48-carat Jones diamond (6.896 g)."
21663,47,west_virginia,21663," Located in the Appalachian Range, West Virginia covers an area of 62,754.8 km2, with 62,361.0 km2 of land and 393.8 km2 of water, making it the 41st state of the United States."
21664,47,west_virginia,21664,"West Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest, and Kentucky in the southwest."
21665,47,west_virginia,21665," Its longest border is with Virginia 381 miles (613 km), followed by Ohio 243 miles (391 km), Maryland 174 miles (280 km), Pennsylvania 118 miles (190 km), and Kentucky 79 miles (127 km)."
21666,47,west_virginia,21666,"West Virginia is entirely located in the Appalachian region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi (""The mounttains are always free"")."
21667,47,west_virginia,21667,Elevations and robustness fall close to large rivers such as the Ohio River or the Shenandoah River.
21668,47,west_virginia,21668, Approximately 75% of the state is located in the Cumberland Plateau and the Allegheny Plateau.
21669,47,west_virginia,21669," Although the terrain is not high, the plateau area is extremely rugged in most regions."
21670,47,west_virginia,21670,"The average elevation of West Virginia is about 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, the highest of all U.S. states east of Mississippi."
21671,47,west_virginia,21671,"On the eastern line of the state with Virginia, peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region result in an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those in northern New England and eastern Canada."
21672,47,west_virginia,21672,"The highest point in the state is the top of Spruce Knob, at 1863 feet (1,482 m), and is covered in dense spruce boreal forest at altitudes greater than 4000 feet (1,200 m)."
21673,47,west_virginia,21673, Spruce Knob is located in the Monongahela National Forest and is part of Spruce Knob-Senatorca Rocks National Recreation Area.
21674,47,west_virginia,21674,"In total, six wild areas are also found in the forest."
21675,47,west_virginia,21675," Outside the forest to the south, the New River Gorge is a 300 m deep canyon carved by the New River."
21676,47,west_virginia,21676,The National Parks Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the National Park and the New River Gorge Reserve.
21677,47,west_virginia,21677, Other areas for protection and management include:
21678,47,west_virginia,21678," Most of West Virginia lies in the mixed ecoregion of Appalachian Mesophyte forests, while the high elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie in the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests."
21679,47,west_virginia,21679,"The native vegetation of most of the State was originally a mixed forest of hardwood oak, chestnut, maple, beech and white pine, with American willow and sycamore along the state's waterways."
21680,47,west_virginia,21680," Many of these areas are rich in biodiversity and picturesque beauty, a fact appreciated by native Virginians, who refer to their home as almost heaven (from the song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" by John Denver)."
21681,47,west_virginia,21681," Prior to the song, he was known as ""The Cog State"" (coal, oil and gas) or ""The Mountain State""."
21682,47,west_virginia,21682,"The underlying rock strata are sandstone, shale, bituminous coal deposits, and limestone laid in an environment close to the coast from sediments from mountains to the east in a shallow inland sea to the west."
21683,47,west_virginia,21683," Some beds illustrate a coastal swampy environment, a river delta, shallow waters."
21684,47,west_virginia,21684,"The sea level rose and fell repeatedly in the Mississippi and Pennsylvania eras, giving a variety of rocky strata."
21685,47,west_virginia,21685,"The Appalachians are among the oldest in the world, having formed more than three hundred million years ago."
21686,47,west_virginia,21686,"West Virginia's climate is generally a humid subtropical climate (classification of the climate of Köppen Cfa, except Dfb at higher altitudes) with warm to warm, humid and cold winters, increasing in severity with altitude."
21687,47,west_virginia,21687, Some regions of the southern highlands also have a temperate mountain climate (Köppen Cfb) where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures slightly cooler.
