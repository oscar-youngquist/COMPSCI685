123,0,alabama,123,"In view of this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see the table ""historical populations"" below) decreased by almost half from 1910 to 1920."

136,0,alabama,136, They have retained their former representation in order to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
137,0,alabama,137,"As a result, Jefferson County, home to Birmingham's industrial and economic power, paid more than a third of all tax revenues to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests are constantly underrepresented in the legislature.
139,0,alabama,139,"A 1960 study indicated that, due to rural domination, ""a minority of about 25 per cent of the total population of the State is under the majority control of the Alabama Legislative Assembly""."
140,0,alabama,140,"In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" should be the basis of both chambers of state legislatures and that their districts should be based on population rather than geographic counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislator completed the redistribution of Congress on the basis of the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142," This has benefited urban areas that have developed, as well as the population as a whole that has been underrepresented for more than sixty years."
143,0,alabama,143, Further changes have been made to the establishment of a representative State House and Senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144," African-Americans continued to exert pressure in the 1950s and 1960s to end marginalization and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools should be disaggregated, but Alabama was slow to comply."

147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement experienced remarkable events in Alabama, including the boycott of the Montgomery buses (1955-1956), the Freedom Rides in 1961 and the Selma Marches in Montgomery in 1965."

152,0,alabama,152," These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made changes since the end of the twentieth century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus redistriction case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the general vote for seats representing 180 jurisdictions in Alabama, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155," Voting in general has diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tends to take all the seats."
156,0,alabama,156," Although African-Americans are an important minority in the state, they have not been able to elect representatives in most jurisdictions in general."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of the settlement of this case, five cities and counties of Alabama, including Chilton County, have adopted a cumulative voting system for the election of representatives in multiple-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158, This has resulted in a greater proportional representation of voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County."
160,0,alabama,160,In 1982 the limited vote was first tested in Conecuh County.
161,0,alabama,161," Together, the use of these systems has increased the number of African American women and women elected to local offices, resulting in more representative governments of their citizens."
162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth state of the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of the total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in quantity of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland navigation system in the United States."

176,0,alabama,176,A 300-metre-wide meteorite struck the region about 80 million years ago.
177,0,alabama,177,"The hills just east of Wetumpka city centre present the eroded remains of the impact crater that was projected into the rocky substrate, with the area marked by the crater or the Wetumpka astroblem (""star-wound"") due to the concentric rings of fractures and areas of broken rocks that can be found under the surface."

347,0,alabama,347,"The basic document for the government of Alabama is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901."
348,0,alabama,348," With almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is, according to some, the longest constitution in the world and 40 times longer than the United States Constitution."
349,0,alabama,349, There was a significant movement to rewrite and modernize the Alabama constitution.
350,0,alabama,350," Critics claim that the Alabama constitution maintains a highly centralized power with the state's legislative power, leaving virtually no power in local hands."
351,0,alabama,351, Most counties do not have a rule of origin.
352,0,alabama,352," Any proposed policy changes in various areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, often, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353,A criticism of the current Constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
354,0,alabama,354,The Alabama government is divided into three equal branches.
355,0,alabama,355,"The legislative power is the Legislative Assembly of Alabama, a bicameral assembly composed of the House of Representatives of Alabama, with 105 members, and the Senator of Alabama, with 35 members."
356,0,alabama,356,"The Legislative Assembly is responsible for writing, debating, adopting or rejecting state legislation."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both chambers of Parliament.
358,0,alabama,358,The Legislature has the power to derogate from a veto right by a simple majority (most state legislatures require a two-thirds majority to derogate from a veto right).
359,0,alabama,359," Until 1964, the State elected state senators on a geographical basis per county, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360," Since its constitution was adopted in 1901, it has not redistributed Congressional constituencies; consequently, urbanized areas are heavily underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,Nor has it changed the legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses.
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one voice"", ruling that Congressional districts should be recomposed on the basis of censuses (as the state had already included in its constitution but had not been implemented)."
363,0,alabama,363,"In addition, the Court decided that the two chambers of the legislatures of bicameral States should be distributed by population, as there was no constitutional basis for States to have geographical systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districts, as many countries had systems that were underrepresented in urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365, This has caused decades of under-investment in these areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For example, taxes in Birmingham and Jefferson County provided a third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of the state services."
367,0,alabama,367," Through legislative delegations, the Alabama Legislative Assembly maintained control of county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive branch is responsible for the enforcement and oversight of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is led by the governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370," Other members of the executive branch include the Cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Secretary of State of Alabama, the Treasurer of the State of Alabama and the Auditor of Alabama."
371,0,alabama,371,The present governor is Republican Kay Ivey.
372,0,alabama,372, Members of the Legislative Assembly take up their duties immediately after the November elections.
373,0,alabama,373,"State officials, such as the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General and other constitutional agents, took office the following January."
374,0,alabama,374,The judiciary is responsible for the interpretation of the Constitution of the State and for the application of the law in the criminal and civil cases of the State.
375,0,alabama,375,The highest court in the state is the Supreme Court of Alabama.
376,0,alabama,376,The Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.
377,0,alabama,377," Since the 1980s, judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized."
378,0,alabama,378,The current Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All judges sitting on the Supreme Court of Alabama are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380," There are two intermediate courts of appeal, the Civil Court of Appeal and the Criminal Court of Appeal, and four courts of first instance: the Circuit Court (court of first instance of general jurisdiction) and the District, Provincial and Communal Courts."
381,0,alabama,381, Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an extremely high rate of execution.
382,0,alabama,382,Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In a few years, it imposes more death sentences than Texas, a state with a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384," However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385, Some of his business has been very controversial.
386,0,alabama,386,It was the only State to allow judges to disregard jury decisions when applying a death penalty or not.
387,0,alabama,387, This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,Taxes are collected by the revenue department of Alabama.
389,0,alabama,389,"Alabama collects a tax of 2, 4 or 5% on personal income, depending on the amount earned and production status."
390,0,alabama,390," Taxpayers are permitted to deduct their federal income tax from the state tax of Alabama, even if they take the standard deduction; those who list it can also deduct the FICA tax (social security tax and health insurance)."
391,0,alabama,391,The general rate of State sales tax is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392, Sales tax rates for towns and counties are also added to purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a dinner in Mobile would pay 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"In 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 51 per cent of all government and local revenues, compared with an average of about 36 per cent in the country as a whole."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of the seven states that levy a food tax at the same rate as other goods, and one of the two states (the other being the neighbouring Mississippi) that fully taxes food without any compensatory relief for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most states exempt food products from sales tax or have a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on working poor families is one of the highest in the United States, Alabama, the only state to levy income tax on a family of four people whose income does not exceed $4,600, which is barely one quarter of the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,The Alabama threshold is lowest among the 41 states and the Columbia district with income tax.
399,0,alabama,399,The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400," Overall, the federal, state and local tax burden in Alabama places the state as the second lowest tax burden in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Property taxes are lowest in the U.S.
402,0,alabama,402,The current State Constitution requires an electoral referendum to increase property taxes.
403,0,alabama,403,"As Alabama's tax structure is largely dependent on consumer spending, it is subject to a high variable budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit of $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405,Alabama has 67 counties.
406,0,alabama,406," Each county has its own elected legislative branch, generally known as the County Commission."
407,0,alabama,407,It also has limited executive power in the county.
408,0,alabama,408," Due to the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby and Tuscaloosa) of the state have a limited family regime."
409,0,alabama,409," Instead, most state counties must press the Local Legislation Committee of the State Legislative Assembly for approval of simple local policies, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The State legislator retained power over local governments by refusing to adopt a constitutional amendment establishing the county system of origin, as recommended by the Alabama Constitutional Commission of 1973."
411,0,alabama,411, Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each of the counties.
412,0,alabama,412,"In Baker v. Carr (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court demanded that the two houses have districts established on a population basis and redistributed after each census, in order to apply the principle of ""one man, one voice""."
413,0,alabama,413," Before that, each county was represented by a state senator, leading to under-representation in the State Senate for more urbanized and populated counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had failed to redistribute seats in the state house, affected politics well before the 20th century, not recognizing the growth of industrial cities and urbanised areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The absence of a domestic regime for Alabama counties has led to the proliferation of local legislation allowing counties to do things that are not authorized by the state constitution."
416,0,alabama,416,"The constitution of Alabama has been amended more than 700 times, and nearly a third of the amendments are local in nature, applying only to one county or city."
417,0,alabama,417,"An important part of each legislative session is devoted to local legislation, which removes time and attention from legislators matters of importance to the State as a whole."""
418,0,alabama,418,"Alabama is a state that controls alcoholic beverages, meaning that the state government has a monopoly on the sale of alcohol."
419,0,alabama,419,Alabama's Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state.
420,0,alabama,420,"In total, 25 of the 67 counties are ""dry counties"" that prohibit the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in the counties that allow the sale of alcohol."
421,0,alabama,421," During the post-American civil war reconstruction, Alabama was occupied by federal troops in the third military district under the direction of General John Pope."
422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as Redemptors took control of the republican state government, partly by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423," After 1890, a coalition of white democrat politicians passed laws to separate and deprive African-American residents, a process completed in the provisions of the 1901 constitution."
424,0,alabama,424,The provisions depriving blacks of their right to vote have led to the exclusion of many poor whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"In 1941, more whites than blacks had been denied their right to vote: 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total effects have been greater on the black community, as almost all of its citizens have been deprived of their rights and have been relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law."
427,0,alabama,427," From 1901 to 1960, the state did not redesign electoral districts as the population grew and moved within the state during the urbanization and industrialization of certain regions."
428,0,alabama,428,"As the counties were at the base of the electoral districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated State policy for almost three quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases had to be redistributed in 1972 in order to be represented on an equal footing."
429,0,alabama,429,"The policy of the state of Alabama received national and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, while the whites, bureaucraticly and sometimes violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."
430,0,alabama,430," Governor George Wallace, the only Governor of four state mandates, was a controversial figure who pledged to maintain segregation."
431,0,alabama,431,"It was only after the adoption of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that African Americans regained the capacity to vote, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many jurisdictions, they have continued to be excluded from representation by electoral systems in general, allowing the majority of the population to dominate the elections."
433,0,alabama,433, Some changes have taken place at the county level as a result of judicial challenges aimed at establishing single-member districts that allow for more diverse representation among county councils.
434,0,alabama,434,"In 2007, the Alabama Legislature voted, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing ""deep regret"" over slavery and its continuing impact."

439,0,alabama,439,"For almost a hundred years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with usually only symbolic Republican contestants running for general elections."

Hooper Sr. Hornsby pursued the Alabama and remained in office for almost a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court."

607,1,alaska,607,The climate of Anchorage and south-central Alaska is mild according to Alaskan standards due to the proximity of the area's maritime coast.
608,1,alaska,608," While the region receives less rain than southeastern Alaska, it receives more snow, and the days tend to be clearer."
609,1,alaska,609,"On average, Anchorage receives 16 in (41 cm) precipitation per year, with about 75 in (190 cm) snow, although there are regions in the south-central that receive much more snow."
610,1,alaska,610,It is a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc) due to its short and cool summers.
611,1,alaska,611,The climate of western Alaska is largely determined by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.

621,1,alaska,621,The highest and lowest temperatures recorded in Alaska are both in the interior.
622,1,alaska,622,"The highest is 100°F (38°C) in Fort Yukon (which is only 8 mi or 13 km within the Arctic Circle) on June 27, 1915, making Alaska attached with Hawaii as the state with the lowest temperature in the United States."
623,1,alaska,623,"The lowest official Alaskan temperature is −80°F (−62°C) in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971, which is above the lowest recorded temperature in continental North America (Snag, Yukon, Canada)."

626,1,alaska,626," Precipitation is mild in this part of Alaska, with many locations on average less than 10 cm (25 cm) per year, mostly as snow remaining on the ground almost all year round."
627,1,alaska,627, Many indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of the European peoples in the region.

629,1,alaska,629,"At the location of the Sun Upward River in the Tanana River Valley, Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found."
630,1,alaska,630,The baby's DNA showed that it belonged to a population genetically distinct from other indigenous groups present elsewhere in the New World at the end of the Pleistocene.

640,1,alaska,640, Some researchers believe that the first Russian colony in Alaska was established in the seventeenth century.
641,1,alaska,641," According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several koches of the expedition of Semyon Dejnyov arrived to land in Alaska by storm and founded this colony."
642,1,alaska,642," This hypothesis is based on the testimony of the geographer of Chukchi Nikolai Daurkin, who had visited Alaska in 1764–65 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River, populated by ""bearded men"" who ""pray to icons""."
643,1,alaska,643, Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River.

713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state as official."
714,1,alaska,714," This bill has given them symbolic recognition as official languages, although they have not been adopted for official purposes within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages included in the bill are:
716,1,alaska,716," According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2010, approximately 34% of Alaskans were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people were identified as evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholics and 32,550 as frontline Protestants."

720,1,alaska,720," Alaska has been identified, along with the Pacific Northwest States Washington and Oregon, as the least religious states in the United States, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,"In 1795, the first Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak."
722,1,alaska,722, Marriage to Alaska Native Americans helped Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches have gradually established themselves in Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724, Alaska also has the largest population of Quaker (in percent) in any state.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for which the observance of the halakha could pose particular problems)."
726,1,alaska,726," Alaskan Hindus often share places and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, the Hindus of Alaska established the Sri Gansha temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu temple in Alaska and the most northern Hindu temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728,"It is estimated that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Hindus in Alaska."
729,1,alaska,729,The great majority of Hindus live in Anchorage or Fairbanks.

738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with over 80% of the government's revenues from oil extraction."
739,1,alaska,739," Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is sea fish, mainly salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture represents a tiny fraction of Alaska's economy.
741,1,alaska,741," Agricultural production is mainly intended for consumption in the state and includes nurseries, dairy products, vegetables and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742," Manufacturing is limited, with most food and general goods imported elsewhere."
743,1,alaska,743," Employment primarily affects government and industries such as natural resource extraction, marine transportation and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744," Military bases are an important component of the economy of Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island, and Kodiak."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, enabling the state to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746," Its industrial products include crude oil, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other extractive industries, seafood processing, wood and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747, There is also a growing services and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748, Tourists contributed to the economy by supporting local accommodation.
749,1,alaska,749," Alaska has significant energy resources, although its oil reserves have been extensively depleted."
750,1,alaska,750," Significant oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, in February 2014, Alaska had fallen to fourth place in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota and California."
751,1,alaska,751," Prudhoe Bay on the northern slope of Alaska is still the second-high-yielding oil field in the United States, usually producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although at the beginning of 2014, the North Dakota Bakken Formation produced more than 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752," Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil deposit ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than the huge Athabasca oil sands deposit in Canada, which in 2014 produced approximately 1,500 000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of productive reserves at that rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"The Trans-Alaska Pipeline can carry and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"In addition, large deposits of coal are found in Alaska's bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered gas technically recoverable from natural gas hydrates on the northern slope of Alaska."
756,1,alaska,756, Alaska also offers some of the country's highest hydroelectric potential from its many rivers.
757,1,alaska,757,Large sections of the Alaskan coast also have potential for wind and geothermal energy.
758,1,alaska,758," Alaska's economy relies heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electrical energy and light."
759,1,alaska,759," Although wind and hydroelectric power is abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g.:"
760,1,alaska,760,"It was found not to be cost-effective (at the time of reporting, 2001) due to low fuel prices (less than 50¢/gal), long distances, and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of one gallon of gas in urban Alaska is generally thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally much higher, but vary greatly depending on transportation costs, seasonal peaks of use, nearby oil development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is an appropriation authorized by the Constitution of Oil Revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage the surplus of the state's oil revenues, largely in anticipation of the recently built trans-alaska pipeline network."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the sale of the Prudhoe Bay lease in 1969, for fear that legislators would spend all the proceeds of the sale (i.e. $900 million) at the same time."
764,1,alaska,764,It was then defended by Governor Jay Hammond and State representative Kenai Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765," This is an attractive political perspective since then, diverting revenues that would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaskan Constitution was drafted to discourage the allocation of public funds for a particular purpose.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mainly because of the political climate of mistrust that prevails at the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768," From its initial capital of $734,000, the fund has increased to $50 billion through oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769, Most if not all of the capital is invested conservatively outside Alaska.
770,1,alaska,770," This has led to frequent calls from Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments in Alaska, although such a position has never gained momentum."
771,1,alaska,771," Beginning in 1982, dividends from the annual growth of the fund were paid each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial amount of $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years of payment, since the distribution of payments was retained in a distribution plan proceeding) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time amount of $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772," Each year, the state legislature withdraws 8% of the earnings, gives 3% to the capital for proof of inflation, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all eligible Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To be eligible for the Permanent Fund dividend, one must have lived in the State for at least 12 months, keep his permanent residence subject to authorized absences and not be subject to judicial judgements or criminal convictions that fall within various categories of exclusion or may subject the amount of the payment to civil arrest."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often seen as one of the main examples of a ""core income"" policy around the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the 48 contiguous states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal public servants, particularly employees of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and members on active duty, receive a subsistence allowance usually set at 25% of basic pay because, although the cost of living has decreased, it remains one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska is experiencing extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to relatively limited transportation infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778," Because of the northern climate and the short growing season, there are relatively few farms in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779," Most of the farms are located either in the Matanuska Valley, about 64 km northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 97 km southwest of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make growing seasons productive."
781,1,alaska,781," Primary crops include potatoes, carrots, lettuce and cabbage."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural site, particularly the Delta Junction area, about 160 kilometres south-east of Fairbanks, with a significant concentration of farms growing agronomic crops, mainly to the north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783, This region was largely set aside and developed as part of a state programme led by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784, Crops in the delta region are mainly made up of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"To the west of Fairbanks is another concentration of small farms that deal with restaurants, the hotel and tourism industry, and community farming."
786,1,alaska,786,"In recent years, Alaskan agriculture has seen strong growth in market gardeners, small farms and agricultural markets, with the largest percentage increase (46%) in agricultural market growth in the country in 2011, compared to 17% nationally."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a supply gap elsewhere in the world, thus filling a niche in the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788," Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789," However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with Alaska's largest state fair in Palmer) take place mainly in late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"Fairs are primarily located in communities with historical or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers who exhibit products in addition to more publicized commercial activities such as carnival walks, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792," Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the major Bering Sea and North Pacific fisheries."
793,1,alaska,793,Seafood is one of the few foods that are often cheaper within the state than outside.
794,1,alaska,794," Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their domestic diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as for sport."
795,1,alaska,795," This includes fish caught by hook, net, or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Subsistence hunting, mainly caribou, moose and Dall's sheep, is still common in the state, particularly in the remote communities of Bush."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of traditional indigenous food is Akutaq, the Eskimo Ice Cream, which may consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798," Alaska reindeer farming is concentrated on the Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mixing and migrating with domestic reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799," Most food in Alaska is transported to the state from the outside, and shipping costs make food relatively expensive in cities."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, hunting and subsistence gathering are essential activities because imported food is prohibitive."
801,1,alaska,801," Although most of the small towns and villages in Alaska are along the coast, the cost of importing food into remote villages can be high, due to the terrain and difficult road conditions, which are changing considerably due to changes in climate and precipitation."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transportation can be up to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult periods, if these locations can be reached at all during these adverse weather conditions and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering an American gallon of milk (3.8 L) is approximately $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"The cost of fuel per gallon is consistently twenty to thirty cents above the contiguous U.S. average, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805, Alaska has few road links compared to the rest of the United States
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road network covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centres and the Alaska Highway, the main exit route from the state across Canada."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a motor ferry; this has led for decades to the debate about moving the capital to a city on the road network, or the construction of a road link from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,The western part of Alaska does not have a road network linking the communities to the rest of Alaska.
809,1,alaska,809,The interstate highways in Alaska comprise a total of 1082 miles.
810,1,alaska,810,"One of the unique features of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an Alaskan railway tunnel in operation recently renovated to provide an asphalt road link with the isolated community of Whittier, on Prince William Strait, to Seward Road, approximately 80 kilometres southeast of Anchorage, Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 4.0 km, the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812,The tunnel is North America's longest road and rail tunnel.
813,1,alaska,813," Built around 1915, the Alaskan Railway (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska until the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It connects North Pacific navigation by providing critical infrastructure with routes from Seward to the interior of Alaska through south-central Alaska, through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and the North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815," Cities, villages and the area served by the ARR are known throughout the State as ""The Railway Belt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the continuous improvement of the asphalt road network has begun to overshadow the importance of the railway to the Alaskan economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railway played a key role in Alaska's development, moving freight to Alaska while transporting natural resources south, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy at Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,It is well known for its summer tourism service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaskan Railway was one of the last railways in North America to use caboos in regular service and still use them on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last flag stopping roads in the country.
821,1,alaska,821,A section of about 100 km of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road
822,1,alaska,822," Until the construction of the park road in the 1970s, the railway provided the only land access to most of the area along its entire route."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northeastern Alaska, White Pass and the Yukon Highway also partly cross the state from Skagway north to Canada (British Columbia and Yukon), crossing the border at the White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824," This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise ship to Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was featured in the 1983 BBC TV series Great Little Railways.
826,1,alaska,826,The Alaska Railway network is not externally connected.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The closest link to the North American rail system is the northwestern terminus of Canada's National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska and Canada, and the 48 less."
829,1,alaska,829, Some private companies provide a float service between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830," Many towns and villages in the State do not have access to the road or highway; the only modes of access are air, river or sea travel."
831,1,alaska,831," Alaska's well-developed ferry network (known as the Alaska Highway) serves the cities of the southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832, Ferries carry vehicles as well as passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The network also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington, and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada, through the inland passage to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important maritime link for many communities on Southeast Prince of Wales Island and works with Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summer tourism market, primarily linking northwestern Pacific to southeastern Alaska and, to a lesser extent, the cities along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska."
836,1,alaska,836,"The population of Ketchikan, for example, fluctuates considerably for many days – up to four large cruise ships can moor there at the same time."
837,1,alaska,837," Cities not served by road, sea or river can only be reached by air, foot, dog sled or snow machine, which represents Alaska's highly developed bush air services – a novelty of Alaska."
838,1,alaska,838,"L'Anchorage and, to a lesser extent, Fairbanks, are served by many major airlines."
839,1,alaska,839," Due to limited access to roads, air transport remains the most efficient means of transport within and outside the State."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed numerous renovation and construction works at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to accommodate the rise of tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska welcomed almost two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841," Regular flights to most commercially viable villages and towns in the state are difficult to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government as part of the essential air services program."
842,1,alaska,842," Alaska Airlines is the only major airline to offer jet flights in the state (sometimes in combination with Boeing 737-400 cargo and passengers) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional centres such as Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak and other large communities, as well as to major communities in the southeast and the Alaska Peninsula."
843,1,alaska,843," Most of the remaining commercial flights originate from small regional suburban companies such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"Smaller towns and villages have to rely on regular or chartered bush services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845," Much of this service can be attributed to Alaska's mail bypass program, which subsidizes bulk delivery of mail to rural Alaskan communities."
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires that 70% of this subsidy be provided to carriers providing passenger transportation services to communities.
847,1,alaska,847, Many communities have small air taxis.
848,1,alaska,848, These operations are the result of demand for personalized transportation to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849, Perhaps the most quintessence plane in Alaska is the bush seaplane.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights to remote villages without airstrips carry passengers, freight and many items from stores and warehouse clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,"In 2006, Alaska had the largest number of per capita pilots in all U.S. states."
852,1,alaska,852, Another method of transportation in Alaska is the dog sled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (i.e. at any time after the mid-1920s), dog mushing is more a sport than a means of transportation."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are organised around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod sled dog race, a trail of 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum race in Nome in which moshers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicines very necessary to the diphtheria community of Nome when all the other means of transport failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from around the world come to Anchorage every March to fight for money, prizes and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that follows more precisely the route of the famous 1925 relay, starting from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) in Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by off-road vehicle and winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as is commonly referred to in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859,The Internet and other data transport systems in Alaska are largely provided by the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and, at the end of 2011, Alaska Communications announced that it has ""two fibre optic channels down 48 and two more across Alaska."
861,1,alaska,861,"In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was planned, partly supported by $350 million in federal government incentives."
862,1,alaska,862," Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive power composed of the Governor of Alaska and his appointed persons who are head of executive departments; a legislative power composed of the House of Representatives of Alaska and Senators of Alaska; and a judicial power composed of the Supreme Court of Alaska and lower courts."
863,1,alaska,863,"The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people throughout the state."
864,1,alaska,864,The Alaska Legislative Assembly is composed of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senator.

2523,5,colorado,2523,"In contrast to most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado."
2524,5,colorado,2524," Most of Colorado consists of mountains, foothills, high plains and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,The surrounding mountains and valleys significantly affect the local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a rule, with an increase in altitude comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeastern, eastern and southeastern Colorado are mainly the high plains, while northern Colorado is a mixture of high plains, foothills and mountains."
2528,5,colorado,2528,"Northwestern and western Colorado are mostly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed."

2531,5,colorado,2531,"The region is known for its abundant sun and cool and light nights, which gives this region a large range of average daytime temperature."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable because the heat dissipates in the space during the clear nights, since thermal radiation is not trapped by the clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, home to most of Colorado's population, is in a shade of precipitation due to its presence on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this zone may have several days above 95°F (35°C) and often 100°F (38°C)."
2535,5,colorado,2535,"In the plains, winter lows typically range from 25 to -10°F (−4 to -23°C)."
2536,5,colorado,2536," Approximately 75% of precipitation occurs during the growing season, from April to September, but this region is highly drought-prone."
2537,5,colorado,2537," Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from severe snowstorms that occur in winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538," Otherwise, winters tend to be usually dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,"In much of the region, the month of March is the most snowy month."
2540,5,colorado,2540,"April and May are usually the wettest months, while April is the wettest month in total."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"The cities of Front Range closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in winter due to Chinook winds that warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70°F (21°C) or higher in winter."
2542,5,colorado,2542,The average July temperature is 55°F (13°C) in the morning and 90°F (32°C) in the afternoon.
2543,5,colorado,2543,"The mean January temperature is 18 °F (−8 °C) in the morning and 48 °F (9 °C) in the afternoon, although the variation between consecutive days may be 40 °F (20 °C)."
2544,5,colorado,2544," Just west of the plains and in the foothills, there are a wide variety of climatic types."
2545,5,colorado,2545, Locations within a few kilometres of distance can experience a completely different time depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546," Most valleys have a semi-arid climate that is no different from the eastern plains, which moves to an alpine climate at the highest altitudes."
2547,5,colorado,2547,"Microclimates also exist in local areas that cover almost the full spectrum of climates, including subtropical highlands (Cfb/Cwb), wet subtropicals (Cfa), wet continentals (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterraneans (Csa/Csb) and subarctics (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548," Extreme climate change is common in Colorado, although a significant portion of extreme climate change occurs in the less populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549," Storms are common east of the continental ditch in the spring and summer, but are usually short."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"Hail is a common view in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern plains, especially the northeastern part of the state."
2551,5,colorado,2551,"Hail is the most commonly reported serious weather hazard for the warm season, and occasionally causes human injuries as well as significant damage to property."
2552,5,colorado,2552,The Eastern Plains are subject to some of the largest hailstorms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553," Examples include the violent hailstorms that struck Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the most costly in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The eastern plains are part of the extreme west of the Tornado gangway; some of the harmful tornadoes on the eastern plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town in 2008."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern plains see particularly frequent tornadoes, whether from mesocyclones in storms of supercells or less intense lands, such as in the Denver convergence vorticity zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,The plains are also exposed to occasional flooding and particularly severe flash floods caused by both thunderstorms and the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather.
2557,5,colorado,2557,"Notable examples include the Denver flood in 1965, the Big Thompson flood in 1976, and the Colorado flood in 2013."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common during the summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's 1901 record for consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken in the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days exceeded the previous record of almost a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561," Much of Colorado is very dry, with the average condition of only 17 inches (430 millimetres) of precipitation per year at the state level."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely experiences a time when a part is not in a certain degree of drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563," Lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of forest fires in the state, such as the Hayman fire in 2002."
2564,5,colorado,2564," Other notable fires include the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, the Waldo Canyon Fire, and the June 2012 High Park Fire, and the June 2013 Black Forest Fire."
2565,5,colorado,2565," Even these fires were overtaken by the pine mulch fire, the Cameron Peak fire, and the Eastern Troublefire in 2020, all of the largest fires in Colorado history (see Colorado Forest Fires in 2020)."
2566,5,colorado,2566," However, some mountainous areas of Colorado receive a high amount of moisture from winter snowfall."

3389,7,delaware,3389,"In general, those who did not move out of Delaware's state were baptized, became Christians and were regrouped with others of colour in official documents and in the minds of their non-Aboriginal American neighbours."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the current Delaware in the Middle Region by establishing a trading post in Zwaanendael, near the Lewes site in 1631."

3395,7,delaware,3395," Nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr, under the leadership of James, the Duke of York."
3396,7,delaware,3396," Combating an earlier claim of Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, owner of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat doubtful property to William Penn in 1682."
3397,7,delaware,3397,"Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his province of Pennsylvania and praised what was then known as the Duke's ""Delaware Low Counties""."
3398,7,delaware,3398,Penn established a representative government and briefly combined its two possessions under a single General Assembly in 1682.
3399,7,delaware,3399," However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had become so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the consent of the lower counties, and the two groups of representatives began to meet alone, one in Philadelphia, and the other in New Castle."
3400,7,delaware,3400,Penn and his heirs remained the owners of both and have always appointed the same person as governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory in the lower counties.
3401,7,delaware,3401,The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor wasn't unique.
3402,7,delaware,3402," From 1703 to 1738, New York and New Jersey shared a governor."
3403,7,delaware,3403, Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for a period of time.
3404,7,delaware,3404," Depending in the early years of contract work, Delaware imported more slaves while the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England."
3405,7,delaware,3405,"The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a commercial culture, although English immigrants continued to arrive."
3406,7,delaware,3406," Like the other middle colonies, the lower counties of Delaware first showed little enthusiasm for a breakup with Britain."
3407,7,delaware,3407," Citizens had good relations with the landlord government, and they were generally granted more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies."
3408,7,delaware,3408,The merchants at Wilmington harbour had commercial relations with the British.
3409,7,delaware,3409,"For example, New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and John Dickinson, from Kent County, became the ""Penman of the Revolution."""
3410,7,delaware,3410,"Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, Patriotic leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separate from British domination and Pennsylvania on 15 June 1776."
3411,7,delaware,3411,"The person who best represents the majority of Delaware, George Read, was unable to vote for a declaration of independence."
3412,7,delaware,3412, Only César Rodney's spectacular night trip gave the delegation the necessary votes to launch Delaware's vote for independence.

3415,7,delaware,3415,"The only real commitment to Delaware was the Battle of the Cooch Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777 at the Cooch Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a small Loyalist rebellion in 1778."
3416,7,delaware,3416," After the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British and State President John McKinly was taken prisoner."
3417,7,delaware,3417,"The British retained control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting trade and encouraging an active part of the Loyalist population, particularly in Sussex County."
3418,7,delaware,3418," Because the British promised the rebel slaves the freedom to fight with them, the escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines."
3419,7,delaware,3419," After the American Revolution, Delaware statesmen were among the main supporters of a strong United States centre with equal representation for each state."
3420,7,delaware,3420," Many colonialist settlers come from Maryland and Virginia to Delaware, where the population is growing rapidly."
3421,7,delaware,3421,The economies of these colonies were mainly based on labour-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves due to a decline in working-class immigrants from England.
3422,7,delaware,3422," Most English settlers had arrived as contract servants (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between the servant and the slave was fluid."
3423,7,delaware,3423, Most Afro-American families free from Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land.
3424,7,delaware,3424," They were mainly the result of relations or marriages between white maids and free African or African American slaves, servants or men."
3425,7,delaware,3425," Under the Slavery Act, children took on the social status of their mothers, so that children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, as were children born to slave women."
3426,7,delaware,3426,"As the flow of workers detached to the colony decreased with the improvement of economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and caste lines hardened."
3427,7,delaware,3427,"At the end of the colonial period, the number of people enslaved to Delaware began to decline."
3428,7,delaware,3428," Changes in the agricultural economy, from tobacco to mixed agriculture, have reduced the need for slave labour."
3429,7,delaware,3429,"In addition, local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaves to free their slaves after the American Revolution, and many did so in an explosion of individual manufacturers for idealistic reasons."
3430,7,delaware,3430,"In 1810, three-quarters of Delaware Blacks were free."
3431,7,delaware,3431," When John Dickinson released his slaves in 1777, he was the largest slave owner of Delaware with 37 slaves."
3432,7,delaware,3432,"In 1860, the largest slave holder owned 16 slaves."
3433,7,delaware,3433," Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practice the State had for the most part put an end to this practice."
3434,7,delaware,3434,"In the 1860 census, on the brink of civil war, 91.7% of the black population was free; 1,798 were slaves, compared with 19,829 ""free people""."
3435,7,delaware,3435,"In 1813, a slave freed Peter Spencer, the Church of the Union of Africans, chartered an independent black denomination."
3436,7,delaware,3436," This followed the establishment in 1793 in Philadelphia of the African Methodist Episcopal Church by Richard Allen, who had links with the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816."
3437,7,delaware,3437, Spencer built a church at Wilmington for the new confession.
3438,7,delaware,3438," This was renamed the African Union as the first Protestant-coloured Methodist church and connection, more commonly known as A.U.M.P."
3439,7,delaware,3439,It's a church.

3442,7,delaware,3442," While most of the Delaware citizens who fought during the war served in state regiments, some served in companies on the Confederate side in the regiments of Maryland and Virginia."
3443,7,delaware,3443,The Delaware is remarkable because it is the only slave state from which no Confederate regiment or militia group has been assembled.
3444,7,delaware,3444,"The Delaware essentially released the few slaves who were still in servitude shortly after the civil war but rejected the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution; the 13th amendment was rejected on 8 February 1865; the 14th amendment was rejected on 8 February 1867; and the 15th amendment was rejected on 18 March 1869."

3447,7,delaware,3447,The history of Delaware as a border state has led him to have characteristics of the northern and southern parts of the United States.
3448,7,delaware,3448,"In general, the rural areas of the South (or ""Slow Lower Lower"") of Delaware below the Chesapeake Canal and Delaware embody a southern culture, while the densely populated Northern Delaware above the canal — particularly Wilmington, part of Philadelphia's metropolitan area — is more in common with that of the Northeast."
3449,7,delaware,3449,"The U.S. Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the states of the South Atlantic, but is generally associated with the States of the Middle Atlantic and/or the Northeast of the United States by other federal agencies, the media and some residents."

4269,9,georgia,4269,"In 1870, following the reconstruction era, Georgia became the last Confederate State to be re-established in the Union."
4270,9,georgia,4270,"As the White Democrats regained power in the state's legislature, they voted for an election tax in 1877, which deprived many black and white poor people of registration."
4271,9,georgia,4271,"In 1908, the state established a white primary; with the help of the Democratic Party alone, it was another way of excluding blacks from politics."
4272,9,georgia,4272," They represented 46.7 per cent of the population of the State in 1900, but the proportion of the population of Georgia that was African-American subsequently fell to 28 per cent, mainly due to tens of thousands of people who left the State during the Great Migration."
4273,9,georgia,4273," According to the 2015 report of the Equal Justice Institute on lynching in the United States (1877-1950), Georgia killed 531 people, the second highest total of extrajudicial executions in any state in the South."
4274,9,georgia,4274,The overwhelming number of casualties was black and male.
4275,9,georgia,4275, Political exclusion persisted in the mid-1960s until the passage by Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
4276,9,georgia,4276,"A Baptist minister born in Atlanta who was part of the educated middle class that had developed in the African-American community of Atlanta, Martin Luther King Jr., appeared as a national leader in the civil rights movement."

4278,9,georgia,4278,"On 5 February 1958, during a training mission led by a B-47, a Mark 15 nuclear bomb, also known as the Tybee bomb, was lost off Tybee Island near Savannah."

4280,9,georgia,4280,"In the 1960s, the proportion of African-Americans in Georgia had fallen to 28 per cent of the population of the state, following waves of migration to the north and part of white immigration."

4287,9,georgia,4287,"In 1980, the construction of Atlanta Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport (ATL) was completed."
4288,9,georgia,4288,"The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than 100 million passengers per year."
4289,9,georgia,4289,"The airport, which employs more than 60,000 people, has become a major engine of economic growth."
4290,9,georgia,4290," With the benefits of cheap real estate, low taxes, the right to work and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, Atlanta's metropolitan area has become a national centre for finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, logistics and transportation, as well as film, convention and trade fair companies."
4291,9,georgia,4291,"In 1990, the International Olympic Committee chose Atlanta as the venue for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games."

4294,9,georgia,4294," From the Atlantic Ocean, the eastern border of the state with South Carolina goes up the Savannah River from the northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Senatorca rivers."
4295,9,georgia,4295,"It then continues to the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and to the Chattooga River, its largest tributary."
4296,9,georgia,4296, These limits were decided in the Treaty of Beaufort of 1797 and tested by the Supreme Court of the United States in the two Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989.
4297,9,georgia,4297,"The boundary then rotates strongly around the end of Rabun County, at 35° north latitude, although from this point it diverges slightly southward (due to inaccuracies in the initial survey)."
4298,9,georgia,4298," This northern border was originally the border of Georgia and North Carolina to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies encouraged the Georgian legislature to pass a law, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell most of Georgia's territory, which currently includes Alabama and Mississippi."
4299,9,georgia,4299,The western boundary of the state extends straight south-southeast from a point southwest of Chattanooga to the Chattahoochee River near West Point.
4300,9,georgia,4300,"It continues downwards to the point where it joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming the Apalachicola River of Florida); the south border goes almost full east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the St. Mary's River, which then forms the rest of the border back to the ocean."
4301,9,georgia,4301,The water limits are always fixed to be the original thalweg of the rivers.
4302,9,georgia,4302," Since then, several lakes have been flooded by dams, including Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint under Seminole Lake."
4303,9,georgia,4303," Georgian legislators have claimed that, during a study in 1818, the state border with Tennessee was wrongly placed a mile (1.6 km) further south than expected, and they continue to challenge it."
4304,9,georgia,4304,The correction of this impreciseness would give Georgia access to the water of the Tennessee River.
4305,9,georgia,4305, Each region has its own unique characteristics.
4306,9,georgia,4306,"For example, the ridge and valley, located in the northwest corner of the state, include limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which produced building limestone, barite, ocher and small amounts of coal."
4307,9,georgia,4307, Georgia has about 250 species of trees and 58 protected plants.
4308,9,georgia,4308,"The native trees of Georgia include red cedar, a variety of pines, oaks, holly, cypresses, sweetgum, scaly and white hickory bark, and the Sabal palm."
4309,9,georgia,4309,"East Georgia is found in the biome of subtropical coniferous forests and coniferous species, with other evergreen broad-leaved species making up the majority of southern and coastal regions."
4310,9,georgia,4310,Yellow jasmine and mountain laurel are just a few of the flowering shrubs of the state.
4311,9,georgia,4311,White-tailed deer (Virginia) are in almost all counties.
4312,9,georgia,4312,The northern mocker bird and the brown thrasher are among the 160 species of birds that live in the state.
4313,9,georgia,4313,"Reptiles include diamond-backed, copper-headed, cotton-mouthed snakes and alligators; amphibians include salamanders, frogs, and toads."
4314,9,georgia,4314, There are about 79 reptile species and 63 amphibians living in Georgia.
4315,9,georgia,4315,"The most popular freshwater fish are trout, bream, bass and catfish, all but the latter are produced in state hatcheries for restocking."
4316,9,georgia,4316," Popular saltwater hunting fish include red drum, spotted square, plaice, and tarpon."
4317,9,georgia,4317," Porpoise, whales, shrimp, oysters and blue crabs can be found on the coast and off the coast of Georgia."
4318,9,georgia,4318,The majority of the state is essentially a humid subtropical climate.
4319,9,georgia,4319,"Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest heights."
4320,9,georgia,4320,"The entire state, including the mountains of North Georgia, receives moderate to heavy rainfall, ranging from 45 inches (1143 mm) in central Georgia to about 75 inches (1905 mm) around the northeastern part of the state."
4321,9,georgia,4321,"The extent to which the time of a given region of Georgia is subtropical depends on latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, and altitude."
4322,9,georgia,4322," This latter factor is felt mainly in mountainous areas in the northern part of the State, which are more distant from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level."
4323,9,georgia,4323,The hardiness zones of USDA plants for Georgia range from zone 6b (not colder than -5°F (−21°C)) in Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b (not colder than 15°F (−9°C)) along the Atlantic coast and the Florida border.
4324,9,georgia,4324,"The highest temperature ever recorded was 112°F (44.4°C) at Louisville on 24 July 1952, while the lowest was −17°F (−27.2°C) in northern Floyd County on 27 January 1940."
4325,9,georgia,4325," Georgia is one of the main states of the frequency of tornadoes, although they are rarely stronger than EF1."
4326,9,georgia,4326," Although tornadoes hit the city are very rare, an EF2 tornado hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings."
4327,9,georgia,4327," With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century."
4328,9,georgia,4328," Georgia is often hit by hurricanes that hit the Florida Panhandle, weaken on land and bring strong winds of tropical storms and heavy rains inside, a recent example being Hurricane Michael, as well as hurricanes that are approaching the Georgian coast, sweeping the coast on their way north without ever making a landfall."
4329,9,georgia,4329, Hurricane Matthew 2016 and Hurricane Dorian 2019 did just that.
4330,9,georgia,4330," Because of anthropogenic climate change, Georgia's climate is warming."
4331,9,georgia,4331," This situation is already causing major disturbances, for example, due to sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable than many other states because its land is sinking) and the warming will ensue."
4332,9,georgia,4332,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that in 2019, Georgia had 10,617,423 inhabitants, an increase of 97,948 over the previous year, and an increase of 929,770 (9.60%) since 2010."
4333,9,georgia,4333," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438,939 (849,414 births minus 410,475 deaths) and an increase from the net migration of 606,673 people to the State."
4334,9,georgia,4334,"Immigration has resulted in a net increase of 228,415 people, and internal migration has resulted in a net increase of 378,258 people."
4335,9,georgia,4335,"In 2010, the number of illegal immigrants living in Georgia more than doubled, reaching 480,000 between January 2000 and January 2009, according to a federal report."
4336,9,georgia,4336, This gave Georgia the largest percentage increase among the 10 states with the largest populations of illegal immigrants in those years.
4337,9,georgia,4337, Georgia has banned sanctuaries from cities.
4338,9,georgia,4338,"In 2009, there were 743,000 ex-combatants."
4339,9,georgia,4339," According to the 2010 United States census, Georgia had 9,687,653 inhabitants."
4340,9,georgia,4340,"In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 59.7% White (55.9% non-Hispanic whites), 30.5% Blacks or African Americans, 0.3% Alaska Native Americans, 3.2% Asians, 0.1% Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, 4.0% other races and 2.1% two or more races."
4341,9,georgia,4341, Hispanics and Latinos of all races represented 8.8% of the population.
4342,9,georgia,4342,"In 2011, 58.8 per cent of the Georgian population under 1 year of age were minorities (i.e. they had at least one non-Hispanic white parent) compared to other states such as California with 75.1 per cent, New York with 55.6 per cent and Texas with 69.8 per cent."
4343,9,georgia,4343,The main groups of European descent are:
4344,9,georgia,4344,"In the 1980 census, 1,584,303 Georgians claimed English ancestry out of a total population of 3,994,817, making it 40 per cent of the State and the largest ethnic group at the time."
4345,9,georgia,4345," Today, many of these same people claiming to be of ""American"" descent are actually of English origin, and some of them are of Scottish origin; however, their families have been living in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify themselves simply as having an ""American"" ancestry or do not actually know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346," Their ancestry dates mainly to the thirteen colonies of origin and, for this reason, many of them are now content to claim ""American"" ancestry, although they are mainly of English ancestry."
4347,9,georgia,4347,"In 2004, 7.7 per cent of the Georgian population was under the age of 5, 26.4 per cent under the age of 18 and 9.6 per cent over the age of 65."
4348,9,georgia,4348,"In addition, in 2004, women accounted for about 50.6 per cent of the population and African Americans for about 29.6 per cent."
4349,9,georgia,4349," Historically, about half of the Georgian population was American Africans who, before the civil war, were almost exclusively slaves."
4350,9,georgia,4350,The Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of black people from rural south to industrial north from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African-American population.
4351,9,georgia,4351," Georgia experienced the second fastest growth of the Asian population in the United States from 1990 to 2000, more than double its size over the ten-year period."
4352,9,georgia,4352,"In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percentage of the total population that is African-American (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and the third in terms of the black digital population after New York and Florida."
4353,9,georgia,4353, Georgia is the third country with the lowest percentage of older persons (65 years and over) at 12.8 per cent (in 2015).
4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonization of a large number of Scottish, English-American and Scottish-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmonts, and the coastal colonization by some English-American and Afro-Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported into coastal areas in the 18th century on several occasions in rice-growing areas of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the Lower Country among African Americans.
4356,9,georgia,4356," They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture continue more than in other fields."
4357,9,georgia,4357,"In the creolisation of the culture of the South, their food routes have become an integral part of all the cuisine of the South in the Lower Country."
4358,9,georgia,4358,"In 2010, 87.35 per cent (7,666,663) of Georgians aged 5 and over spoke English at home as their primary language, while 7.42 per cent (651,583) spoke Spanish, 0.51 per cent (44,702) Korean, 0.44 per cent (38,244) Vietnamese, 0.42 per cent (36,679) French, 0.38 per cent (33,009) Chinese (including Mandarin) and German, which was spoken as their main language by 0.29 per cent (23,351) of the population aged 5 and over."
4359,9,georgia,4359,"In total, 12.65% (1 109,888) of the Georgian population aged 5 and over speak a mother tongue other than English."
4360,9,georgia,4360," Atlanta, located in north central Georgia to the Eastern Continental Division, has been the capital of Georgia since 1868."
4361,9,georgia,4361,"It is the most populated city of Georgia, with an estimated population of just over 506,000 in 2019."
4362,9,georgia,4362,"The metropolitan area of Atlanta is the cultural and economic center of South East; its estimated population in 2019 was more than 6 million, or 57% of Georgia's total."
4363,9,georgia,4363, Atlanta is the ninth metropolitan area in the country.
4364,9,georgia,4364,"The state has 17 cities with a population of more than 50,000, according to estimates from the 2019 U.S. Census."
4365,9,georgia,4365," Together with the rest of the South-East, the Georgian population continues to grow rapidly, with primary earnings concentrated in urban areas."
4366,9,georgia,4366,"The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area increased by 1.23 million people (24%) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta moved from the eleventh largest metropolitan area in the United States to the ninth largest."
4367,9,georgia,4367,"In Georgia, religious affiliation consists of 70 per cent Protestants, 9 per cent Catholics, 1 per cent Mormons, 1 per cent Jews, 0.5 per cent Muslims, 0.5 per cent Buddhists and 0.5 per cent Hindus."
4368,9,georgia,4368,"Atheists, deists, agnostics and other non-affiliated individuals make up 13% of the population."
4369,9,georgia,4369,"The largest Christian denominations according to the number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,759,317; the Methodist Church united with 619,394; and the Roman Catholic Church with 596,384."
4370,9,georgia,4370,"Non-denominational evangelical Protestants had 566,782 members; the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) had 175,184 members; and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. had 172,982."
4371,9,georgia,4371,"The Presbyterian Church (USA) is the largest Presbyterian body in the state, with 300 congregations and 100,000 members."
4372,9,georgia,4372,"The other large body, the Presbyterian Church in America, had 14 congregations and 2,800 members at its founding date; in 2010, it had 139 congregations and 32,000 members."
4373,9,georgia,4373,"The Roman Catholic church is remarkable in the urban areas of Georgia, and includes the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of Savannah."
4374,9,georgia,4374," Georgia is home to the largest Hindu temple in the United States, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Atlanta, located on the outskirts of Lilburn."
4375,9,georgia,4375," Georgia is home to several historical synagogues including the Temple (Atlanta), the Beth Jacob Congregation (Atlanta) and the Mickve Israel Congregation (Savannah)."
4376,9,georgia,4376,Shabad and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute are also active in the state.
4377,9,georgia,4377," Like all other U.S. states and the federal government, the Georgian government is based on the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial branches."
4378,9,georgia,4378,"The executive power of the state belongs to the governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republic)."
4379,9,georgia,4379,The Governor of Georgia and the Lieutenant Governor are elected by separate ballot for a four-year term.
4380,9,georgia,4380," Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. states, most of the executive officials who make up the governor's cabinet are elected by Georgian citizens rather than by the governor."
4381,9,georgia,4381,"The legislative power is vested in the General Assembly, composed of the Senator and the House of Representatives."
4382,9,georgia,4382,"The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker."
4383,9,georgia,4383,"The Constitution of Georgia provides for a maximum of 56 senators, elected in one-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives distributed among representative districts (which sometimes translates into more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives."
4384,9,georgia,4384,The term of office of Senators and Representatives is two years.
4385,9,georgia,4385, Laws promulgated by the General Assembly are codified in the annotated Official Code of Georgia.
4386,9,georgia,4386,"The State's judicial authority is vested in the State Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, which have State-wide jurisdiction."
4387,9,georgia,4387,"In addition, there are smaller courts with more limited geographical jurisdiction, including higher courts, state courts, juvenile courts, courts of first instance and probation courts."
4388,9,georgia,4388,The judges of the Supreme Court and the judges of the Court of Appeal are elected on a state-wide basis by citizens in non-partisan elections for a six-year term.
4389,9,georgia,4389,The judges of smaller courts are elected for a four-year term by the citizens of the State who fall within the jurisdiction of that court.
4390,9,georgia,4390," Georgia is made up of 159 counties, after Texas, with 254."
4391,9,georgia,4391," Georgia had 161 counties until the end of 1931, when Milton and Campbell were merged into the existing Fulton."
4392,9,georgia,4392," Some counties have been nominated for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, and many have names of Native American origin."
4393,9,georgia,4393,"The counties of Georgia have their own elected legislative power, usually known as the Council of Commissioners, which generally also has executive power in the county."
4394,9,georgia,4394," Several counties have a single form of Commissioner's government, with legislative and executive powers vested in a single person."
4395,9,georgia,4395, Georgia is the only state that currently has counties of Sole Commissioner.
4396,9,georgia,4396,"The Constitution of Georgia confers upon all counties and cities the authority of ""the State of residence""."
4397,9,georgia,4397,"County commissions have considerable power to pass laws within their county, as a municipality would."
4398,9,georgia,4398," Georgia recognizes that all local government units are cities, so that every incorporated city is legally a city."
4399,9,georgia,4399," Georgia does not provide for cantons or independent cities, although draft laws have been proposed to the Legislative Assembly to provide cantons; it authorizes consolidated county governments by local referendum."
4400,9,georgia,4400,"All the second-class cities of Georgia, with the exception of Savannah, have now formed by referendum the governments of consolidated counties: Columbus (in 1970), Athens (1990), Augusta (1995) and Macon (2012)."
4401,9,georgia,4401,(Augusta and Athens excluded one or more small towns within their consolidated borders; Columbus and Macon finally absorbed all small entities within their consolidated borders.)
4402,9,georgia,4402,The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated city-county government after merging with the unincorporated County of Chattahoochee in 2003.
4403,9,georgia,4403," Three years later, in 2006, the City of Georgetown merged with the rest of Quitman County."
4404,9,georgia,4404," There is no true metropolitan government in Georgia, although the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and the Georgia Regional Transport Administration provide some services, and the CRA must approve all major land use planning projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area."
4405,9,georgia,4405," Georgia voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a series that was broken when the state went for democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020."
4406,9,georgia,4406," Until 1964, the Georgian state government had the longest record of domination of a single party by the Democratic Party of any state of the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407, This record was largely established due to the exclusion of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws at the beginning of the 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408," Some elements, such as the obligation to pay taxes and pass literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted in the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century."
4409,9,georgia,4409,"White Democrats regained power after the reconstruction partly because of the intimidation and violence of some, but this method fell into disrepute."
4410,9,georgia,4410,"In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a constitutional amendment in 1908, Blacks made up 47 per cent of the population of the state."
4411,9,georgia,4411,"Whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice deprived blacks and poor whites, almost half the population of the state."
4412,9,georgia,4412,"It required that any man at least 21 years of age wishing to vote: (a) be of good moral character and be able to pass a citizenship test, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the constitutions of the United States and Georgia, or (c) possess at least 40 acres of land or $500 of property."
4413,9,georgia,4413,All Georgians who had fought in any war of the American Revolution during the Spanish-American War were exempt from these additional qualifications.
4414,9,georgia,4414," Most importantly, any Georgian descendant of a veteran of one of those wars was also exempt."
4415,9,georgia,4415," Because in 1908 many white men in Georgia were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only whites to vote well."

4426,9,georgia,4426,New white residents have arrived through migration and immigration.
4427,9,georgia,4427," Following the support of the National Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and in particular the civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia."

4435,9,georgia,4435,"In 1976 and 1980, the native son Jimmy Carter carried the state; in 1992, the former governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, narrowly won the state."
4436,9,georgia,4436,"In general, Republicans are the strongest in the predominantly white suburbs (especially the suburbs of Atlanta) and rural areas of the state."
4437,9,georgia,4437, Many of these regions were represented by conservative democrats in the state legislature long before the 21st century.

4441,9,georgia,4441,"The rise of the Republican Party in Georgia and the South in general led to the election of Newt Gingrich, a member of the House of Representatives of the United States as Speaker of the House following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994."
4442,9,georgia,4442,"Gingrich served as President until 1999, when he resigned as a result of the loss of seats in the House held by members of the GOP."
4443,9,georgia,4443,"Gingrich put forward a unsuccessful presidential candidacy in the 2012 elections, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries."

4445,9,georgia,4445, Chambliss did not obtain the necessary 50 percent of the votes due to a candidate from the Libertarian Party who obtained the rest of the votes.
4446,9,georgia,4446,"In the second round of elections held on 2 December 2008, Chambliss became Georgia's second Republican to be re-elected to the US Senate."
4447,9,georgia,4447,"In the 2018 election, the governor remained Republican (by 54,723 votes against a black democratic woman, Stacey Abrams), the Republicans lost eight seats in the House of Representatives of Georgia (gaining 106), while the Democrats won ten (gaining 74), the Republicans lost two seats in the Senate of Georgia (gaining 35 seats), while the Democrats won two seats (gaining 21) and five American Democrats."

4450,9,georgia,4450," This trend has led the state to elect Democratic Joe Biden as President in 2020, and it has just been considered a swing state."
4451,9,georgia,4451," During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made important changes to civil rights and governance."
4452,9,georgia,4452,"As in many other states, his parliament had not reassigned Congressional districts according to the population from 1931 to after the 1960 census."
4453,9,georgia,4453," Problems of misdistribution within the state legislature, where rural districts had higher power than urban districts, such as Atlanta, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964)."
4454,9,georgia,4454,The Court held that the districts of Congress had to be reassigned in order to have an essentially equal population.
4455,9,georgia,4455,"In a related case, Reynolds v. Sims (1964), state legislatures were to terminate the use of geographical districts or counties in favour of ""a man, a voice""; i.e. districts based on roughly equal populations, to be reviewed and amended as necessary after each census."
4456,9,georgia,4456, These changes have led residents of Atlanta and other urban areas to acquire political power in Georgia in proportion to their population.

4474,9,georgia,4474," Before 2020, the Republicans of the state, the federal and Congress had seen the margin of victory decrease, and many electoral forecasts had classified Georgia as a ""toss-up"" state or with Biden as a very narrow favourite."

4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of the discovery and human habitation of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743," Some archaeologists and historians believe that it is a subsequent wave of immigrants from Tahiti around the year 1000 that introduced a new line of high leaders, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the construction of heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744, This later immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (mo-olelo) about Pa-ao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745, Other authors argue that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence of a subsequent influx of Tahitian settlers and that Paao must be considered a myth.

4748,10,hawaii,4748,"The ancient Hawaii was a caste-based society, much like that of Hindus in India."
4749,10,hawaii,4749,"The arrival of the British explorer, Captain James Cook, in 1778 marked the first documented contact of a European explorer with Hawaii."
4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the Archipelago ""Sandwich Islands"" in honour of his godfather John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the location of the islands and making the native name Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form ""Owyhee"" or ""Owhyhee"" is preserved on behalf of certain locations in the U.S. Northwest Pacific, including Owyhee County and the Owyhee Mountains at Idaho, named after three Hawaiian Aboriginal members of a trap group that have disappeared in the area."
4752,10,hawaii,4752,"It is very possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the sixteenth century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778."
4753,10,hawaii,4753,"Ruy López de Villalobos ordered a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano on board as a pilot."

4755,10,hawaii,4755," If the crew of Villalobos spotted Hawaii, Gaetano would be considered the first European to see the islands."

4760,10,hawaii,4760,"For two and a half centuries, Spanish gallions crossed the Pacific from Mexico along a road that crossed the south of Hawaii on their way to Manila."
4761,10,hawaii,4761,The exact route has been kept secret to protect the Spanish commercial monopoly from competing powers.
4762,10,hawaii,4762," Hawaii thus maintained its independence, although it was located on an east-west sea route between the nations that were the subjects of the vice-royalty of New Spain, an empire that exercised jurisdiction over many civilizations and subject kingdoms on both sides of the Pacific."
4763,10,hawaii,4763," Despite these disputed claims, Cook is generally regarded as the first European to land in Hawaii, having visited the Hawaiian Islands twice."
4764,10,hawaii,4764,"As he was preparing for the start after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as Cook took the temple idols and fences as ""firewood"", and a minor chief and his men stole a boat from his ship."
4765,10,hawaii,4765,"Cook abducted the King of Hawaii, Kalaniōpuyu, and held him for ransom on board his ship in order to obtain the return of Cook's ship, as this tactic had previously worked in Tahiti and other islands."
4766,10,hawaii,4766," Instead, Kalanioupuou's sympathizers attacked, killing Cook and four sailors as Cook's party withdrew along the beach to their ship."
4767,10,hawaii,4767,The boat left without picking up the stolen boat.
4768,10,hawaii,4768," After Cook's visit and the publication of several books on his travels, the Hawaiian Islands attracted many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers, who found the islands as a convenient port and a source of supply."
4769,10,hawaii,4769,"The beginnings of British influence can be seen in the design of the Hawaiian flag, which carries the Union Jack in the upper left corner."
4770,10,hawaii,4770," These visitors introduced diseases into the islands that were once isolated, causing a rapid decline in the Hawaiian population."
4771,10,hawaii,4771," Native Hawaiians had no resistance to Eurasian diseases, such as influenza, smallpox and measles."
4772,10,hawaii,4772,"In 1820, disease, famine, and wars between chiefs killed more than half of the indigenous Hawaiian population."

4779,10,hawaii,4779," After Kamehameha II inherited the throne in 1819, American Protestant missionaries in Hawaii converted many Hawaiians to Christianity."
4780,10,hawaii,4780, They have used their influence to put an end to many traditional practices of the people.

4792,10,hawaii,4792,"In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1887."
4793,10,hawaii,4793," Prepared by businessmen and white lawyers, the document deprived the king of much of his authority."
4794,10,hawaii,4794,He established a property qualification for the vote that effectively prevented most Hawaiians and immigrant workers and favoured the richer and whiter elite.
4795,10,hawaii,4795," Resident Whites were allowed to vote, but resident Asians were not."

4812,10,hawaii,4812,"In 1993, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution of apology for the overthrow; it was signed by President Bill Clinton."
4813,10,hawaii,4813,"The resolution apologized and stated that the overthrow was illegal in the following sentence: ""The Congress, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on 17 January 1893, recognizes the historic significance of this event, which led to the suppression of the inherent sovereignty of the indigenous Hawaiian people""."
4814,10,hawaii,4814,"The apology resolution also ""recognizes that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii has taken place with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further recognizes that the Hawaiian indigenous people have never given up directly to the United States of America its inherent sovereignty as a people over its national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum."""

4825,10,hawaii,4825," Plantation owners and capitalists, who have maintained control through financial institutions such as the Big Five, have found the territorial status practical because they have remained able to import cheap foreign labour."

5197,11,idaho,5197,"It officially became American territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho territory was only organized in 1863, instead of being included for periods in the Oregon and Washington territories."

5209,11,idaho,5209,The origin of the name is a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the U.S. Congress planned to organize a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician who presented himself as an unrecognized delegate of the unofficial territory of Jefferson."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a Shoshone term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""the name of the mountains,"" but it was later revealed that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he was inspired to give the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"As the name seemed to be made, the U.S. Congress finally decided to appoint Colorado territory instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time that decision was made, the city of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been named according to Willing's proposal."
5213,11,idaho,5213,"In the same year, Congress established Colorado Territory, a county called Idaho County, in eastern Washington."
5214,11,idaho,5214,"The county was named after a steamship named Idaho, which was launched on the Columbia River in 1860."
5215,11,idaho,5215,It is not known whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was disclosed.
5216,11,idaho,5216,"In any event, part of Washington's territory, including Idaho County, was used to create Idaho's territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217," Finally, the name was given to the Idaho territory, which later became the American state."
5218,11,idaho,5218," Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well in the 20th century repeated as Willing's narrative the name ""Idaho"" derived from the term Shoshone ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,A history manual of Idaho 1956 says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"An alternative to etymology attributes the name to the Plains Apache word ""ídaahęγ"" IPA: [í.ta=.h=""] (enemy) which was used with reference to the Comanche."

5237,11,idaho,5237,"The plain served as an easy passage through the Rocky Mountains for settlers westbound on the Oregon Trail, and many settlers chose to settle in the area rather than risk the perfidious road through the Blue Mountains and the Cascade Range to the west."

5252,11,idaho,5252," This influence has a moderate effect in winter, where temperatures are not as low as might be expected in a northern state where altitudes are mostly high."
5253,11,idaho,5253," Maritime influence is less important in the eastern part of the state where rainfall is often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid continental climate."
5254,11,idaho,5254,"Idaho can be warm, although prolonged periods over 98°F (37°C) are rare, with the exception of the lowest point of altitude, Lewiston, who sees little snow as a result."
5255,11,idaho,5255,"The warm summer days are tempered by low relative humidity and cooler evenings during the summer months since, for most states, the greatest diurnal temperature difference is often in summer."

5259,11,idaho,5259," Excavations at the Wilson Butte Cave near Twin Falls in 1959 revealed signs of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest artifacts dated in North America."
5260,11,idaho,5260,American Indians who predominated in the area included the Perce Nose in the north and the Shoshone in the north and west in the south.
5261,11,idaho,5261,A late upper paleolithic site was identified at Cooper's Ferry in western Idaho near the town of Cottonwood by archaeologists in 2019.
5262,11,idaho,5262," According to the evidence found at the site, the first people lived in the area 15,300 to 16,600 years ago, before the Beringia Land Bridge of about 1,000 years old."
5263,11,idaho,5263,"The discoverers, anthropology professor Loren Davis and his colleagues, pointed out that they have similarities with the tools and artifacts discovered in Japan 16,000 to 13,000 years ago."
5264,11,idaho,5264,"The discovery also showed that the first peoples might not have come to North America by land, as has already been said."
5265,11,idaho,5265,"On the contrary, they probably went through the water on a Pacific coastal road."
5266,11,idaho,5266,"An early presence of French Canadian trappers is visible in the names and toponyms: Nose Percé, Coeur d'Alène, Boisé, Payette, some pre-existing expeditions of Lewis and Clark and Astorian who themselves included a large number of French and Métis guides recruited for their knowledge of the terrain."
5267,11,idaho,5267,"The Idaho, part of Oregon, was claimed by the United States and Britain until the United States acquired its undisputed jurisdiction in 1846."
5268,11,idaho,5268," From 1843 to 1849, the Idaho was de facto under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon."
5269,11,idaho,5269," When Oregon became a state, what is now Idaho was in what remained of the original Oregon territory not part of the new state, and designated as Washington territory."
5270,11,idaho,5270," Between that date and the creation of the territory of Idaho on 4 March 1863, at Lewiston, parts of the present state were included in the territories of Oregon, Washington and Dakota."
5271,11,idaho,5271,"The new territory included today's Idaho, Montana and most of Wyoming."
5272,11,idaho,5272,"The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the Pacific Road and in 1806 on the return, largely following both directions of the Clearwater River."
5273,11,idaho,5273,"The first non-Aboriginal settlement was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Pend Oreille Lake for the fur trade in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company."
5274,11,idaho,5274,"In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, then working for the Pacific Fur Company, established a position on the lower Clearwater River near Lewiston."
5275,11,idaho,5275," This position, known as ""MacKenzie's Post"" or ""Clearwater"", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was purchased by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned."
5276,11,idaho,5276,The first attempts by organized communities within Idaho's current borders were made in 1860.
5277,11,idaho,5277,The first permanent and incorporated community was Lewiston in 1861.
5278,11,idaho,5278," After a few tribulations as a territory, including the chaotic transfer from the territorial capital of Lewiston to Boise, the abandonment of the right to vote of the Mormonist polygamists supported by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, and a federal attempt to divide the territory between the territory of Washington which obtained state status in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho obtained state status in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,Idaho was one of the hardest hit by Pacific Northwest States during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280," Prices fell for Idaho's main crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes raised only ten cents from $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho's farmers saw their annual income fall from $686 in 1929 to $250 in 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a state of tourism and agriculture to include the scientific and technological industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest economic centre in the state (more than 25 per cent of total government revenues) and are more important than agriculture, forestry and mining."
5283,11,idaho,5283,"The U.S. Census Office estimates that the Idaho population was 1,787,065 on July 1, 2018, an increase of 14% since 2010."
5284,11,idaho,5284,"The Idaho population was estimated at 1,754,208 in 2018, an increase of 37,265 over the previous year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010."
5285,11,idaho,5285," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to the net migration of 75,795 people in the state."
5286,11,idaho,5286, There are a large number of Americans of English and German descent in Idaho.
5287,11,idaho,5287,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and migration within the country resulted in a net increase of 61,273 people."
5288,11,idaho,5288," This made Idaho the tenth fastest growing state after the District of Columbia (+16.74%), Utah (+14.37%), Texas (+14.14%), Florida (+13.29%), Colorado (+13.25%), North Dakota (+13.11%), Nevada (+12.36%), Arizona (+12.20%) and Washington."
5289,11,idaho,5289," From 2017 to 2018, Idaho was the second fastest, surpassed only by Nevada."
5290,11,idaho,5290,"Nampa, approximately 30 km west of downtown Boise, became the second largest city in the state in the late 1990s, passing through Pocatello and Idaho Falls."
5291,11,idaho,5291,"The population of Nampa was less than 29,000 in 1990 and increased to over 81,000 in 2010."
5292,11,idaho,5292," Located between Nampa and Boise, Meridian also experienced strong growth, from less than 10,000 residents in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now the third largest city in Idaho."
5293,11,idaho,5293," Growth of 5% or more over the same period was also observed in Caldwell, Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls and Twin Falls."
5294,11,idaho,5294," Between 1990 and 2010, the population of Idaho increased by more than 560,000 (55%)."

5296,11,idaho,5296," Other metropolitan areas in size order are Heart of Alene, Idaho Falls, Pocatello and Lewiston."
5297,11,idaho,5297,The table below shows the racial composition of the Idaho population in 2016.
5298,11,idaho,5298," According to the 2017 U.S. Community Survey, 12.2% of the Idaho population were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (10.6%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.1%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (1.3%)."
5299,11,idaho,5299,"The five main groups of ancestry were German (17.5%), English (16.4%), Irish (9.3%), American (8.1%) and Scots (3.2%)."
5300,11,idaho,5300,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, resulting in a higher overall number."
5301,11,idaho,5301," According to the Pew Research Center on Religion & Public Life, the self-identified religious affiliations of Idahoans over 18 years of age in 2008 and 2014 were:"
5302,11,idaho,5302," According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest denominations according to the number of members in 2010 were the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Days Saints with 409 265; the Catholic Church with 123 400; the Evangelical Protestant with 62 637; and the Assemblies of God with 22,183."

5307,11,idaho,5307,"The three varieties of wheat, dark north spring, hard red, and soft white are grown in the state."
5308,11,idaho,5308,The County of Nez Perce is considered to be the first place with soft white growth.
5309,11,idaho,5309,"Idaho's major industries are food processing, lumber and wood products, machinery, chemicals, paper products, electronic manufacturing, silver and other extractive industries, and tourism."
5310,11,idaho,5310,"The largest factory in the world for cask cheese, the raw product for processed cheese is in Gooding, Idaho."

5314,11,idaho,5314,The Idaho also houses three facilities in Anheuser-Busch that provide much of the malt to brewers across the country.
5315,11,idaho,5315,A variety of industries are important.
5316,11,idaho,5316," Outdoor recreation is a common example, ranging from many snowmobile, downhill and cross-country ski resorts in winter to Lewiston's evolution as a retreat community based on mild winters, a dry, year-round climate and one of the lowest mid-wind speeds everywhere, combined with rivers for a wide variety of activities."
5317,11,idaho,5317," Other examples would be the ATK Corporation, which operates three ammunition and ammunition components plants in Lewiston."

5323,11,idaho,5323," Today, the largest industry in Idaho is the science and technology sector."
5324,11,idaho,5324,It accounts for more than 25% of the state's revenues and more than 70% of the state's exports.
5325,11,idaho,5325,"The industrial economy of Idaho is growing, with high-tech products at the forefront."
5326,11,idaho,5326," Since the late 1970s, Boise has become a centre for semiconductor production."

5348,11,idaho,5348,"In 2017, Idaho's primary energy source was hydro, and energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatt hours (MWh)."
5349,11,idaho,5349,"In 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market, with the Idaho Utilities Commission regulating the three main utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,The energy landscape of Idaho supports the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,"The state is rich in renewable sources of energy, but its fossil fuel resources are limited."
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller watersheds provide Idaho with some of the country's best hydroelectric resources and geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind energy potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353, These realities have shaped much of the energy landscape of the state.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports the bulk of the energy it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355," Imports account for more than 80% of energy consumption, including the total supply of natural gas and oil to Idaho and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"In 2005, 48% of the electricity consumed in Idaho came from hydroelectricity, 42% from coal combustion and 9% from natural gas combustion."
5357,11,idaho,5357,The rest comes from other renewable sources such as wind power.
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The many river basins in the state allow hydropower plants to supply 556,000 MWh, representing about three quarters of the electricity generated by Idaho in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,The state of Washington supplies most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two main pipeline systems that supply the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360," Although the State relies on sources outside the State for its total supply of natural gas, it uses natural gas-fired facilities to produce 127,000 MWh, or about 10 per cent of its production."
5361,11,idaho,5361, Coal production and the small grid of state wind turbines provide the rest of the state's electricity production.
5362,11,idaho,5362,The State produces 739 000 MWh but still has to import half of its electricity from third countries to meet the demand.
5363,11,idaho,5363," While the 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) in Idaho are small compared to other states and account for only 0.5% of U.S. consumption, the state also has the country's 11th smallest population, 1.5 million people, so its energy consumption per capita of 352 million BTU (103 MWh) is just above the national average of 333 million BTU (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th state in terms of area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), distance creates the additional problem of ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365," When the length of an electric transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electrical current passing through it is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States and the population is expected to increase by 31% between 2008 and 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367," This projected population increase will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, which will increase Idaho's limited hydroelectric resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has a higher estimate of the development potential to generate 44 320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind energy and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar energy using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of photovoltaics on roofs, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar energy."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Ministry of Transport is the government agency responsible for Idaho's transportation infrastructure, including operations and maintenance and planning for future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of federal funding, state funding and subsidies for government transportation programs."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is one of the few states of the nation without a major highway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise to the south and Coeur d'Alene to the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"US-95 links the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it desperately needs repairs and improvements."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Department of Transport reported that the Government's road infrastructure was facing a deficit of $200 million per year in maintenance and improvement."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main road connecting the south-east and south-west parts of the State, with I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Major Federal Aid Routes in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"The main airports are the Boise International Airport serving the southwestern Idaho region and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) serving northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377, Other scheduled airports include Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving Palouse; Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport serving Lewis-Clark Valley and the north and west centre of Idaho; Magic Valley Regional Airport at Twin Falls; Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and Pocatello Regional Airport.
5378,11,idaho,5378,Idaho is served by three transcontinental railways.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects Idaho Panhandle to Seattle, Portland and Spokane to the west, and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"The BNSF crosses the counties of Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary."
5381,11,idaho,5381,"The Union Pacific Railway crosses the northern Idaho between Canada and Boundary and Bonner, heading towards Spokane."
5382,11,idaho,5382,"Canadian Pacific Railway uses the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in North Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon."
5383,11,idaho,5383,"The Amtrak Empire Builder crosses the northern Idaho, with its only stop at Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384," Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho."
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific railway also crosses southern Idaho between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,Lewiston Harbour is the furthest inland port of the Pacific on the west coast.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and the Columbia River facilitate the movement of barges from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded onto ocean vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,The constitution of Idaho is roughly modelled on the national constitution with several additions.
5389,11,idaho,5389,The Constitution defines the form and functions of the State government and can be modified through a plebiscite.
5390,11,idaho,5390,"In particular, the constitution of the State currently requires that the Government of the State maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391," Consequently, Idaho has a limited debt (construction bonds, etc.)."

5395,11,idaho,5395,The Idaho still works according to its original constitution (1889).
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The Constitution of Idaho provides for three powers of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected in 35 legislative districts, each represented by a senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398," Since 1946, State-wide constitutional officials have been elected for a four-year term."

5402,11,idaho,5402,The government of Idaho has a monopoly on alcohol.
5403,11,idaho,5403,The governor of Idaho has a four-year term and is elected in so-called national mid-term elections.
5404,11,idaho,5404,"As such, the Governor is not elected during the same election year as the President of the United States."
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current Governor is Republican Brad Little, who was elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,The Idaho Legislative Assembly is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407," However, the session can be extended if necessary, and it is often extended."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"For this reason, the legislators of Idaho are considered ""citizen legislators"", which means that their position as legislator is not their main profession."
5409,11,idaho,5409,The terms of office of the Senate and House of Representatives are two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410,A number of parliamentary elections are held each year.
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The Idaho Legislature has been permanently controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although democratic legislators are systematically elected from Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and North Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,Idaho's highest court is the Supreme Court of Idaho.
5413,11,idaho,5413," There is also an interim court of appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeal, which hears cases referred to it by the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The State District Courts are at the service of seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,Idaho is divided into political courts designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416," Since 1919, there have been 44 counties, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 square kilometres)."
5417,11,idaho,5417, Three counties were first designated as such by the Washington territorial legislature in 1861.
5418,11,idaho,5418,"Nez Percé County in 1861 has since been divided into counties of Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai and Clearwater."
5419,11,idaho,5419,The Idaho registration plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county name.

6386,13,indiana,6386,"Indiana also owns at least 900 million barrels of oil reserves in the Trenton field, although they are not easy to recover."
6387,13,indiana,6387," While Indiana has committed to increasing the use of renewable resources such as wind, hydro, biomass or solar energy, progress has been very slow, mainly due to the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana."

6397,13,indiana,6397,"No airlines operate from the Terre Haute regional airport, but it is used for private aircraft."

6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on non-systematic road names (e.g., Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott and Washington counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415, There are also counties in the northern parts of the State that have never set up a network or implemented only part of it.
6416,13,indiana,6416," Some counties are also distributed in a network that is almost similar to that of diamonds (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson and Knox counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417, Such a system is also almost useless in these situations as well.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"One day, Knox County used two different network systems for county roads because the county was developed using two different surveying systems, but it has since decided to use route names and to combine roads instead."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"In particular, the St. Joseph County road network, the main city of which is South Bend, uses perennial names (trees) (i.e., trees)."

6436,13,indiana,6436, Evansville has been the port of entry for the U.S. Customs for more than 125 years.
6437,13,indiana,6437,"For this reason, it is possible to have international shipments sent to Evansville on bail."
6438,13,indiana,6438,International freight can then clear customs at Evansville rather than a coastal port.
6439,13,indiana,6439,Indiana's constitution of 1816 was the first in the country to establish a publicly funded school system.
6440,13,indiana,6440,It also awarded a canton to a public university.

6521,14,iowa,6521, This transformation has gradually occurred.
6522,14,iowa,6522," During the archaic period (10,500-2,800 years ago), American Indians adapt to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increase."
6523,14,iowa,6523,"More than 3,000 years ago, at the end of the archaic period, the American Indians of Iowa began to use domesticated plants."
6524,14,iowa,6524,"In the following period, there was increased dependence on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics and specialized livelihoods."
6525,14,iowa,6525," During the late prehistoric period (from about 900 AD), increased use of corn and social changes led to flourishing and nucleated social institutions."

6533,14,iowa,6533," Spain exercised a very loose control over the Iowa region, granting trade licences to French and British traders, who established trading posts along the Mississippi and the Moines."
6534,14,iowa,6534,"Iowa was part of a territory known as Louisiana or Louisiana, and European traders were interested in lead and fur obtained by Aboriginal peoples."

6541,14,iowa,6541," Much of the Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805, but it was only after Fort Madison was built in 1808 that the United States established tenuous military control over the area."
6542,14,iowa,6542,"Fort Madison was built to control the trade and establish American domination over the Upper Mississippi, but it was misconceived and hostile by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom were allies with the British, who had not abandoned the claims on the territory."
6543,14,iowa,6543,"Fort Madison was defeated by the British-backed Natives in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby in the Prairie of the Dog in Wisconsin also fell into British hands."
6544,14,iowa,6544,Black Hawk participated in the siege of Fort Madison.
6545,14,iowa,6545, Another small military outpost was established along the Mississippi River in the present Bellevue.
6546,14,iowa,6546," This poorly located stockade was also attacked by hundreds of Aboriginal people in 1813, but was successfully defended and later abandoned until the settlers returned to the area in the mid-1830s."

6548,14,iowa,6548,The United States encouraged the colonization of the eastern part of Mississippi and the abduction of Indians to the west.
6549,14,iowa,6549,"A disputed treaty of 1804 between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison, which ceded much of Illinois to the United States, enraged many Sauk and led to the Black Hawk War of 1832."
6550,14,iowa,6550,"The Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley in 1832 in the purchase of Black Hawk and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of which settled in a reserve in Kansas."
6551,14,iowa,6551," Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the Meskwaki settlement remains to this day."
6552,14,iowa,6552,"In 1856, the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented law allowing Meskawki to buy land."
6553,14,iowa,6553," However, contrary to the unprecedented act of the Iowa Legislature, the United States federal government, through the use of treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk of Iowa in 1848 and the Dakota of Iowa in 1858."
6554,14,iowa,6554,The Western Iowa around Bluffs of the Modern Council was used as an Indian reserve for the members of the Council of Three Fires.
6555,14,iowa,6555,The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.
6556,14,iowa,6556,"Mainly, they were families from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia who settled along the western shores of Mississippi and founded the modern cities of Dubuque and Bellevue."

6560,14,iowa,6560,"On 28 December 1846, Iowa became the 29th State of the Union when President James K. Polk signed the Iowa Admission Bill."
6561,14,iowa,6561," Once admitted to the Union, the State's border problems solved, and most of its land purchased from indigenous people, Iowa gave its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the rich agricultural land of the young border state, good citizens, free and open society, and good government."
6562,14,iowa,6562,Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs.
6563,14,iowa,6563,The first and second fairs in the State of Iowa took place in the more developed eastern part of the State in Fairfield.
6564,14,iowa,6564,"The first fair took place on October 25 and 27, 1854, at a cost of approximately $323."
6565,14,iowa,6565," Subsequently, the fair moved to places closer to the centre of the state and, in 1886, found a permanent home in Des Moines."
6566,14,iowa,6566," Since then, the State Fair has been held every year, except for a few exceptions: 1898 due to the war between Spain and America and the World Fair held in Omaha, Nebraska, nearby; 1942 to 1945 due to the Second World War, because the fairs were used as a supply depot for the army; and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States."
6567,14,iowa,6567,"The Iowa supported the Union during the civil war, voting strongly for Abraham Lincoln, although there was an anti-war movement ""Copperhead"" in the state, caused in part by a fall in crop prices caused by the war."
6568,14,iowa,6568," There were no battles in the state, although the Battle of Athens, the Missouri, 1861, was fought just opposite the River Des Moines of Croton, the Iowa, and the fire of the battle landed in the Iowa."
6569,14,iowa,6569,The Iowa sent large reserves of food to the armies and eastern cities.

6572,14,iowa,6572,"Iowa contributed proportionally more men to the military service of the civil war than any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, more than a sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates went to Appomattox."
6573,14,iowa,6573, Most fought in the large countryside in the Mississippi Valley and in the south.
6574,14,iowa,6574,"Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri, Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge and Rossville Gap, and Vicksburg, Iuka and Corinth."

6580,14,iowa,6580," After the civil war, the population of Iowa continued to grow considerably, from 674,913 in 1860 to 1,624,615 in 1880."
6581,14,iowa,6581,The American Civil War briefly brought higher benefits.

7896,17,louisiana,7896,In 1682 French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle named the Louisiana region in honour of King Louis XIV of France.
7897,17,louisiana,7897,"The first permanent establishment, Fort Maurepas (now Ocean Springs, Mississippi, near Biloxi), was founded in 1699 by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, a French officer of Canada."
7898,17,louisiana,7898,"At the time, the French had also built a small fort at the mouth of Mississippi in an establishment they called La Balise (or La Balize), ""marque de mer"" in French."
7899,17,louisiana,7899,In 1721 they built here a 19-metre wooden lighthouse structure to guide ships on the river.
7900,17,louisiana,7900,A Royal Order of 1722 – following the Crown's transfer of the governance of Illinois country from Canada to Louisiana – may have provided the broadest definition of Louisiana: all the lands claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies.
7901,17,louisiana,7901,"A generation later, trade disputes between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745 the Governor General of Louisiana, Vaudreuil, fixed the northerly and easterly boundaries of his estate, such as the Wabash Valley, to the mouth of the Vermilion River (almost today Danville, Illinois); thence from the northwest to the Rock on the Illinois River, and thence westward to the mouth of the Rock River (now Rock Island, Illinois)."
7902,17,louisiana,7902,"For example, Vincennes and Peoria were the limits of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (high Wabash near Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (nearly today Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada."
7903,17,louisiana,7903,"The colony of Natchitoches (long of the Red River in the present northwest of Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent European colony in the modern state of Louisiana."
7904,17,louisiana,7904,"The French establishment had two objectives: to establish commercial exchanges with the Spaniards in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances in Louisiana."
7905,17,louisiana,7905,"The colony soon became a flourishing port and river junction, giving birth to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were exploited by imported African slaves."
7906,17,louisiana,7906,"In time, planters have developed large plantations and built beautiful houses in a growing city."
7907,17,louisiana,7907," This has become a repeated model in New Orleans and other places, although the cultivation of commodities in the south was mainly sugar cane."
7908,17,louisiana,7908,"The French colonies of Louisiana contributed to exploration and outposts, concentrated along the shores of Mississippi and its main tributaries, from Louisiana to the north of the area known as Illinois, around the present-day St. Louis, Missouri."
7909,17,louisiana,7909,The latter was established by the French colonists of Illinois.
7910,17,louisiana,7910,"At the beginning, Mobile then Biloxi was the capital of La Louisiana."
7911,17,louisiana,7911," Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River for trade and military interests, and wishing to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civil and military authority in the south of the Great Lakes."
7912,17,louisiana,7912," Since then, until the United States acquired the territory in Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and lands west of Mississippi."
7913,17,louisiana,7913,"In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi, in an area called the German coast."
7914,17,louisiana,7914,"France ceded most of its territory east of Mississippi in Great Britain in 1763, following Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War (generally called the French and Indian War in North America)."
7915,17,louisiana,7915,"The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, had become a colony of Spain by the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)."
7916,17,louisiana,7916,Power transfer on each side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.
7917,17,louisiana,7917,"In 1765, during Spanish domination, several thousand Francophone refugees from the Acadia region (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada) visited Louisiana after being expelled from their homeland by the British during the French and Indian War."
7918,17,louisiana,7918," They settled mainly in the southwestern region of Louisiana, now known as Acadiana."
7919,17,louisiana,7919," Governor Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, wishing to obtain more settlers, welcomed the Acadian refugees, ancestors of the Cajuns of Louisiana."
7920,17,louisiana,7920,"The Spanish Canary Islands, known as Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783."
7921,17,louisiana,7921,"In 1800, the Frenchman Napoleon Bonaparte took over Louisiana from Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years."
7922,17,louisiana,7922,"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, carrying them from a French colony in the West Indies."
7923,17,louisiana,7923,"In 1709 French financier Antoine Crozat obtained a trade monopoly in La Louisiana, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois."
7924,17,louisiana,7924,"""This concession allowed him to bring a cargo of African blacks every year,"" wrote British historian Hugh Thomas."
7925,17,louisiana,7925," Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh that there was high mortality among both settlers and slaves, resulting in continued demand for and import of slaves."
7926,17,louisiana,7926," From 1719, traders began importing more slaves; two French ships, Du Maine and Aurore, arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves from Africa."
7927,17,louisiana,7927, Louisiana's former slaves had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721 New Orleans had 1,256 inhabitants, approximately half of whom were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724, the French government published a law called the Black Code (""Black Code"" in English) which ""regulates the interaction of white [white] and black [black] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much greater than the present state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law included 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, prohibited ""interracial"" marriages (those between persons of different skin colour, whose varying nuances were also defined by law), restricted manipulation, described the legal penalties imposed on slaves for various offences, and defined certain obligations of owners towards their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main intention of the French government was to assert control of the system of slavery of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on the owners of slaves.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Black Code was extremely difficult to enforce by far."
7933,17,louisiana,7933," Some priests continued to perform interracial wedding ceremonies, for example, and some slave owners continued to handle slaves without permission, while others brutally punished slaves."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Black Code of 1724 requires owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the State religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935, Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves."
7937,17,louisiana,7937," During the economic crisis of the 1740s in the colony, the owners struggled to feed their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938," Giving them free time also gave more power to the slaves, who began to cultivate their own gardens and to make objects for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939," They began to participate in the economic development of the colony, while increasing their independence and self-subsistence."
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Black Code prohibits mixed marriages, prohibits mixed marriages, but hardly protects women slaves from the rape of their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941," Overall, the Code benefits owners but has more protections and flexibility than the establishment of slavery in the 13 southern colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 makes cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers are rarely prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"The fugitive slaves, called marons, could easily hide in the hinterland of the bayous and survive in small settlements."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maroon"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", that is, ""fugitive bovine""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"At the end of the eighteenth century, the last Spanish governor of Louisiana wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946," When the United States bought Louisiana in 1803, it was quickly accepted that African slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighbouring Mississippi, although it violated American law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947," Despite the demands of Rep. James Hillhouse of the United States and the brochure Thomas Paine to apply the federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the least expensive work."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small sugar producer with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Santo Domingo and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949," Shortly thereafter, he became an important sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations."
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, Louisiana's first governor of the United States, stated that the work of African slaves was necessary because white workers ""can't have in this unhealthy climate."""
7951,17,louisiana,7951," Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to implement the abolition of the slave trade in Africa, which the United States and Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including coastal trade, the shipping of slaves along the Atlantic coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"In 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the United States, making a major contribution to the economy of the city and the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,"New Orleans had become one of the richest cities, and the nation's third largest city."
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and the importation of slaves has increased demand in the internal market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"Over the decades since the American Revolutionary War, more than a million African slaves have been forced to migrate from the South to the South, two thirds of them in the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957, Others were transported by their owners as slave owners moved westward for new lands.
7958,17,louisiana,7958," With the shift in agriculture in the Upper South as planters moved from tobacco to low-labour-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had surplus workers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959, Many sold slaves to traders to take them to the deep south.
7960,17,louisiana,7960, Slaves were driven by Upper South merchants or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by boat as part of the slave trade.
7961,17,louisiana,7961," After sales to New Orleans, steamboats operating on Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations in Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,The Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted between 1769 and 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963," From the 1790s onwards, waves of immigration took place from Santo Domingo, following a slave rebellion that began in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana on the island, including ethnic Europeans, people of free colour and African slaves, some of whom were brought by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965," They significantly increased the Francophone population of New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and slaves strengthened African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The process of independence in Santo Domingo is complex, but the uprisings are continuing."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803, France withdrew its surviving troops from the island, after having suffered the loss of two thirds sent to the island two years earlier, mainly with yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic of the western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, carried out by slave leaders."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) said: ""Saint-Domingue is, of all our colonies in the West Indies, the one whose mentality and customs have most influenced Louisiana."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970," When the United States gained independence from Britain in 1783, one of its main concerns was to have a European power at its western border, and the need for unlimited access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachians were hindering the shipment of goods to the east."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship the products was to use a flat boat to float it in Ohio and Mississippi to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be placed on oceanic ships."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this route was that the Spaniards had both sides of Mississippi below Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974, Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana implied the creation of a new empire centered on the sugar trade in the Caribbean.
7975,17,louisiana,7975," Under the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain restored to the French the property of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe."
7976,17,louisiana,7976, Napoleon saw Louisiana as a deposit for these sugar islands and as a buffer for the American establishment.
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a great military force to take over Santo Domingo, then under the control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.When the army led by Napoleon Leclerc's brother-in-law was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish the French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979," With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close Mississippi to the American trade at any time."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, American minister in France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, parts of the east shore of Mississippi, and the free navigation of the river for American trade."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston has been allowed to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer from Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's treaty with the Spaniards was a poorly guarded secret at the border."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, the acting intendant of Louisiana, made public Spain's intention to revoke the right of deposit in New Orleans for all cargoes from the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port to the United States has caused anger and dismay.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,Trade in the West has been virtually blocked.
7986,17,louisiana,7986," Historians believe that the revocation of the deposit was caused by the abuses committed by the Americans, in particular by smuggling, and not by the French intrigues, as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987," President Jefferson ignored public pressure for the war with France, and appointed James Monroe as Special Envoy to Napoleon, to help secure New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson also increased the authorized expenditures to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989," However, on April 11, 1803 French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking him how willing the United States was to pay for the whole of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered it)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon could withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them without the possibility of obtaining the desired region of New Orleans), and that President Jefferson's approval could take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open the negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"As at 30 April, they entered into a transaction for the purchase of the entire territory of Louisiana of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for sixty million francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,"Part of this amount, $3.5 million, was used to cancel France's debts to the United States."
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in U.S. bonds, which Napoleon sold in nominal value to the Dutch company Hope and Company and to the British banking company of Baring, at a discount of $87 1⁄2 per unit of $100."
7994,17,louisiana,7994," Consequently, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"English banker Alexander Baring confided Marbois in Paris, fled to the United States to recover the bonds, took them to Great Britain and returned to France with the money Napoleon was waging war against his own country."
7996,17,louisiana,7996," When news of the purchase came to the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,He had authorized spending of $10 million for a port city and received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a set of lands that would double the size of the country.
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents in the federalist party argued that the purchase in Louisiana was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or the negotiation of treaties without the consent of the senator."
7999,17,louisiana,7999," What really worries the opposition is the new states that will inevitably be cut off from Louisiana territory, reinforcing Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England's federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000," President Jefferson was a strong supporter of westward expansion, and he was firm in his support of the treaty."
8001,17,louisiana,8001," Despite federalist objections, the U.S. senator ratified the Treaty of Louisiana on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002,"By law promulgated on 31 October 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories transferred by France and to ensure the initial governance."
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony took place in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004,"As the territory of Louisiana had never been officially handed over to the French, the Spaniards removed their flag and the French raised their flag."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,"The next day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans in the United States."
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony took place in Saint-Louis on 9 March 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The next day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the first United States of America"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,The artillery marched its troops into the city and ran the American flag on the mast of the fort.
8009,17,louisiana,8009," Louisiana's territory was officially transferred to the U.S. government, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010," Louisiana's territory, purchased for less than three hundred per acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without war or loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It paved the way for the expansion of the United States across the continent towards the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012," Shortly after the acquisition of possession by the United States, the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on March 26, 1804, thus organizing the territory of Orleans to the south and the district of Louisiana (later formed as the territory of Louisiana) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013, Louisiana became the eighteenth state of the United States on 30 April 1812; the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana and the territory of Louisiana simultaneously became the territory of Missouri.
8014,17,louisiana,8014,A region known as Florida Parishes was soon annexed to Louisiana on 14 April 1812.
8015,17,louisiana,8015," From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a two-party system, with the Democrats competing first with the Whigs, then with the Know Nothings, and finally with other Democrats."
8016,17,louisiana,8016," According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, or almost 47 per cent of the total population of the State (708,002)."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,The strong economic interest of the elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to separate from the Union on 26 January 1861.
8018,17,louisiana,8018,He followed other southern states in secession after Abraham Lincoln's election as President of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019, Louisiana's secession was announced on 26 January 1861 and was one of the Confederate States of America.
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated in the civil war, the result of the Union's strategy to cut Confederation into two by seizing Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,"The federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862."
8022,17,louisiana,8022," Since a large part of the population had sympathy from the Union (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the Federally-controlled Louisiana regions as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives in the American Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023," After the civil war and the emancipation of slaves, violence intensified in the South as war was waged by insurgent private and paramilitary groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024,"At first, state legislatures were dominated by former confederates, who adopted black codes to regulate free men and generally refused to vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025, They refused to grant the right to vote to African-Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).
8026,17,louisiana,8026," Following the Memphis riots in 1866 and the New Orleans riot that same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted which provided the vote and full citizenship for the liberated men."
8027,17,louisiana,8027," Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for states where conditions were considered to be the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,He was regrouped with Texas in what was administered as the fifth military district.
8029,17,louisiana,8029, African-Americans began to live as citizens with some equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030,"Freed men and persons of colour who had been free before the war began to make more progress in education, family stability and employment."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was huge social instability in the aftermath of the war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labour market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to impose white supremacy, first in Ku Klux Klan's chapters."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"In 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white democrats in Louisiana and other states regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which eliminated the black vote through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034," According to the example of Mississippi in 1890, in 1898, the white, democratic, planter-dominated legislature adopted a new constitution that effectively deprived people of colour of their rights, raising barriers to voter registration, such as voting taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect was immediate and sustainable.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896 there were 130,334 black voters on the lists of electors and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the population of the State, which was also divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"In 1900, the population of the State was 47% African-American, a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038," Many in New Orleans were descendants of coloured Creoles, the large population of colourless people before the civil war."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"In 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the State."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"In 1910, there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 per cent of eligible African American men), despite progress in education and literacy among blacks and people of colour."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve in juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"The White Democrats established a one-party democratic regime, which they maintained in the state for decades deep in the 20th century until, after the passage by Congress of the 1965 law on voting rights, federal control and the application of the constitutional right to vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African-Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration northward to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape from Jim Crow society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,Plow infestation and agricultural problems have cost many farmers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,Mechanization of agriculture has also reduced the need for workers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046," From the 1940s, Blacks went west to California for jobs in its expanding defence industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047," During part of the Great Depression, Louisiana was ruled by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected on a popular appeal.
8049,17,louisiana,8049," His public works projects have provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he has supported education and increased suffrage for the poor whites, but Long has been criticized for his supposedly democratic and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He extended control of patronage to all branches of the Louisiana government.
8051,17,louisiana,8051, His plans for the redistribution of wealth in the state are particularly controversial.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule came to an abrupt end when he was murdered in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,The mobilization for the Second World War created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,But thousands of other black and white workers have emigrated to California for better jobs in its booming defence industry.
8055,17,louisiana,8055," Many African-Americans left the state during the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s to the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had greatly reduced the need for workers.
8057,17,louisiana,8057," They were looking for qualified jobs in the defence industry in California, better education for their children, and living in communities where they could vote."
8058,17,louisiana,8058,"On 26 November 1958, at Chennault Air Force Base, a USAF B-47 nuclear-weapon bomber on board fired a fire on the ground."
8059,17,louisiana,8059,The wreckage of the aircraft and the site of the accident were contaminated after a limited explosion of non-nuclear materials.
8060,17,louisiana,8060,"In the 1950s, the state created new conditions for a citizenship test for the registration of voters."
8061,17,louisiana,8061," Despite opposition from the State Rights Party, low-state black voters have begun to increase their enrolment rates, which also reflects the growth of their middle class."
8062,17,louisiana,8062,"In 1960, the state established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation."
8063,17,louisiana,8063," Despite this, the registration and participation rate of black voters has gradually increased to 20 per cent or more, and it was 32 per cent in 1964, when the first national legislation on civil rights at the time was adopted."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"The percentage of black voters varied widely in those years, from 93.8% in the evangelical parish to 1.7% in the parish of Tensas, for example, where there were white efforts to suppress the vote in the parish with a black majority."
8065,17,louisiana,8065,"Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill cities were the catalysts for the creation of the first two chapters of the Deacons of Defence and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, respectively, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa."
8066,17,louisiana,8066,"Composed of veterans of the Second World War and the Korean War, they were armed self-defence groups established to protect activists and their families."
8067,17,louisiana,8067,"In 1965, following the adoption of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal government ordered the local police to protect the activists."
8068,17,louisiana,8068," Other chapters were formed in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama."
8069,17,louisiana,8069,"In 1960, the proportion of African-Americans in Louisiana fell to 32%."
8070,17,louisiana,8070,"The 1,039,207 black citizens are still subject to segregation and exclusion."
8071,17,louisiana,8071, African-Americans continue to face disproportionate discriminatory application of the state's rules on voter registration.
8072,17,louisiana,8072," Due to better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, Blacks continued to migrate out of Louisiana for a net loss of more than 37,000 people."
8073,17,louisiana,8073," According to official census figures, in 1970 the African-American population stood at 1,085,109 persons, a net gain of more than 46,000 persons compared to 1960."
8074,17,louisiana,8074," During this last period, some people began to migrate to New South cities to find opportunities."
8075,17,louisiana,8075," Since that time, blacks have entered the political system and have begun to be elected to power, as well as other possibilities."
8076,17,louisiana,8076,"On 21 May 1919, the nineteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, giving women the full right to vote, was adopted at the national level, and was enacted throughout the United States on 18 August 1920."
8077,17,louisiana,8077, Louisiana finally ratified the amendment on 11 June 1970.
8078,17,louisiana,8078," Because of its location on the Gulf coast, Louisiana has regularly suffered from the effects of tropical storms and harmful hurricanes."
8079,17,louisiana,8079,"On August 29, 2005, New Orleans and many other lower parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were affected by the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina."
8080,17,louisiana,8080,It caused many damage as a result of the breakup of dykes and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city.
8081,17,louisiana,8081," Officials have issued warnings to evacuate the city and surrounding areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, have remained behind, many of whom have remained blocked."
8082,17,louisiana,8082, Many people have died and survivors have suffered damage from widespread flooding.

8091,17,louisiana,8091, Louisiana entered the first phase of the reopening of the state on May 15.
8092,17,louisiana,8092,"On June 4, Governor John Bel Edwards signed an Order in Council that moved to the second phase."
8093,17,louisiana,8093, That's the government.
8094,17,louisiana,8094,"Edwards extended the second phase to September 11, and the third phase began with speculation on October 9."
8095,17,louisiana,8095, Louisiana is bordered west by Texas.
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The State can be properly divided into two parts, the northern highlands, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial area includes low marshlands, coastal marshes and beaches, as well as barrier islands that cover approximately 20,000 square miles (52,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098," This area is mainly along the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi, which crosses the state from north to south for a distance of approximately 600 mi (970 km) and flows into the Gulf of Mexico; the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The width of the alluvial region along Mississippi is 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100 km), and along the other rivers the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15 km) across."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as the dike), from which the land decreases to a river beyond an average fall of 6 feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,Alluvial lands along other watercourses have similar characteristics.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The highest and contiguous hills in the north and north-western parts of the state have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103, They are made up of meadows and forests.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,Altitudes above sea level range from 10 feet (3 m) on the coast and marshy lands to 50 to 60 feet (15 to 18 m) on grasslands and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the highlands and hills, elevations rise to Driskill Mountain, the highest point of the state at only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106," From 1932 to 2010, the State lost 1800 square miles due to sea level rise and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPAR) spends approximately $1 billion annually to assist in the establishment and protection of Louisiana shorelines and lands through federal and state funding.
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"In addition to the previously named rivers, there are the Sabine River, forming the western boundary; and the Pearl River, the eastern boundary; the Calcasieu River, the Mermentau River, the Vermilion River, Bayou Teche, the Atchafalaya River, the Boeuf River, Bayou Lafourche River, the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne River, the Macon River, the Tensas River, the Amite River, the Tchefuncte River, the Tickfaw River, the Natalbany River, and a number of other smaller rivers, constituting a natural network of navigable rivers, with a length of more than 4,000 miles (6,400 km)."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The State also has political jurisdiction over the portion of approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) of underwater land on the interior continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110," Thanks to a particular feature of the political geography of the United States, it is a territory far less than the 14 km wide jurisdiction of the neighbouring states of Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have vast Gulf coasts."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The south coast of Louisiana in the United States is one of the most disparate regions in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112, This is largely due to poor management of the coast by humans (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one point, the land was added as spring flooding of the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated the growth of the marshes; the land is now shrinking."
8114,17,louisiana,8114, There are many causes.
8115,17,louisiana,8115, Artificial dikes block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to the marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"The marshes have been extensively exploited, leaving canals and ditches that allow saltwater to move inland."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move seawater inwards, damaging marshes and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,The rise in seawater has exacerbated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119, Some researchers estimate that the state loses a mass of ground equivalent to 30 football fields a day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120," There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including the restoration of natural floods in Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121," Without this restoration, the coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as communities disappear, more and more people leave the area."
8123,17,louisiana,8123," Since coastal wetlands support economically important inshore fisheries, the loss of wetlands negatively affects this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,"The Gulf of Mexico ""dead zone"" off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States."
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"In 2017, it stood at 32,730 km2 and was the largest ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico did not exist 250 million years ago, whereas there was only one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As Pangea separates, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico open."
8128,17,louisiana,8128," Louisiana has slowly developed, over millions of years, from water to land and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,The oldest rocks are exposed in the north in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest.
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date back to the early Cenozoic era, 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,"The history of the formation of these rocks is found in the road geology of D. Spearing, Louisiana."
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest parts of the state have been formed over the past 12,000 years as successive deltas of the Mississippi River: the Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, the modern Mississippi, and now the Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133,The sediments were transported from north to south through the Mississippi River.
8134,17,louisiana,8134," Between the northern tertiary rocks and relatively new sediments along the coast, there is a large belt known as Terrasses du Pleistocene."
8135,17,louisiana,8135, Their age and distribution can be largely related to sea level rise and fall over past ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep canals, while the more recent terraces tend to be much more flattered."
8137,17,louisiana,8137, Salty domes are also found in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138," Their origin dates back to the early Gulf of Mexico, when the shallow ocean experienced high evaporation rates."
8139,17,louisiana,8139," There are several hundred salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140,The salt domes are important not only as a source of salt
8141,17,louisiana,8141," Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long summers, warm, humid and short, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, its low elongated topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its furthest point is not more than 200 mi (320 km)."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rain is common throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state wet season."
8144,17,louisiana,8144, There was a fall in precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, the storms are built during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief tropical rains."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In winter, rain is more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June to September with an average of 90°F (32°C) or higher, and night bass with an average of more than 70°F (21°C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148," Sometimes temperatures in the 1990s F, combined with dew points in the higher 70s F, create sensible temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The wet, thick heat, like the jungle in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies."
8150,17,louisiana,8150,"The temperatures are generally warm in winter in the southern part of the state, with peaks around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico on average 66°F (19°C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the condition is slightly cool in winter, with average heights of 59°F (15°C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152," Low nights in winter are on average well above freezing in the whole state, with 46°F (8°C) mean near the Gulf and 37°F (3°C) mean low in winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153," Occasionally, cold fronts from low-pressure centres to the north reach Louisiana in winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154," Low temperatures near 20°F (−7°C) sometimes occur in the northern part of the state, but rarely in the southern part of the state."
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although northern residents may receive snow dust a few times a decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"The highest recorded temperature in Louisiana is 114°F (46°C) at Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is −16°F (−27°C) at Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157," Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to major hurricane strikes, particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can cause damage to water through a vast area of major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The region is also subject to frequent storms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state has an average of more than 60 days of storms per year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161, Louisiana has an average of 27 tornadoes a year.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The entire State is vulnerable to a tornado, with the southern extreme of the State slightly less than the rest of the State."
8163,17,louisiana,8163," Tornadoes are more frequent from January to March in the southern part of the State, and from February to March in the northern part of the State."
8164,17,louisiana,8164," Due to its location and geology, the state has a great biodiversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165," Some vital areas, such as the southwestern Prairies, have suffered a loss of more than 98 per cent."
8166,17,louisiana,8166," Flat pines are also at great risk, mainly through fire suppression and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167, There is still no well-organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168," Such a system would consist of a protected system of central areas linked by biological corridors, as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169," Louisiana contains a number of areas which, to varying degrees, prevent people from using them."
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to the areas of the U.S. National Parks Service and a national forest, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, a state conservation area, a state forest, and many wildlife management areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of the largest public areas of Louisiana is the Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172," Its area is 600,000 acres, more than half of which are flat forests, which are home to many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173, These include the Louisiana Pine Snake and the red peacock peak.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The government-owned cypress marsh system around Pontchartrain Lake is another large area, with southern wetland species including scratches, alligators and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 base areas would be required to build a ""protected area system"" for the state; these would be southwestern grasslands, the Pearl River floodplain to the east, and alluvial marshes from the Mississippi River to the north."
8176,17,louisiana,8176," Historic or scenic areas managed, protected or otherwise recognized by the National Parks Service include:"
8177,17,louisiana,8177," Louisiana operates a network of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and a state preservation area."
8178,17,louisiana,8178," Louisiana has 955,973 acres in four ecoregions under wildlife management in Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries."
8179,17,louisiana,8179,Nature Conservation also owns and manages a range of natural areas.
8180,17,louisiana,8180,"The Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System provides some degree of protection to 51 rivers, streams and bayous in the state."
8181,17,louisiana,8181,It is administered by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
8182,17,louisiana,8182," Louisiana has 308 incorporated municipalities consisting of four consolidated parish cities and 304 cities, towns and villages."
8183,17,louisiana,8183," Louisiana's municipalities cover only 7.9% of the state's surface area, but account for 45.3% of its population."

8273,17,louisiana,8273, Louisiana's economy and policy of the last half century cannot be understood without taking full account of the influence of the oil and gas industries.
8274,17,louisiana,8274,"For example, in the 1970s, over 40% of Louisiana's public revenues came directly from start-up taxes and mining royalties."
8275,17,louisiana,8275," Since the 1980s, the headquarters of these industries has been consolidated in Houston, but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the Gulf of Mexico's crude oil and gas industry remain in Louisiana."

8278,17,louisiana,8278," Louisiana is home to many, especially notable are the culture distinct from the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of colour, descendants of mixed families free from colonial periods and early state."
8279,17,louisiana,8279,The French colony of La Louisiana struggled for decades to survive.
8280,17,louisiana,8280,"The conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops known to settlers, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281, Imported colonists and slaves had high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"Settlers continued to import slaves, resulting in a high proportion of West Africans who continued to practice their culture in new environments."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As the historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall described, they developed an Afro-Creole culture marked in the colonial era."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a significant influx of white and Métis refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285," This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in Santo Domingo came from Africa than from the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286," They have strongly influenced the city's Afro-American culture in terms of dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is a grouping of French, African, Spanish (and other European) and Amerindian cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word crioulo; originally, it referred to a colonist of European origin (especially French) born in the New World, compared to immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289," Louisiana's earliest manuscript to use the word ""Creole"" of 1782 applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,But originally he referred more generally to French settlers born in Louisiana.
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, a relatively large group of Colour Creoles (free coloured people) developed in the French colony, mainly descended from African slaves and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mixture, as well as some Native Americans)."
8292,17,louisiana,8292," Often, the French free their concubines and their Métis children, and pass on social capital to them."
8293,17,louisiana,8293,"For example, they could educate sons in France and help them enter the French army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294, They also installed property or capital on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295, Colourless people gained more rights in the colony and sometimes in education
8296,17,louisiana,8296, Many have become craftsmen and owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""creole"" has become associated with this class of coloured creoles, many of which gained freedom well before the civil war."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,The rich French Creoles generally maintained townhouses in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside the city along the Mississippi River.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans has the largest population of colour free people in the region; they can find work and create their own culture, marrying each other for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"Cajuns' ancestors migrated mainly from western central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally known as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301," After the British defeat of France in the French and Indian War (seven-year war) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of Mississippi to Great Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated the families and expelled them from Acadia because they refused to devote fidelity to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304," Some, who escaped from the British, remained in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305," Others have been dispersed in France, Canada, Mexico or the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306, Many Acadian refugees settled in southern Louisiana in the region around Lafayette and the country of LaFourche Bayou.
8307,17,louisiana,8307," They developed a separate rural culture, different from the French Creole settlers of New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"By marrying others in the area, they developed what was known as music, cooking and Cajun culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309," Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered to be somewhat derogating."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of l'Isleños.
8311,17,louisiana,8311," Its members were descendants of settlers from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and married other communities such as the French, Acadians, Creoles, Spaniards and other groups, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, the Isleños originally settled in four communities, including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313," Among these colonies, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were most successful, with the other two suffering from diseases and floods."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language in the 21st century.
8315,17,louisiana,8315," That being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs completely stopped in Saint Bernard with those who have competence in Spanish being octagenary."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Over the centuries, the different communities of Isleño de Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canaries heritage while adopting and relying on the customs and traditions of the communities around them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317," Today, two heritage partners exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard and the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana."
8318,17,louisiana,8318,"The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated annually in the parish of St. Bernard, which presents heritage representations of local groups and the Canary Islands."
8319,17,louisiana,8319," According to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among people aged five and over, 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% French (standard French, Creole French or French cajun), 3.30% Spanish and 0.59% Vietnamese."
8320,17,louisiana,8320," Historically, the Amerindian peoples of the region at the time of the European meeting were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321," Among these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have live native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322," Other Amerindian peoples have migrated to the region, escaping from Eastern European pressure."
8323,17,louisiana,8323," Among them were the people of Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati and Ofo."
8324,17,louisiana,8324, From the 1700s French settlers began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans.
8325,17,louisiana,8325, They established French cultural and linguistic institutions.
8326,17,louisiana,8326," They imported thousands of slaves from West African tribes, who spoke several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the process of Creolization, the slaves developed a Creole dialect of Louisiana incorporating both French and African forms, which the colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were people of mixed race, in particular, who spoke Creole French from Louisiana."
8329,17,louisiana,8329," During the 19th century after the purchase of Louisiana by the United States, English gradually became more important for business and government due to the evolution of the population with the establishment by many Americans who were English-speaking."
8330,17,louisiana,8330, Many ethnic Francophone families continue to use French privately.
8331,17,louisiana,8331, Slaves and some free-coloured people also spoke Louisiana's Creole French.
8332,17,louisiana,8332,"The Constitution of the State of 1812 gives an official status to English in judicial proceedings, but the use of French remains widespread."
8333,17,louisiana,8333,The subsequent constitutions of the states reflect the decreasing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The Constitution of 1868, adopted at the time of the reconstruction before the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, prohibits laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335," Subsequently, the French legal status was somewhat restored, but it never regained its importance before the civil war."
8336,17,louisiana,8336," Several unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana."
8337,17,louisiana,8337,The dialects of the French language are: French colonial and French houma.
8338,17,louisiana,8338, Louisiana Créole French is the term of one of the Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339," Two unique dialects developed from the English language: Louisiana English, a variety of English with French influence in which the fall of /r/postvocalism is common; and what is informally called Yat, which resembles the dialect of New York City sometimes with southern influences, especially that of historic Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340," These two accents were influenced by large Irish and Italian immigrant communities, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341, Colonial French was the dominant language of the white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period.
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, Métis people and slaves developed Louisiana Creole, with a base in West African languages."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish domination at the end of the 18th century did not result in the widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"The French Creole and Louisiana are still used in modern Louisiana, often in family gatherings."
8345,17,louisiana,8345,"English and its associated dialects became predominant after the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, after which the region became dominated by many Anglophones."
8346,17,louisiana,8346,"In some regions, English is influenced by French, as we have seen with Louisiana's English."
8347,17,louisiana,8347," Colonial French, although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, persisted alongside English."
8348,17,louisiana,8348,"The renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the creation of Canadian-style French immersion schools, as well as bilingual signage in the French historic neighbourhoods of New Orleans and Lafayette."
8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the State has maintained the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which promotes the use of the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and the international relations of the State."

8891,19,maryland,8891,"In 1644 William Claiborne, a Puritan, seized Kent Island while his partner, pro-Parliamentary Puritan Richard Ingle, took possession of St. Mary's."
8892,19,maryland,8892, Both used religion as a tool to obtain popular support.
8893,19,maryland,8893,"The two years from 1644 to 1646, when Claiborne and his partners in Puritan held Sway were known as ""The Plundering Time""."

8914,19,maryland,8914,A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682 was undermined by the fact that Penn received the additional grant of what is today Delaware.

8970,19,maryland,8970,"In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked on standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by parties); obtained closed polling stations to prevent party workers from assisting voters; launched primary elections to prevent party bosses from selecting candidates; and registered candidates without party symbols, which discouraged illiterates from participating."
8971,19,maryland,8971, These measures targeted the poorly educated whites and blacks.
8972,19,maryland,8972,"Blacks have resisted such efforts, with voting groups leading the education of voters.The Blacks have defeated three efforts to deprive them of their right to vote, making alliances with immigrants to resist various democratic campaigns."

8989,19,maryland,8989," Beginning in the 1960s, while suburban growth began around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to adopt a more mid-Atlantic culture, contrary to the traditional southern and tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state."

8998,19,maryland,8998,"In an effort to reverse the depopulation caused by the loss of workers' industries, Baltimore launched urban renewal projects in the 1960s with Charles Center and the Baltimore World Trade Center."
8999,19,maryland,8999," Some have resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighbourhoods, resulting in social volatility, and some older residential neighbourhoods around the harbour have had renovated units and become popular with new populations."
9000,19,maryland,9000,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Maryland's population was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 4.71% since the 2010 U.S. Census and 2,962 over the previous year."

9006,19,maryland,9006,"In 2011, 58.0% of the population of Maryland under 1 year of age were from minorities."
9007,19,maryland,9007,"Note: Births in the table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, resulting in a higher overall number."

10741,23,mississippi,10741,"The Mississippi is home to 63 crayfish species, including at least 17 endemic species."
10742,23,mississippi,10742, Mississippi is home to eight species of winter pebbles.
10743,23,mississippi,10743," Due to seasonal flooding, possible from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile flood plain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744,"The flood of the river created natural dikes, which the planters had built earlier to try to avoid flooding of cultivated land for cotton crops."
10745,23,mississippi,10745, Temporary workers built dykes along the Mississippi River over the natural dykes that formed from land deposited after the flood of the river.
10746,23,mississippi,10746," From 1858 to 1861 the State assumed responsibility for the construction of dykes, carrying it out through contractors and labour hires."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to be hired for such a dangerous job."
10748,23,mississippi,10748, Entrepreneurs have hired Irish immigrant gangs to build dykes and sometimes open land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749, Many Irish were relatively recent immigrants of years of famine who struggled to settle.
10750,23,mississippi,10750," Prior to the U.S. Civil War, the average height of the dykes was six feet, although in some areas they reached twenty feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751," Floods have been an integral part of Mississippi's history, but clearing land for cultivation and supply of wood for steamboats has removed the absorption of trees and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river were stripped naked, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753," After the civil war, large floods ravaged the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754," Such floods regularly submerged the dikes damaged by the Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those built after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties."
10756,23,mississippi,10756,"In 1879, the United States Congress established the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included assisting state dykes in the construction of dykes."
10757,23,mississippi,10757,"In the late 19th century, white and black temporary workers were hired to build the dams."
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"In 1882 the dikes averaged seven feet in height, but many in the southern delta were severely affected by the flooding that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759," After the flood of 1882, the system of dykes was extended."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the district of Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee was created to oversee the construction and maintenance of dykes in the northern delta counties, including some Arkansas counties that were part of the delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761," Floods submerged the northwest of Mississippi in 1912-13, causing heavy damage to the dyke districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,The regional losses and lobbying of the Mississippi River Levee Association for a flood control bill contributed to the passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide matching federal funds for local dyke districts on a scale of 2:1.
10763,23,mississippi,10763," Although U.S. participation in the First World War interrupted the financing of the dikes, the second funding cycle helped raise the average height of the dikes in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764, Scientists now understand that dykes have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow rate of the river and reducing the area of floodplains.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The area was severely damaged as a result of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which pierced the dykes."
10766,23,mississippi,10766," There have been losses of millions of dollars in goods, stocks and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The greatest damage occurred in the lower delta, including the counties of Washington and Bolivar."
10768,23,mississippi,10768," Although scientific knowledge of Mississippi has increased, upstream development and the consequences of dams have caused more severe flooding in recent years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769, Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and the construction of dikes have changed the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770," This work eliminated the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, thereby strengthening the flow of the river."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The federal and state governments are fighting for the best approaches to restoring certain natural habitats in order to better interact with the original river ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772," Nearly 10,000 Native Americans or Paleo-Indians from British Columbia have arrived in what is now called the South American."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,The southern Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers who continued the megafauna that died after the end of the Pleistocene era.
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Amerindian colonies and agricultural fields were developed on natural dikes, higher in the vicinity of rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Amerindians have developed large fields near their permanent villages.
10776,23,mississippi,10776," Along with other practices, they created localized deforestation, but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777," After thousands of years, the subsequent cultures of the timber and Mississippi eras have developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which the surplus has supported the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778, Both were mound building crops.
10779,23,mississippi,10779," Those in Mississippi culture were the largest and most complex, built from about 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,"People had a commercial network covering the continent, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf coast."
10781,23,mississippi,10781," Their large terraces, expressing their cosmology of political and religious concepts, are still in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys."
10782,23,mississippi,10782,The Amerindian tribes of the descendants of Mississippi culture in the southeast include Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783," Other tribes that lived in Mississippi (and whose names were honoured by settlers in local towns) include Natchez, Yazoo and Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who crossed the northeastern part of the state in 1540, during his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French settlers established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built near current ocean sources on the Gulf coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was established by Pierre Le Moyne of Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,"In 1716, the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (under the name of Fort Rosalie), becoming the dominant city and trading post of the region."
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the largest territory ""New France""; the Spaniards continued to claim part of the Gulf Coast region (east of Mobile Bay) of the present-day southern Alabama, in addition to the entire current Florida region."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"In the 18th century, the region was ruled by various Spanish, French and British colonial governments."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,The colonists imported African slaves as workers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791," Under the French and Spanish rule, there has been the development of a class of people free of colour (people of free colour), mainly multiracial descendants of European men and black women slaves or free, and their Métis children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,"At first, French and Spanish settlers were mainly men."
10793,23,mississippi,10793," While more and more European women have joined the colonies, men have race unions among women of African descent (and increasingly of multiracial ancestry), both before and after the marriage of European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"European men often help their multiracial children to educate themselves or acquire apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes settle on them; they often free mothers and their children if they are slaves, under placement contracts."
10795,23,mississippi,10795," With this social capital, the people free of colour have become artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and the most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish colonies, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796," After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (seven-year war), the French gave up the Mississippi region to them under the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797," They also ceded their areas to the north east of Mississippi, including Illinois and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798," After the peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish rule as part of western Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819, the United States completed the purchase of Western Florida and all Eastern Florida under the Adams-Onís Treaty, and in 1822 the two were merged into Florida territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800," After the American Revolution (1765–83), Britain gave up the area to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801,"The territory of Mississippi was organized on April 7, 1798, from the territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States."
10802,23,mississippi,10802, Their original colonial charters extended theoretically westward as far as the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803,The territory of Mississippi was subsequently expanded twice to include the disputed territory claimed by the United States and Spain.
10804,23,mississippi,10804," From 1800 to 1830, the United States purchased land (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Amerindian tribes for new European American colonies."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mostly migrants from other southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were depleted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,"New settlers continued to encroach on the lands of Choctaw, and they urged the federal government to expel the Amerindians."
10807,23,mississippi,10807,On 27 Sept. 1830 the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the U.S. government and the Choctaw.
10808,23,mississippi,10808,The Choctaws agreed to sell their traditional lands in Mississippi and Alabama for compensation and withdrawal of reserves in Indian territory (now Oklahoma).
10809,23,mississippi,10809, This opened up land for sale at the European-American migrant establishment.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 of the Treaty allows Choctaws who choose to remain in states to become American citizens, as they are considered to abandon their tribal affiliation."
10811,23,mississippi,10811," They were the second major Amerindian ethnic group to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas instead of joining the kidnapping)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812," Today, their descendants include approximately 9,500 people who identify themselves as Choctaw, who live in the counties of Neshoba, Newton, Leake and Jones."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band reorganized in the 20th century and is a tribe recognized by the federal government.
10814,23,mississippi,10814," Many slaves brought African-American slaves with them or bought them through the slave trade, especially in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"As a result of this trade, nearly a million slaves were forcibly transported to the deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke many families of Upper South slaves, where planters sold surplus slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816,The Southists imposed laws on slaves in the deep South and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817," From 1822 on, Mississippi slaves were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishments imposed by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,"In most cases, the slave codes of the South have made the deliberate murder of a slave illegal."
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, in the Mississippi case of 1860, Oliver v. State accused the accused of killing his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820,The Mississippi became the 20th state on 10 December 1817.
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes was first governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as an ancestral land by several Amerindian tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823,"The plantations were developed mainly along the large rivers, where the seafront provided access to the main transportation routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"It is also where the first cities develop, linked by steamboats that transport commercial products and crops to the markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The rest of the Amerindian ancestral lands remained largely undeveloped, but were sold by treaty until 1826 when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826," Following the abolition of the Choctaw Tribal Government by the Mississippi State Legislative Assembly in 1829, the Indian Abduction Act of President Andrew Jackson and the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty of 1830, the Choctaws were forced to sell their lands and transported to Oklahoma territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, as well as other southeastern tribes removed as a result of the Act, became known as the Tears Trail."
10828,23,mississippi,10828," When cotton was king in the 1850s, the owners of Mississippi plantations, especially those in the central Delta and black belt regions, became rich because of the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market and the free labour acquired thanks to their African-American enslavement outfit."
10829,23,mississippi,10829, They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830,The dependence of planters on hundreds of thousands of slaves for work and the serious wealth imbalances of whites have played an important role both in state policy and in supporting planters for secession.
10831,23,mississippi,10831,The Mississippi was a slave society whose economy depended on slavery.
10832,23,mississippi,10832,"The State was very sparsely populated, with the population concentrated in riparian areas and towns."
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"In 1860, the enslaved Afro-American population numbered 436,631, representing 55 per cent of the total State population, or 791,305 persons."
10834,23,mississippi,10834," Less than 1,000 were colour-free people."
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively small population of the state prior to the civil war reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the river fronts, which formed the main transport corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836, Ninety per cent of the Delta's land base was still at the border and undeveloped.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The state needed much more settlers to develop.

10856,23,mississippi,10856," Since the Mississippi Delta contained so many fertile ground lands that had not been developed before the civil war, 90% of the land was still at the border."

11223,24,missouri,11223,"The state bears the name of the Missouri River, which bears the name of the native Indians of Missouri, a Siwan-speaking tribe."
11224,24,missouri,11224,"It is said that they were called the Ouemessourita (wimihsoorita), which means ""those who have excavation canoes"", by the Miami-Illinese language speakers."
11225,24,missouri,11225," This seems to be a popular etymology — Illinois spoke an Algonquian language and the closest approximation that can be made in that of their close neighbours, the Ojibwe, is ""You should go down and visit these people."""
11226,24,missouri,11226," This would be a strange event, because the French who first explored and tried to settle in Mississippi generally obtained their translations during this fairly precise period, often giving things French names that were accurate translations of the mother tongue(s)."
11227,24,missouri,11227," Assuming that Missouri is derived from the Siwan language, it translates as ""it connects to the side"", with reference to the river itself."
11228,24,missouri,11228,"It is not quite probable either, because it would be going out like ""Maya Sunni"" (Mah-yah soo-nee)."
11229,24,missouri,11229," Most likely, however, the name Missouri comes from Chiwere, a Siwan language spoken by people who lived in the modern states of Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri and Nebraska."
11230,24,missouri,11230,"The name ""Missouri"" has several different pronunciations even among its natives of today, the two most common being (listen) miz-UR-ee and (listen) miz-UR-."
11231,24,missouri,11231," Other pronunciations also exist in Missouri or elsewhere in the United States, involving the realization of the medial consonant as either or ; the vowel in the second syllable as either or ; and the third syllable as (phonetically [i] (listening), [=] (listening) or [==] (listening) or."
11232,24,missouri,11232, Any combination of these phonetic achievements can be seen from American English speakers.
11233,24,missouri,11233,"In England, pronunciation has been received, the preferred variant is miz-OR-ee, the setting-OR-ee being a possible alternative."
11234,24,missouri,11234," Linguistic history was definitely dealt with by Donald M. Lance, who acknowledged that the issue is sociologically complex, but no pronunciation can be declared ""correct"", nor can it be clearly defined as native or external, rural or urban, south or north, educated or otherwise."
11235,24,missouri,11235," Politicians often use multiple pronunciations, even in a single speech, to appeal to a greater number of listeners."
11236,24,missouri,11236,"In informal contexts, the name of the state, such as ""Missour-ee"" or ""Missour-uh"", is sometimes used to phonetically distinguish pronunciations."
11237,24,missouri,11237, There is no official nickname of the State.
11238,24,missouri,11238," However, Missouri's unofficial nickname is ""Show Me State"", which appears on its license plates."
11239,24,missouri,11239, This expression has many origins.
11240,24,missouri,11240,"One is largely attributed to a speech by MP Willard Vandiver in 1899, who declared that ""I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and democrats, and the sparkling eloquence does not convince me or satisfy me."
11241,24,missouri,11241,"I'm from Missouri, and you need to show me."""
11242,24,missouri,11242,"It's in agreement with the saying ""I'm from Missouri,"" meaning ""I'm sceptical about the issue and not easily convinced."""
11243,24,missouri,11243," However, according to the researchers, the expression ""show me"" was already used before the 1890s."
11244,24,missouri,11244, Another indicates that this is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville (Colorado) to replace the workers on strike.
11245,24,missouri,11245," Since the new men were not familiar with mining methods, they needed frequent instruction."
11246,24,missouri,11246," Other nicknames of the Missouri include ""The Lead State"", ""The State of Bullion"", ""The State of Ozark"", ""The Mother of the West"", ""The State of the Iron Mountain"" and ""Western Pennsylvania""."
11247,24,missouri,11247,"It is also known as the ""State of the Cave"" because there are more than 7,300 caves registered in the State (second in Tennessee)."
11248,24,missouri,11248,Perry County is the county that has the largest number of caves and the longest.
11249,24,missouri,11249,"The official motto of the state is Latin: ""Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto"", which means ""Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law""."
11250,24,missouri,11250, Indigenous peoples inhabited Missouri for thousands of years before European exploration and colonization.
11251,24,missouri,11251," Archaeological excavations along the rivers have shown a continuous habitation for over 7,000 years."
11252,24,missouri,11252," From the year 1000 there was the complex culture of Mississippi, whose inhabitants created regional political centres at present, Saint-Louis, and on the other side of the Mississippi River, at Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois."
11253,24,missouri,11253, Their large cities included thousands of individual residences.
11254,24,missouri,11254," Yet, they are known for their massive earth-moving mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platform, peak and conical form."
11255,24,missouri,11255,Cahokia was the centre of a regional trading network that reached the Great Lakes in the Gulf of Mexico.
11256,24,missouri,11256," Civilization decreased by 1400, and most descendants left the region long before the arrival of Europeans."
11257,24,missouri,11257,Saint-Louis was at a time known by American Europeans as Mound City because of the many prehistoric mounds that have survived since lost for urban development.
11258,24,missouri,11258," Mississippi culture has left mounds in the mid-Missippi and Ohio valleys, extending to the southeast and upper reaches."
11259,24,missouri,11259,The land that became the state of Missouri was part of many different territories had changing and often indeterminate borders and had many different Amerindian and European names between the 1600s and state status.
11260,24,missouri,11260,"For most of the first half of the 1700s, the western shore of the Mississippi that was to become the Missouri was largely uninhabited, a land of no man who kept peace between Illinois on the east shore of Mississippi and north, and the Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri valley."
11261,24,missouri,11261,"In the early 1700s, French merchants and missionaries explored the entire Mississippi Valley, known as the Louisiana region.At about the same time, a different group of French Canadians who established five villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River placed their colonies in Illinois, Illinois."
11262,24,missouri,11262,"Genevieve, they continued to place their colonies in Illinois country."
11263,24,missouri,11263,"At the same time, French colonies on both sides of the Mississippi River were part of the French province of Louisiana."
11264,24,missouri,11264,"To distinguish the colonies in the Middle Mississippi Valley from the French colonies in the Lower Mississippi Valley around New Orleans, French officials and residents called the Middle Mississippi Valley the Upper Louisiana, the Upper Louisiana, or the Upper Louisiana."
11265,24,missouri,11265,"The first European settlers were mainly French-Canadians, who created their first settlement in Missouri at the present time in Ste."
11266,24,missouri,11266,"Geneviève, about an hour south of St. Louis."
11267,24,missouri,11267, They had migrated about 1750 from Illinois.
11268,24,missouri,11268," They came from colonial villages on the east side of the Mississippi River, where soils were becoming exhausted, and there was not enough ground for the growing population."
11269,24,missouri,11269,"The early colonies of Missouri included many African and Amerindian slaves, and slave labour was central to commercial agriculture and the fur trade."
11270,24,missouri,11270,"Sainte-Geneviève became a prosperous agricultural centre, producing enough surplus wheat, corn and tobacco to ship tonnes of grain annually to Lower Louisiana for trade."
11271,24,missouri,11271, Grain production in Illinois was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.
11272,24,missouri,11272,Saint Louis was founded shortly afterwards by Pierre Laclède and the son-in-law Auguste Chouteau de la Nouvelle-Orléans in 1764.
11273,24,missouri,11273," From 1764 to 1803, European control of the region west of Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri basin, known as Louisiana, was assumed by the Spaniards as part of the vice-royalty of New Spain, because of the Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order for Spain to join France in the war against England)."
11274,24,missouri,11274,The Spaniards' arrival in Saint-Louis took place in September 1767.
11275,24,missouri,11275,"Saint-Louis became the centre of a regional fur trade with Amerindian tribes that expanded the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades."
11276,24,missouri,11276,The trading partners of the major companies shipped their furs from Saint-Louis through the river to New Orleans to export them to Europe.
11277,24,missouri,11277, They provided a variety of goods to merchants for sale and trade with their Amerindian customers.
11278,24,missouri,11278,The fur trade and associated companies have made St. Louis an early financial centre and provided wealth for some to build beautiful houses and import luxury goods.
11279,24,missouri,11279, Its location near Illinois confluence meant that it also treated products from agricultural areas.
11280,24,missouri,11280, Traffic and river trade along Mississippi was an integral part of the state economy.
11281,24,missouri,11281,"As the first major city in the region, Saint-Louis expanded considerably after the invention of the steamboat and the growth of river trade."
11282,24,missouri,11282, Napoleon Bonaparte had acquired Louisiana for the French ownership of Spain in 1800 under the treaty of San Ildefonso after it had been a Spanish colony since 1762.
11283,24,missouri,11283,But the treaty was kept a secret.
11284,24,missouri,11284," Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the transfer to the United States."
11285,24,missouri,11285,"Part of the purchase of Louisiana by the United States in 1803, the Missouri became known as the western gateway because it served as an important starting point for expeditions and settlers heading west during the 19th century."
11286,24,missouri,11286,"Saint-Charles, just west of Saint-Louis, was the starting point and return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which climbed on the Missouri River in 1804 to explore the lands from the west to the Pacific Ocean."
11287,24,missouri,11287,Saint-Louis has been an important supply point for decades for settler parties heading west.
11288,24,missouri,11288,"As many of the early settlers from Western Missouri emigrated from the Upper South, they brought African-American slaves as agricultural workers, and they wanted to continue their culture and the institution of slavery."
11289,24,missouri,11289," They settled mainly in 17 counties along the Missouri River, in a plains area that allowed plantation farming and became known as ""Little Dixie""."
11290,24,missouri,11290,The State was shaken by the earthquakes of 1811–12.
11291,24,missouri,11291, There were few losses due to the scarcity of the population.
11292,24,missouri,11292,"In 1821, the former Missouri territory was admitted as a slave state, under the compromise of Missouri, and with a temporary state capital in St. Charles."
11293,24,missouri,11293,"In 1826 the capital was moved to its current permanent location in Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River."
11294,24,missouri,11294," Originally, the western boundary of the state was a straight line, defined as the meridian passing through Kawsmouth, the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River."
11295,24,missouri,11295,The river has moved since this designation.
11296,24,missouri,11296, This line is known as the border of the Osage.
11297,24,missouri,11297,"In 1836, the purchase of the Platte was added to the northwest corner of the state after the land was purchased from the native tribes, making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River."
11298,24,missouri,11298," This addition increased the area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to the 65,000 square miles of Virginia, which then included West Virginia)."
11299,24,missouri,11299,"In the early 1830s, Mormon migrants from the northern states and Canada began to settle near Independence and just north of the island."
11300,24,missouri,11300," Conflicts over religion and slavery have arisen between the ""former settlers"" (mainly from the south) and the Mormons (mainly from the north)."
11301,24,missouri,11301,The War of Mormon broke out in 1838.
11302,24,missouri,11302,"In 1839, with the help of a ""order of extermination"" by Governor Lilburn Boggs, the former settlers forcibly expelled the Mormons of Missouri and confiscated their lands."
11303,24,missouri,11303, Conflicts over slavery exacerbated border tensions between states and territories.
11304,24,missouri,11304," From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with Iowa over what is known as the Honey Lands led to the call of militias from both states along the border."
11305,24,missouri,11305," With the increase in migration from the 1830s to the 1860s, the Missouri population almost doubled every decade."
11306,24,missouri,11306," Most new arrivals were born in the United States, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s."
11307,24,missouri,11307,"The majority being Catholic, they created their own religious institutions in the state, which had mostly been Protestant."
11308,24,missouri,11308," Many settled in the cities, creating a regional network and then a state network of Catholic churches and schools."
11309,24,missouri,11309,19th-century German immigrants created the wine industry along Missouri and the beer industry in Saint-Louis.
11310,24,missouri,11310," While many German immigrants were strongly anti-slavery, many Irish immigrants living in cities were pro-slavery, fearing that the liberation of African-American slaves would create a mass of unskilled labour, reducing wages."
11311,24,missouri,11311, Most farmers in Missouri were engaged in subsistence farming before the American civil war.
11312,24,missouri,11312,The majority of those who owned slaves had fewer than five each.
11313,24,missouri,11313," Planters, defined by some historians as the holders of some 20 or more slaves, were concentrated in counties known as ""Little Dixie"" in the central part of the state along the Missouri River."
11314,24,missouri,11314,Tensions on slavery relate mainly to the future of the State and the nation.
11315,24,missouri,11315,"In 1860, African-American enslaved persons accounted for less than 10 per cent of the population of the state, or 1,182,012."
11316,24,missouri,11316,"To control the flooding of agricultural land and low-lying villages along Mississippi, the state had completed the construction of 230 kilometres of dikes along the river in 1860."
11317,24,missouri,11317," After the secession of the southern states began in 1861, the Missouri parliament called for the election of a special convention on secession."
11318,24,missouri,11318,Pro-South Governor Claiborne F. Jackson ordered the mobilization of hundreds of members of the state militia who had gathered in a camp in Saint-Louis to train.
11319,24,missouri,11319," Alarmed by this action, the General Union Nathaniel Lyon strikes first, encircling the camp and forcing the troops of the state to surrender."
11320,24,missouri,11320,"Lyon directed its soldiers, largely non-English-speaking German immigrants, to walk the prisoners in the streets, and opened fire on the widely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them."

11651,25,montana,11651, Montana is a state in the northwestern part of the United States of America.
11652,25,montana,11652,"It is bordered by Idaho to the west, North Dakota and South Dakota to the east, Wyoming to the south, and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan to the north."
11653,25,montana,11653,"It is the fourth largest state per region, the eighth smallest populous state, and the third smallest densely populated state."
11654,25,montana,11654,"The western half of Montana contains many mountain ranges, while half is characterized by prairie terrain and western badlands, with more (although smaller) mountain ranges across the state."
11655,25,montana,11655,A total of 77 designated areas are in the Rocky Mountains.
11656,25,montana,11656," Montana has no official nickname, but several unofficial ones, including ""Big Sky Country"", ""The Treasure State"", ""Land of the Shining Mountains"" and ""The Last Best Place""."
11657,25,montana,11657,"The economy is mainly based on agriculture, including livestock and cereal production."
11658,25,montana,11658," Other significant economic resources include oil, gas, coal, mining and lumber."
11659,25,montana,11659,"The health, service and government sectors are also important to the government economy."
11660,25,montana,11660,"The fastest growing area in Montana is tourism, with nearly 13 million visitors per year visiting Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Beartooth Highway, Flathead Lake, Big Sky Resort and other attractions."
11661,25,montana,11661,"The name Montana comes from the Spanish word montaña, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, meaning ""mountain"" or more widely ""mountainous country""."
11662,25,montana,11662,Montaña del Norte was the name given by the first Spanish explorers to the whole western mountainous region.
11663,25,montana,11663,The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill of the United States House Committee on Territories (then chaired by James Ashley of Ohio) for the territory that would become Idaho's territory.
11664,25,montana,11664,"The name was changed by representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained Montana had ""no meaning""."
11665,25,montana,11665," When Ashley introduced a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be dug into Idaho, he again chose the territory of Montana."
11666,25,montana,11666," This time, Rep. Samuel Cox, also from Ohio, objected to the name."
11667,25,montana,11667,Cox complained that the name was a bad name because most of the territory was not mountainous and an Amerindian name would be more appropriate than a Spanish name.
11668,25,montana,11668," Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but the Territorial Committee decided that they could appoint it as they wished, so that the original name of Montana had been adopted."
11669,25,montana,11669," Montana is one of eight mountain states, located north of the region known as the Western United States."
11670,25,montana,11670,It borders North Dakota and South Dakota in the east.
11671,25,montana,11671,"Wyoming is to the south, Idaho to the west and south-west, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan are to the north, making it the only state in three Canadian provinces."
11672,25,montana,11672," With an area of 147,040 square miles (380 800 km2), Montana is slightly larger than Japan."
11673,25,montana,11673,"It is the fourth largest state in the United States after Alaska, Texas, and California; it is the largest landlocked state."
11674,25,montana,11674,"The topography of the state is roughly defined by the continental division, which divides much of the state into distinct eastern and western regions."
11675,25,montana,11675," Most of the hundreds of mountain ranges named Montana are in the western half of the state, most of which are geologically and geographically part of northern Rocky Mountains."
11676,25,montana,11676,The Absaroka and Beartooth chains in the south-central part of the state are technically part of the central Rocky Mountains.
11677,25,montana,11677,The Rocky Mountain Front is an important feature of the north-central part of the state and isolated island chains that interrupt the common prairie landscape in the central and eastern parts of the state.
11678,25,montana,11678," Approximately 60 percent of the state is a prairie, which is part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains, one of the longest continuous expanses of the Alaskan Rocky Mountains in Mexico, and smaller expanses, including the Alene Heart Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the state of Idaho."
11680,25,montana,11680,The southern third of Bitterroot's range mixes in the continental ditch.
11681,25,montana,11681," Other major mountain ranges west of the ditch include the Cabinet Mountains, Anaconda Range, Missions, Garnet Range, Sapphire Mountains, and Flint Creek Range."
11682,25,montana,11682,"The north section of the division, where the mountains quickly gave way to the prairies, was part of the Rocky Front."
11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is the most prominent in the Lewis area, located mainly in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684," Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (which begins on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska) crosses this area and turns east into Montana at Triple Divide Peak."
11685,25,montana,11685,"The Waterton, Belly, and Saint Mary rivers flow north to Alberta, Canada."
11686,25,montana,11686," There, they joined the Saskatchewan River, which eventually flowed through Hudson Bay."
11687,25,montana,11687,"To the east of the ditch, several roughly parallel ranges cover the southern part of the state, including the Gravelly Range, the Madison Range, the Gallatin Range, the Absaroka Mountains and the Beartooth Mountains."
11688,25,montana,11688,"The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass of more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) in the continental United States."

11690,25,montana,11690,"To the north of these chains are the great mountains of the belt, the Bridger Mountains, the tobacco roots, and several islands chains, including the wild mountains and the Little Belt Mountains."
11691,25,montana,11691, Between many mountain ranges there are rich river valleys.
11692,25,montana,11692,"The Big Hole Valley, the Bitterroot Valley, the Gallatin Valley, the Flathead Valley, and the Paradise Valley offer vast agricultural resources and many opportunities for tourism and recreation."
11693,25,montana,11693,"To the east and north of this transition zone are the large, sparsely populated northern plains, with plains, smaller mountain ranges and badlands."
11694,25,montana,11694,"The remote islands east of the Divide include the Bear Paw, Bull Mountains, Castle Mountains, Crazy Mountains, Highwood Mountains, Judith Mountains, Little Belt Mountains, Little Rocky Mountains, the Pryor Mountains, Little Snowy Mountains, Big Snowy Mountains, Sweet Grass Hills and — in the southeast corner of the state, near Ekalaka — the Long Pines."
11695,25,montana,11695," About 120 to 66 million years ago, many of these isolated eastern ranges were created when the magma ripped out from the inside and prostrated in front of the earth's surface."
11696,25,montana,11696,The area east of the division in the north-central part of the state is known for the Missouri Breaks and other important rock formations.
11697,25,montana,11697," Three butts south of Great Falls are important landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw and Buttes."
11698,25,montana,11698," Known as laccoliths, they formed when the igneous rock crossed cracks in the sedimentary rock."
11699,25,montana,11699,The underlying surface is composed of sandstone and shale.
11700,25,montana,11700,"The area's surface soils are very diverse and strongly affected by local geology, be it a glazed plain, an intermountainous basin, mountain foothills or plateaus."
11701,25,montana,11701,"The regions of the foothills are often covered with broken stones or slates, or consist of exposed bare rocks (usually igneous, quartzites, sandstone or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil of the intermountainous basins generally consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt and volcanic ash, much of which is made up of lakes that covered the region during the oligocene 33-23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"The trays are often surmounted with argillite gravel and worn quartzite, sometimes under the shale."
11704,25,montana,11704,"The glaciated plains are generally covered with clay, gravel, sand, and silt left by Great Falls Proglacial Lake or by moraines or former gravel-covered lake basins left by the glaciation of Wisconsin 85,000 to 11,000 years ago."
11705,25,montana,11705," Further east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka house some of the most picturesque areas of the state."
11706,25,montana,11706,The Hell Creek Formation in northeastern Montana is an important source of dinosaur fossils.

11713,25,montana,11713,The watersheds are divided at Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park.
11714,25,montana,11714," While Hudson Bay is considered to be part of the Arctic Ocean, Triple Divide Peak is the only place on Earth with a drainage of three different oceans."
11715,25,montana,11715,"All of Montana's waters, west of the divided stream, flow through the Columbia River."
11716,25,montana,11716,"The Columbia Clark fork (not to be confused with the Clarks fork of the Yellowstone River) rises near Butte and flows northwest as far as Missoula, where it is joined by the Blackfoot River and the Bitterroot River."
11717,25,montana,11717," Further downstream, it is reached by the Flathead River before entering Idaho near Lake Pend Oreille."
11718,25,montana,11718,The Pend Oreille River forms the exit from Lake Pend Oreille.
11719,25,montana,11719,"The Pend Oreille River joined the Columbia River, flowing to the Pacific Ocean, making the Clark Fork/Pend Oreille River, 932 km long, the longest of the Rocky Mountains."

11732,25,montana,11732,"It flows north through Yellowstone National Park, enters Montana near Gardiner, and passes through the Paradise Valley to Livingston."
11733,25,montana,11733,"It then crosses the northeast of the state through Billings, Miles City, Glendive and Sidney."
11734,25,montana,11734,Yellowstone joins Missouri in North Dakota just east of Fort Union.

11782,25,montana,11782,Winter cold spells are generally the result of cold continental air coming from southern Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The forehead is often well defined, which causes a sharp drop in temperature in 24 hours."
11784,25,montana,11784," Conversely, the southwest airflow translates into ""chinooks."""
11785,25,montana,11785," These steady winds from 25 to 50 mph (40 to 80 km/h) (or more) can suddenly warm up parts of Montana, especially areas just east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise to 50 to 60 degrees F (10 to 15.6 degrees Celsius) for 10 days or more."

11800,25,montana,11800,"Winters are warmer too, and have fewer cold spells."
11801,25,montana,11801," Previously, these cold spells had killed bark beetles, but they now attack forests in western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the area have allowed various species to expand their range and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, beetle attack and poor management has led to a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804," According to a study by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some parts of Montana will experience a 200 per cent increase in forest fire burning and 80 per cent in related air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below shows the average temperatures of the warmest and coldest month for the seven largest cities in Montana.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on location, although the figures are generally similar."
11807,25,montana,11807, Montana is one of only two contiguous states (with Colorado) that are antipodal to shore.

11809,25,montana,11809,"No city is exactly antipodal of Kerguelen, although Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples have lived in the territory of the present state of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811," Historical tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers in the United States included the Crow in the south-central, Cheyenne in the south-east, Blackfeet, Assiniboine and Gros Ventres in the centre and north-central, and Kootenai and Salish in the west."
11812,25,montana,11812,The smallest tribes of Pend d'Oreille and Kalispel lived near Flathead Lake and the western mountains respectively.

11814,25,montana,11814,The lands of Montana east of the continental division were part of the purchase of Louisiana in 1803.
11815,25,montana,11815," After and especially in the decades after the Lewis and Clark expeditions, American, British and French traders operated a fur trade, usually working with Aboriginal peoples, in the eastern and western parts of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816," These transactions have not always been peaceful, and although the fur trade has brought material gain to indigenous tribal groups, it has also led to exposure to European diseases and changed their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The Fort Raymond trading post (1807–11) was built in Crow Indian country in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818," Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), the lands west of the continental ditch were disputed between the British and the United States and were known as Oregon countries."
11819,25,montana,11819,The first permanent establishment by Euro-Americans in what is today Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near Stevensville today.
11820,25,montana,11820,In 1847 Fort Benton became the highest fur trading post on the Missouri River.
11821,25,montana,11821,"In the 1850s, settlers began to settle in the Beaverhead and Big Hole valleys from the Oregon Trail and the Clark fork valley."
11822,25,montana,11822,The first gold discovered in Montana was at Gold Creek near the current garrison in 1852.
11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state from 1862 onward found gold, silver, copper, lead and coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the region."
11824,25,montana,11824,"The richest of all gold-placer digs was discovered in Alder Gulch, where the city of Virginia City was established."
11825,25,montana,11825," Other rich placer deposits have been found in Last Chance Gulch, now home to the city of Helen, Confeder Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City."
11826,25,montana,11826,Gold production from 1862 to 1876 reached 144 million dollars
11827,25,montana,11827,"The largest mining operations were in the city of Butte, which had large deposits of huge silver and copper."
11828,25,montana,11828," Prior to the establishment of Montana (1864–89), today's Montana regions were part of Oregon (1848–59), Washington (1853–63), Idaho (1863–64) and Dakota (1861–64)."
11829,25,montana,11829," Montana became the territory of the United States (Territory of Montana) on May 26, 1864."
11830,25,montana,11830,The first territorial capital was at Bannack.
11831,25,montana,11831,The first territorial governor was Sidney Edgarton.
11832,25,montana,11832,The capital moved to Virginia City in 1865 and to Helena in 1875.
11833,25,montana,11833,"By 1870, the non-Indian population of Montana was 20,595."
11834,25,montana,11834,"The Montana Historical Society, founded on February 2, 1865 in Virginia City, is the oldest such institution west of Mississippi (excluding Louisiana)."
11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870 respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and Washburn–Langford–Doane expeditions were launched from Helen into the Upper Yellowstone area and led directly to the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As the settlers began to populate Montana from the 1850s to the 1870s, disputes ensued with the Amerindians, mainly over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, the territorial governor of Washington, Isaac Stevens, negotiated the Hellgate treaty between the U.S. government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai of western Montana, which established boundaries for tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838,The Treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839," While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reserve, the difficulty with the interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led the whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was open to colonization, but the tribal nations challenged these provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first U.S. Army post established in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect steamship traffic going to Fort Benton."
11842,25,montana,11842,More than a dozen additional military outposts have been established in the state.
11843,25,montana,11843, Pressure on land ownership and control has increased due to gold discoveries in various regions of Montana and surrounding states.
11844,25,montana,11844,"Major battles took place in Montana during the Red Cloud War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, the Nez Perce War, and in conflicts with Piegan Blackfeet."
11845,25,montana,11845,"The most remarkable are the Marias Massacre (1870), the Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), the Battle of the Great Trou (1877) and the Battle of Bear Paw (1877)."
11846,25,montana,11846,The last conflict in Montana between the U.S. Army and the Amerindians took place in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in the country of Big Horn.
11847,25,montana,11847,Indian survivors who had signed treaties were generally required to reserve.
11848,25,montana,11848," Along with these conflicts, bison, a key species, and the main source of proteins on which Aboriginal people had survived for centuries, were destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849," According to some estimates, more than 13 million bison were found in Montana in 1870."
11850,25,montana,11850,"In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded for a joint session of Congress to authorize the slaughter of herds in order to deprive the Indians of their food source."
11851,25,montana,11851,"In 1884, commercial hunting had led the bison to the brink of extinction; only 325 bison remained throughout the United States."
11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle farming is at the heart of Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and exchanged fattened cattle in fertile Montana valleys with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.
11853,25,montana,11853,Nelson Story brought Texas Longhorn's first cattle into the Territory in 1866.
11854,25,montana,11854,"Granville Stuart, Samuel Hauser and Andrew J. Davis began a large open-air cattle operation in Fergus County in 1879."
11855,25,montana,11855,The Ranch Grant-Kohrs National Historic Site at Deer Lodge is now maintained as a link to the late 19th-century ranch style.
11856,25,montana,11856,"Operated by the National Parks Service, this is a 1,900-acre ranch (7.7 km2)."
11857,25,montana,11857,The Northern Pacific Railroad (NPR) tracks reached Montana from the west in 1881 and from the east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858," However, in the 1870s, the railway played a major role in tensions with the Amerindian tribes."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, president of the NPR, launched important surveys in the Yellowstone Valley in 1871, 1872 and 1873, which the Sioux strongly contested under Chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860," These clashes, in part, contributed to the panic of 1873, a financial crisis which delayed the construction of the railway in Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"The surveys carried out in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped trigger the Great Sioux War of 1876."
11862,25,montana,11862,"The transcontinental RPN was completed on September 8, 1883, at Gold Creek."
11863,25,montana,11863,"The Great Northern Railway (GNR) tracks reached the east of Montana in 1887, and when they reached the north of the Rockies in 1890, the GNR became a major tourism promoter in the Glacier National Park area."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893, at Scenic, Washington."
11865,25,montana,11865,"In 1881, the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch of the Union Pacific, completed a narrow line from northern Utah to Butte."
11866,25,montana,11866,"A number of smaller spur lines operated in Montana from 1881 to the 20th century, including the Oregon Short Line, Montana Railway, and Milwaukee Road."
11867,25,montana,11867," Under the authority of Territorial Governor Thomas Meagher, the Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a failed candidacy for state status."
11868,25,montana,11868,"A second constitutional convention, held in Helena in 1884, produced a Constitution ratified by the citizens of Montana in November 1884."
11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress only approved state status in Montana in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting state status in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington after the appropriate state constitutions had been drafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,In July 1889 the Montanas convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government.
11871,25,montana,11871,"On November 8, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana the 41st state of the union."

11873,25,montana,11873,"In the 1880s, Helena (the capital of the state) had more millionaires per capita than any other city in the United States."
11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land to settlers who could claim and ""proven"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875, Montana did not see a large influx of immigrants under the Act because 160 acres were generally insufficient to support a family in the arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,"In 1868 David Carpenter, near Helen, made the first claim of ownership under the Montana law."
11877,25,montana,11877,"The first claim of a woman was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of the pioneer of Deer Lodge Montana, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"In 1880 the farms were in the greener valleys of central and western Montana, but few were in the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Lands Act of 1877 was adopted to permit the establishment of arid lands in the west and allocated 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a $25 per acre price and a promise of irrigation of the land.
11880,25,montana,11880," After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would belong to the settler."
11881,25,montana,11881," This law brought most of the cattle and sheep farmers to Montana, many of whom took their herds to the Montana prairie for three years, did not do much to irrigate the land, then abandoned it without paying the last fee."
11882,25,montana,11882," Some farmers came with the arrival of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railways in the 1880s and 1890s, although in relatively small numbers."
11883,25,montana,11883,"In the early 1900s James J. Hill, from the Great North, began to promote the settlement on the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods."
11884,25,montana,11884, Other railways followed the example.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the Rehabilitation Act was adopted, allowing the construction of irrigation projects in the eastern river valleys of Montana."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909, Congress passed the Extended Houses Act, which extended the area of open land from 160 acres to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family and, in 1912, reduced the time to ""prove"" a claim to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Homesteads Act allowed 640 acres of homesteads in areas unfit for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888," This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of landowners, attracted by free land, with the First World War bringing particularly high wheat prices."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana was going through a temporary period of above-average precipitation."
11890,25,montana,11890," Owners arriving in this period were known as ""Honyockers"", or ""scissors""."
11891,25,montana,11891," Although the word ""honyocker"", perhaps derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisory way to the owners as ""green horns"", ""new to his business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had agricultural experience, although many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892," However, farmers are facing a number of problems."
11893,25,montana,11893,A huge debt was one of them.
11894,25,montana,11894,"In addition, most settlers came from wetter regions, were not prepared for dry climate, lack of trees, and scarcity of water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small homes of less than 320 acres (130 ha) were not suitable for the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896,The climatic and agricultural conditions are much harsher and drier to the west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897, Then the droughts of 1917-1921 proved devastating.
11898,25,montana,11898," Many people left, and half of the state banks went bankrupt by providing mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, the size of farms has increased, while the number of farms has decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"In 1910, the owners filed claims on more than five million acres, and in 1923, over 93 million acres were cultivated."
11901,25,montana,11901,"In 1910, the Great Falls Land Office alone had more than a thousand property deposits per month, and at the top of 1917-1918, it had 14,000 new properties every year."
11902,25,montana,11902,Major falls occurred as a result of the 1919 drought.
11903,25,montana,11903,"At the beginning of the First World War, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States declaration of war."
11904,25,montana,11904," His actions were widely criticized in Montana, where war support and patriotism were strong."
11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917–2018, due to a miscalculation of the population of Montana, approximately 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the state population, volunteered or were recruited into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906, This represented a contribution by the labour force to the war that was 25 per cent higher than any other state on a per capita basis.
11907,25,montana,11907," Approximately 1500 Montanans died as a result of the war and 2437 were injured, also more than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908,"The Montana Remount station in Miles City provided 10,000 horse cavalry horses for the war, more than any other army post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for Montana's mining, forestry and agricultural interests, as the demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the American Congress adopted the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the Sedition Act of 1918."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Assemblée du Montana passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912,"In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, the military, or symbols by speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana Act led to the arrest of more than 200 people and the conviction of 78 people, mainly of German or Austrian origin."
11914,25,montana,11914,More than 40 people have spent time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, Governor Brian Schweitzer posthumously handed over all persons convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed the entry of the United States into the war included groups of immigrants of German and Irish origin, as well as pacifist anabaptists such as the Hutterites and Mennonites, many of whom were also of Germanic origin."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-war groups such as the Montana Council of Defense, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and local ""loyalty committees""."
11918,25,montana,11918,The feeling of war was complicated by work problems.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The Anaconda Copper Company, which was at its historic peak in copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and trade unions that were trying to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multi-ethnic community of major European immigrants, trade unions, in particular the new Metal Mining Workers' Union, opposed the war on the grounds that they mostly benefited from important interests in the timber and mining sector."
11921,25,montana,11921," Following the explosion of mining production and the disaster of the speculator mine in June 1917, Frank Little, world organizer of industrial workers, arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave speeches with incendiary antiwar rhetoric.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On 1 August 1917, he was dragged from his boarding school by masked vigilantes, and hanged on a railway lattice, considered a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,The murder of Little and the ensuing strikes led the National Guard to be sent to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925," Overall, anti-German and anti-labor sentiment has increased and created a movement that led to the adoption of the Montana Sedition Act the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Defence Council had become a State body empowered to prosecute and punish persons tried in violation of the law."
11927,25,montana,11927,The Council also adopted rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting the expression of German in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"In the wake of the legislative action of 1918, emotions increased."
11929,25,montana,11929,U.S. prosecutor Burton K. Wheeler and several District Court judges who hesitated to prosecute or convict accused persons were strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930," Wheeler was brought before the Defence Council, although he avoided formal proceedings, and a judge of the Forsyth District Court was indicted."
11931,25,montana,11931, There were German-language book burns and several quasi-hangings.
11932,25,montana,11932,The ban on German speaking remained in force at the beginning of the 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Complimenting the war struggles, the 1918 influenza epidemic claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanians."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that took place led some historians to dub this period ""the agony of Montana""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after the First World War and lasted during the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936," This has caused great difficulties for farmers, herders and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937," Wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state an important producer; wheat has a relatively high protein content, which requires high prices."
11938,25,montana,11938," When the United States entered the Second World War on December 8, 1941, many Montanas had enlisted in the army to escape the bad national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Over 40,000 Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war, and more than 57,000 joined before the end of the war."
11940,25,montana,11940," These figures represented about ten per cent of the population of the state, and Montana again contributed to one of the largest numbers of soldiers per capita in any state."
11941,25,montana,11941," Many Native Americans were among those who served, including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,"At least 1,500 Montanans died during the war."
11943,25,montana,11943," Montana was also the training ground of the First Special Service Force or ""Devil's Brigade"", an American commando-type joint force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for the mountain and winter conditions prior to its deployment."
11944,25,montana,11944,"Air bases were built at Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank and Glasgow, some of which were used as staging areas to prepare aircraft for Soviet Union allied forces."
11945,25,montana,11945," During the war, some 30 Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs landed in Montana, although no victims or major forest fires were attributed to them."
11946,25,montana,11946,In 1940 Jeannette Rankin was again elected to Congress.
11947,25,montana,11947,"In 1941, as in 1917, she voted against the US declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
11948,25,montana,11948," His was the only vote against the war, and following a public outcry about his vote, Rankin demanded police protection for some time."
11949,25,montana,11949," Other pacifists tended to be those of the ""peace churches"" who generally opposed war."
11950,25,montana,11950, Many people claiming the U.S. conscientious objector status were sent to Montana during the war as smoke jumpers and for other tasks of fighting forest fires.
11951,25,montana,11951,"In 1942, the U.S. Army established Camp Rimini near Helen to train sled dogs in wintertime."
11952,25,montana,11952," During the Second World War, the planned combat ship USMontana was named in honor of the State, but it was never completed."
11953,25,montana,11953, Montana is the only one of the first 48 states that do not have a full warship to be named on its behalf.
11954,25,montana,11954, Alaska and Hawaii both have nuclear submarines that bear their names.
11955,25,montana,11955, Montana is the only State of the Union without a modern naval ship named in its honour.
11956,25,montana,11956," However, in August 2007, Senator Jon Tester asked for a submarine to be named USMontana."

12592,27,nevada,12592,The new areas acquired by the United States continue to be administered as territories.
12593,27,nevada,12593,"In the framework of the Mexican Cessation (1848) and the California Gold Rush which then used Emigrant Trails across the region, the State region first evolved as part of the territory of Utah, then of the territory of Nevada (2 March 1861; named in honour of Sierra Nevada)."
12594,27,nevada,12594," See History of Utah, History of Las Vegas, and the discovery of the first major American silver ore deposit at Comstock Lode under Virginia City, Nevada, in 1859."
12595,27,nevada,12595,"On 2 March 1861 the territory of Nevada separated from the territory of Utah and adopted its present name, abbreviated from Sierra Nevada (Spanish for ""snow-covered mountain range"")."
12596,27,nevada,12596,The southern border of 1861 is commemorated by Nevada Historical Markers 57 and 58 in Lincoln and Nye counties.
12597,27,nevada,12597," Eight days before the presidential election of 1864, Nevada became the 36th state of union, despite the absence of the minimum number of 60,000 residents required to become a state."
12598,27,nevada,12598,"(At that time, the population of Nevada was only 10,000.)"
12599,27,nevada,12599," Rather than sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27 – the most expensive telegraph on file at the time for a single expedition."
12600,27,nevada,12600," Finally, Washington's answer came on October 31, 1864: ""the pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day has been admitted into the Union""."
12601,27,nevada,12601,"The state was rushed on 31 October to help secure the re-election of Abraham Lincoln on 8 November and Republican domination after the civil war in Congress, since the Nevada mining economy linked him to the more industrialized Union."
12602,27,nevada,12602,"As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the election hand in hand and did not need Nevada's help."
12603,27,nevada,12603, Nevada is one of the only two states to considerably expand its borders after its admission to the Union.
12604,27,nevada,12604,"(The other was Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 because of Platte's purchase.)"
12605,27,nevada,12605,"In 1866, another part of the territory of western Utah was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state, setting the present eastern boundary."
12606,27,nevada,12606," Nevada reached its present southern boundary on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the part of Pah-Ute County in Arizona territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of the present Nevada south of the 37th parallel."
12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was caused by the discovery of gold in the region, and officials thought that Nevada would be better able to oversee the expected population boom."
12608,27,nevada,12608, This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12609,27,nevada,12609, Mining has shaped the Nevada economy for many years (see Silver mining in Nevada).
12610,27,nevada,12610," When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It, mining had led to an industry of speculation and vast wealth."
12611,27,nevada,12611, Mining and population declined temporarily at the end of the 19th century.
12612,27,nevada,12612," However, the rich silver strike in Tonopah in 1900, followed by strikes in Goldfield and Rhyolite, created a second mining boom in Nevada and the Nevada population."
12613,27,nevada,12613,"Unregulated gambling was common in the first mining towns in Nevada, but was banned in 1909 as part of a national anti-gambling crusade."
12614,27,nevada,12614," Due to subsequent declines in mining production and the decline in the agricultural sector during the Great Depression, Nevada again legalized the game on March 19, 1931, with the approval of the legislature."
12615,27,nevada,12615, Governor Fred B. Balzar's signature has promulgated the most liberal laws on divorce in the country and open gambling.

12618,27,nevada,12618,"The site consists of approximately 1,350 square miles (3,500 km2) of desert and mountainous terrain."
12619,27,nevada,12619," Nuclear tests at the Nevada test site began with a 1 kiloton TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951."
12620,27,nevada,12620,"The last atmospheric test was conducted on 17 July 1962, and underground weapons tests continued until 23 September 1992."
12621,27,nevada,12621,The place is known to have the highest concentration of nuclear weapons detonated in the United States
12622,27,nevada,12622,More than 80% of the state region is owned by the federal government.
12623,27,nevada,12623,The main reason is that homesteads have not been allowed in sufficient size to be viable under the arid conditions prevailing in the Nevada desert.
12624,27,nevada,12624," Instead, the first settlers would house land surrounding a water source and then graze livestock on adjacent public lands, which is unnecessary for agriculture without access to water (this model of livestock farming still prevails)."
12625,27,nevada,12625,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of Nevada was 3,080,156 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 45,764 (1.51%) since the 2018 U.S. Census estimate and an increase of 379,605 (14.06 per cent) since the 2010 U.S. Census."

12628,27,nevada,12628,Women accounted for about 49.5 per cent of the population.
12629,27,nevada,12629," Since the 2010 census, the population of Nevada has experienced a natural increase of 87,581 people (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 people (including 104,032 from internal migration and 42,594 from international migration)."
12630,27,nevada,12630, Nevada's population centre is located in southern Nye County.
12631,27,nevada,12631,"In this county, the unincorporated city of Pahrump, 97 km west of Las Vegas, on the California state line, grew very rapidly from 1980 to 2010."

12633,27,nevada,12633," Las Vegas grew from a mulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1970 and was the fastest growing city and metropolitan area in America between 1960 and 2000."
12634,27,nevada,12634," Between the 1940s and 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing country in the United States."
12635,27,nevada,12635," Between 1990 and 2000, the population of Nevada increased by 66 per cent, while the population of the country increased by 13 per cent."
12636,27,nevada,12636,"Over two-thirds of the population lives in Clark County, which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12637,27,nevada,12637," Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation."
12638,27,nevada,12638,"Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the 20 fastest growing cities in the United States with over 100,000 inhabitants."
12639,27,nevada,12639,The rural community of Mesquite 105 km northeast of Las Vegas was an example of micropolitical growth in the 1990s and 2000s.
12640,27,nevada,12640, Other desert cities such as Indian Springs and Searchlight on the outskirts of Las Vegas have also seen some growth.

12645,27,nevada,12645,"The five most important groups of non-Hispanic white ancestry were German (11.3%), Irish (9.0%), English (6.9%), Italian (5.8%) and American (4.7%)."
12646,27,nevada,12646,"In 1980, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 83.3% of the population of the state."
12647,27,nevada,12647,"In 2011, 63.6 per cent of the population of Nevada under the age of 1 were minorities."
12648,27,nevada,12648, Las Vegas is a majority minority town.
12649,27,nevada,12649," According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, as of 1 July 2018, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 48.7% of the Nevada population."

12662,27,nevada,12662,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, with Hispanics counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."
12663,27,nevada,12663,A small percentage of Nevada's population lives in rural areas.
12664,27,nevada,12664,The culture of these places differs considerably from the larger metropolitan areas.
12665,27,nevada,12665,"The inhabitants of these rural counties tend to be native residents of Nevada, unlike the Las Vegas and Reno regions, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state."
12666,27,nevada,12666,The rural population is also less diverse from the point of view of race and ethnicity.
12667,27,nevada,12667," Mining plays an important role in rural county economies, with tourism being less important."

12670,27,nevada,12670,"In a 2009 Gallup poll, only 30% of Nevadas reported that they attended the weekly or almost weekly church, compared with 42% of all Americans (it was found that only four states had a lower attendance rate than Nevada)."

12681,27,nevada,12681, Nevada's economy has long been linked to the vice-industries.
12682,27,nevada,12682,"""Nevada was founded on mining and re-founded on sin – beginning with the fight against prices and easy divorce a century ago, then extending to gambling and prostitution,"" said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist."
12683,27,nevada,12683,"In some parts of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas, mining plays a major economic role."
12684,27,nevada,12684,"By value, gold is by far the most important mineral mine."

12689,27,nevada,12689, Livestock rearing is a major economic activity in rural Nevada.
12690,27,nevada,12690," Nevada's agricultural products include cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions and potatoes."
12691,27,nevada,12691,"As of 1 January 2006, there were about 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada."

12696,27,nevada,12696,"Amtrak's California Zephyr train uses the original Union Pacific Transcontinental Railway line on a daily basis from Chicago to Emeryville, California, serving Elko, Winnemucca and Reno."
12697,27,nevada,12697, Las Vegas has not had a passenger train service since the end of the Desert Wind in Amtrak in 1997.
12698,27,nevada,12698,"Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provides a connecting service from Las Vegas to the trains in Needles, California, Los Angeles and Bakersfield, California; and from Stateline, Nevada, to Sacramento, California."
12699,27,nevada,12699,A number of proposals were made to reintroduce the service in Los Angeles or southern California.
12700,27,nevada,12700,The Union Pacific Railway has a few railways in the north and south of Nevada.

12703,27,nevada,12703,The I-215 and I-515 also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12704,27,nevada,12704,"The I-80s cross the northern portion of Nevada, following roughly the Humboldt River trail from Utah to the east and the Truckee River to the west through Reno, California."

12708,27,nevada,12708," Many counties in Nevada also have a county road system, although many are not signed or paved in rural areas."
12709,27,nevada,12709, Nevada is one of the few states in the United States that do not have a continuous interstate highway connecting its two major population centres – the road link between the Las Vegas and Reno regions is a combination of several interstate and American highways.
12710,27,nevada,12710,The routing proposed by Interstate 11 could possibly remedy this.
12711,27,nevada,12711,"The State is one of the few in the country to allow semi-trailers with three trailers – which could be called a ""road train"" in Australia."
12712,27,nevada,12712,"But American versions are usually smaller, partly because they have to climb and descend steep mountain passes."
12713,27,nevada,12713,RTC Transit is the public transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12714,27,nevada,12714,"The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a network of bus services across the Las Vegas Valley, including the use of The Deuce, a two-storey bus, on the Las Vegas Strip and several peripheral routes."

12720,27,nevada,12720," Several hotels also manage their own monorail lines, which are usually several blocks of length."

12723,27,nevada,12723, Nevada has a flourishing solar energy sector.
12724,27,nevada,12724,An independent study conducted in 2013 found that solar energy users had created a net benefit of $36 million.
12725,27,nevada,12725," However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission allowed the State's only electricity company, NV Energy, to charge higher rates and charges to solar panel users, resulting in an immediate collapse in the use of solar panels on the roof."
12726,27,nevada,12726,"In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository as the only site to be considered a permanent repository for all highly radioactive waste in the country."
12727,27,nevada,12727," Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Government of Nevada are divided into three separate departments: the executive composed of the Governor of Nevada and their cabinet, as well as the other elected members of the Constitution; the legislature consisting of the Nevada Legislative Assembly, which includes the Assembly and the Senate; and the judiciary composed of the Nevada Supreme Court and the lower courts."
12728,27,nevada,12728,"The Governor is the Chief Magistrate of Nevada, the Head of the Executive Department of the Government of the State and the Commander-in-Chief of the State Military Forces."
12729,27,nevada,12729,"The current governor is Steve Sisolak, a democrat."
12730,27,nevada,12730,The Legislature of Nevada is a bicameral body divided into an assembly and a senator.
12731,27,nevada,12731," Members of the Assembly serve for two years, and members of the Senator for four years."
12732,27,nevada,12732,"The two Houses of the Nevada Legislative Assembly will be affected by the terms of office from 2010, since senators and MPs/women will be limited to a maximum of 12 years in each chamber (by appointment or election that is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the Constitution that has recently been confirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court in a unanimous decision."
12733,27,nevada,12733," Each session of Parliament meets for a constitutional term of 120 days each odd year, or more if the governor calls for an extraordinary session."
12734,27,nevada,12734,"On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States to have a women's majority in its legislature."

12736,27,nevada,12736,The Nevada Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the State and the head of the Nevada Judiciary.
12737,27,nevada,12737," Initial jurisdiction is divided between District Courts (with general jurisdiction), Courts and Municipal Courts (both of limited jurisdiction)."
12738,27,nevada,12738," Appeals from district courts are addressed directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which, in the context of a model derogatory jurisdiction, has the discretion to refer cases to the Court of Appeal for final resolution."
12739,27,nevada,12739,"The cities incorporated in Nevada, known as cities, are empowered to legislate on anything not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to enable local authorities to integrate the cities of Nevada in order to give them more flexibility and less restrictions on the part of the Legislative Assembly.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"Municipal councils for unincorporated cities are limited local administrations created either by the local county commission or by referendum, and constitute a purely consultative role and do not in any way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"By 1900, Nevada's population was the smallest of all states and was decreasing, as the difficulties of living in a ""wild desert"" began to prevail over the lure of money for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743,The historian Lawrence Friedman explained what happened next:

13612,29,new_jersey,13612,"The Act offers many choices to communities that prefer strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and provides great flexibility to allow municipalities to choose the characteristics of their government: the number of seats on the council; the seats chosen in general, by neighbourhoods or by a combination of the two; staggered or concurrent mandates; and a mayor chosen by the council or directly elected by voters."

13615,29,new_jersey,13615," Although municipalities retain their names derived from the types of government, they may have changed for one of the modern forms of government, or even more so in the past for one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities whose official names are completely flouting for the general public."

13633,29,new_jersey,13633,"For many years, however, it was a Republican bastion, having given comfortable margin of victory to the Republican candidate in the tight elections of 1948, 1968 and 1976."

14115,31,new_york,14115," This completely changed the ethnography of the region, and most of the big game was hunted before the whites completely exploded the land."

14125,31,new_york,14125," When the United States drafted the Indian Removal Act, the Lenapes were transferred to Missouri, while their cousins, the Mohicans, were sent to Wisconsin."
14126,31,new_york,14126,"In addition, in 1778 the United States relocated the Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario, although they did not stay long."

14152,31,new_york,14152,"At the same time, given the close commercial, personal and sentimental ties with Britain, many New York residents were loyalists."
14153,31,new_york,14153,The capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the gun and powder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the siege of Boston in 1775.

14741,32,north_carolina,14741," Although the Fifteenth Amendment was also adopted in the same year, in most cases it remained ineffective for almost a century, not to mention paramilitary groups and their lynching with impunity."

14749,32,north_carolina,14749," Meanwhile, the famous Crop-Link system has developed and has been financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to large amounts of wear and tear."

16236,36,oregon,16236,"It is possible that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, because there is a stream in Spain called ""Arroyo del Oregón"" (which is located in the province of Ciudad Real); it is also possible that the ""j"" in the Spanish expression ""El Orejón"" was then corrupted into a ""g"", and in the context could refer to the ""aurore"" of the massive Columbia River at its mouth."
16237,36,oregon,16237," Another early use of the name, spelled Ouragon, was by Major Robert Rogers in a petition of 1765 to the Kingdom of Great Britain."
16238,36,oregon,16238,The term refers to the then mythical western river (the Columbia River).
16239,36,oregon,16239,In 1778 the spelling had moved to Oregon.
16240,36,oregon,16240,Rogers has written:
16241,36,oregon,16241,"One theory is that the name comes from the French word Ouragan (""windstorm"" or ""hurricane""), which was applied to the West River from Indian tales of powerful Chinook winds on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from the first-hand French experience with the winds of Chinook des Grandes Plaines."
16242,36,oregon,16242,"At the time, the western river was thought to rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the great plains."
16243,36,oregon,16243,Joaquin Miller explained in the magazine Sunset in 1904 how the name Oregon was derived:
16244,36,oregon,16244," Another narrative, approved as ""the most plausible explanation"" in the book Oregon Geographic Names, was advanced by George R. Stewart in an article from 1944 in American Speech."
16245,36,oregon,16245," According to Stewart, the name comes from the error of a engraver in a French map published in the early 18th century, on which the Ouisiconink River (Wisconsin) was spelled ""Ouaricon-sint"", broken on two lines with the -sint below, so there seems to be a river flowing west called ""Ouaricon""."
16246,36,oregon,16246," According to the Oregon Tourism Commission, today's Oregonans pronounce the name of the state as ""or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or."
16247,36,oregon,16247," After being written by the Detroit Lions in 2002, the former Oregon Duck quarterback Joey Harrington distributed ""Orygun"" stickers to members of the media reminding them of how to pronounce the name of his original state."

16258,36,oregon,16258,"In western Oregon: the Oregon coast (west of the coastal chain), the Willamette Valley, the Rogue Valley, the Cascade Range and the Klamath Mountains; and in central and eastern Oregon: the Columbia Plateau, the Upper Desert, and the Blue Mountains."
16259,36,oregon,16259,The Oregon is located in two time zones.
16260,36,oregon,16260," Most of Malheur County is in the mountain time zone, while the rest of the state is in the Pacific time zone."
16261,36,oregon,16261,"The mountainous areas of western Oregon, home to three of the largest peaks in the United States, including Mount Hood, were formed by the volcanic activity of the Juan de Fuca Plate, a tectonic plaque that constitutes a continuous threat of volcanic activity and earthquakes in the region."
16262,36,oregon,16262,The most recent major activity was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake.
16263,36,oregon,16263,"Mount St. Helens of Washington erupted in 1980, a visible event in northern Oregon affecting parts of Oregon."
16264,36,oregon,16264,"The Columbia River, which forms a large part of the northern border of Oregon, has also played an important role in the geological development of the region, as well as in its economic and cultural development."
16265,36,oregon,16265,The Columbia River is one of the largest rivers in North America and one of two rivers across the Cascades (the Klamath River in southern Oregon is the other).
16266,36,oregon,16266," About 15,000 years ago, the Columbia River flooded much of Oregon many times during the Missoula floods; the modern fertility of the Willamette Valley is largely the result."
16267,36,oregon,16267,"For thousands of years, many salmon have turned parts of the river, such as Celilo Falls, into centres of economic activity."
16268,36,oregon,16268," Today, Oregon's landscape varies from rainforest in the coastal chain to the sterile desert in the southeast, which still meets the technical definition of a border."
16269,36,oregon,16269,The geographic centre of Oregon is further west than the other 48 contiguous states (although the westernmost point of the 48 lower states is in Washington).
16270,36,oregon,16270,The geographic characteristics of the centre of Oregon range from high volcanic and desert rock formations resulting from lava beds.
16271,36,oregon,16271, Oregon Badlands Wilderness is located in this part of the state.
16272,36,oregon,16272," Typical of a western state, Oregon is home to a unique and diverse fauna."

16283,36,oregon,16283,"The western Oregon climate is strongly influenced by the Pacific Ocean; the western third of Oregon is very humid in winter, moderately to very humid in spring and fall, and dry in summer."
16284,36,oregon,16284,"The relative humidity of western Oregon is high except for summer days, which are semi-dry to semi-wet; eastern Oregon generally has low year-round humidity."

16286,36,oregon,16286,"The northeastern part of Oregon has a steppe climate, and its high terrain areas have a subarctic climate."
16287,36,oregon,16287," Like Western Europe, Oregon and the Pacific Northwest in general are considered warm for latitude, and the state has much milder winters at a given altitude than comparable latitudes elsewhere in North America, such as Upper Midwest, Ontario, Quebec and New England."
16288,36,oregon,16288," However, the state ranked fifth for the coolest summer temperatures in any state of the country, after Maine, Idaho, Wyoming and Alaska."

16291,36,oregon,16291," While most of Oregon has significant snowfalls, the Willamette Valley, home to 60 per cent of the population, has much milder winters for its latitude and generally sees only slight snowfalls."
16292,36,oregon,16292,"The highest temperature recorded in Oregon was 119°F (48°C) at Pendleton on 10 August 1898, and the lowest recorded temperature was −54°F (−48°C) at Senatorca on 10 February 1933."

16300,36,oregon,16300," During the prehistoric period, the Willamette Valley area was flooded after the collapse of the ice dams from Missoula Lake, which later became Montana."
16301,36,oregon,16301, These massive floods occurred during the last glacial period and filled the valley 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) of water.

17860,40,south_dakota,17860," Despite the growth of the State's population and recent economic development, many rural areas have struggled over the past 50 years with the decline of local populations and the emigration of educated young adults to major cities in South Dakota, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states."
17861,40,south_dakota,17861,Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture have greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of small family farms and the resulting economic and demographic problems for rural cities.

17896,40,south_dakota,17896,The low birth rate and the lack of younger immigration have led to an increase in the median age of many of these counties.

18094,41,tennessee,18094,"At the beginning of the 18th century, British merchants met a city of Cherokee called Tanasi (or ""Tanase"", in the syllable : """") in the present Monroe County, Tennessee."
18095,41,tennessee,18095,"The city was located on a river of the same name (now known as the Little Tennessee River), and appears on the maps as early as 1725."
18096,41,tennessee,18096,"It is not known whether it was the same city as Juan Pardo's, although recent research suggests that Pardo's ""Tanasqui"" was located at the confluence of the Pigeon River and the French Broad River, near the modern Newport."
18097,41,tennessee,18097,The meaning and origin of the word is uncertain.
18098,41,tennessee,18098, Some testimonies suggest that this is a Cherokee modification of a Yuchi word earlier.

18106,41,tennessee,18106,"Tennessee is known as The Volunteer State, a nickname that some claimed to have won during the War of 1812 because of the important role played by volunteer soldiers from Tennessee, especially during the Battle of New Orleans."
18107,41,tennessee,18107," Other sources differ as to the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to volunteers for the war between Mexico and America from 1846 to 1848."
18108,41,tennessee,18108," This explanation is more likely, because President Polk's call for 2,600 national volunteers at the beginning of the Mexico-America war resulted in only 30,000 Tennessee volunteers, largely in response to Davy Crockett's death and the appeals of former Tennessee governor, and then Texas politician Sam Houston."

18167,41,tennessee,18167," Athletes and visitors are attracted to Reelfoot Lake, originally formed by the earthquakes of 1811–12; the stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, as well as the lotus bed that covers the shallow waters, give the lake a strange beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168," Most of the condition has a wet subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher altitudes in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a temperate or humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee climate, with southern winds accounting for most of the annual rainfall in the state."

18178,41,tennessee,18178," Although the state is far enough from the coast to avoid any direct impact of a hurricane, the state location makes it likely to be affected by remnants of tropical cyclones that weaken on land and can cause significant precipitation, such as tropical storm Chris in 1982 and hurricane Opal in 1995."

18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the region between the first colony and the time of European contact were unknown, but several distinct cultural phases were named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC – 1000 BC) and Mississippi (1000–1600 BC), whose chiefs of staff were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee who lived in the Tennessee Valley before Cherokee's migration into river waters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first European excursions recorded in what is now known as Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559 and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo has registered the name ""Tanasqui"" of a local Indian village, which has evolved to the current state name."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,"At that time, Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi."
18197,41,tennessee,18197," Perhaps because of devastating European diseases the Indian tribes, which would have left a vacuum of population, and also because of the expansion of the European colony in the north, the Cherokee moved to the south of the region now called Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European settlers spread throughout the region, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all the Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw, and finally, the Cherokee in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British colony in today's Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near the current Vonore."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,"On that date, Fort Loudoun became the westernmost British outpost."
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard of Brahm and built by forces under British Captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202," After his completion, Captain Raymond Demeré abandoned command on 14 Aug. 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203,"War broke out between the British and the neighbour Overhill Cherokees, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with his surrender on 7 Aug. 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The following morning, Captain Paul Demeré and several of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of the Eastern and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began arriving late in the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,"The majority of 18th-century settlers were English or mainly English, but almost 20% were also Scottish-Irish."
18207,41,tennessee,18207," These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on land leased to the Cherokee people."
18208,41,tennessee,18208," During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycomore Shoals (now Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his belligerent faction of Cherokee, who were aligned with the British loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209, These Cherokee renegats were designated by the colonists as Chickamauga.
18210,41,tennessee,18210, They opposed the annexation by North Carolina of the Washington district and the simultaneous establishment of the Transylvanian colony further north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The life of many settlers was spared from the first war attacks by the warnings of Nancy Ward, the cousin of Dragging Canoe."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The border fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a gathering place in 1780 for Overmountain's men to hike over the Appalachian Mountains, engage and defeat the British army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213, Three counties in the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) left North Carolina in 1784 and formed Franklin State.
18214,41,tennessee,18214," Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (now eight) joined North Carolina in 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized in the southwestern territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In an effort to encourage settlers to move westward into the new territory, in 1787, the mother state of North Carolina ordered a road to cut to take settlers to the Cumberland colonies – from the south end of Mount Clinch (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Avery Trace"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Wilderness Road"" through the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,Tennessee was admitted to the Union on 1 June 1796 as 16th State.
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It was the first state created from a territory under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government.
18220,41,tennessee,18220," Apart from the 13 former colonies, only Vermont and Kentucky preceded the establishment of the state of Tennessee, and neither was ever a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, article I, section 31, stipulates that the starting point for the identification of the boundary is the extreme height of the stone mountain, at the point where the Virginia line intersects it, and leads essentially the extreme heights of the mountain ranges through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee after the Amerindian cities of Cowee and Old Chota, from thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (mount Unicoi) to the southern boundary of the State; all the territory, land and waters to the west of the said line are included within the limits and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also specified that the boundaries and jurisdiction of the State would include the future acquisition of land, reference to possible land exchanges with other States, or the acquisition of territory west of the Mississippi River."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As other white settlers settled in Tennessee, they entered into conflict with the Amerindian tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224," During the administration of U.S. President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."
18225,41,tennessee,18225,"American troops forced them to walk from ""emigration depots"" in eastern Tennessee, such as Fort Cass, to Indian territory further west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma."
18226,41,tennessee,18226," During this relocation, about 4,000 Cherokees died along the way westward."
18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi, ""the path where we screamed""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Amerindians forced to emigrate as a result of U.S. Indian abduction efforts, so the expression ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indians, particularly among the ""Five Civilized Tribes."""
18229,41,tennessee,18229, This sentence arose from a description of the previous emigration of the Choctaw Nation.
18230,41,tennessee,18230,"In February 1861 secessionists of the Tennessee government, led by Governor Isham Harris, asked for approval of an agreement to break ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a margin of 54-46%."
18231,41,tennessee,18231,"The strongest opposition to secession came from the Eastern Tennessee, which later attempted to form a separate State aligned with the Union."
18232,41,tennessee,18232," Following the confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's appeal for Tennessee and other states in response, Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization, submitted a secession order to the General Assembly and made direct openings to the confederate government."
18233,41,tennessee,18233,"On 7 May 1861, the Parliament of Tennessee ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States."
18234,41,tennessee,18234,"On 8 June 1861, when the inhabitants of the middle Tennessee had changed their position considerably, voters approved a second referendum calling for secession, thus becoming the last state to do so."
18235,41,tennessee,18235,"But Scott's state, supported by the Union, was also created at that time, and remained a de facto enclave of the United States throughout the war."

18470,41,tennessee,18470,"The first was adopted in 1796, the year Tennessee joined the Union, and the second was adopted in 1834."
18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution prohibited martial law under its jurisdiction.
18472,41,tennessee,18472, This may be the result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by the U.S. government's (North) Union forces after the American civil war.
18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee's policy, like that of most American states, is dominated by republican and democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474," Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state up to the period of the American civil war; for decades, a third east of the state was strongly republican and two thirds Western voted mostly democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475," This division was linked to the structure of the State in the areas of agriculture, plantations and slavery."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern section was made up of Yemeni farmers, but the middle and western Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton, which depended on slave labour."

18478,41,tennessee,18478," During the reconstruction, free men and former free-coloured people were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party."
18479,41,tennessee,18479, Many African-Americans were elected to local offices and some to state offices.
18480,41,tennessee,18480," After the reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have a competitive party policy, but in the 1880s the White-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed an electoral tax on voter registration."
18481,41,tennessee,18481," These were used to deprive most African Americans, and their power in state and local politics was significantly reduced."
18482,41,tennessee,18482,"In 1900, African-Americans accounted for 23.8% of the state's population, concentrated in the Middle Tennessee and West."
18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the State Legislative Assembly approved a form of city committee government on the basis of a broad vote for a few positions in a committee council; several cities adopted this as another means of limiting African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,"In 1913, the state legislature passed a bill allowing cities to adopt the structure without legislative approval."
18485,41,tennessee,18485," After the abandonment of the blacks' right to vote, the Republican Party in Tennessee became a predominantly white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, with the exception of two republican landslides at the national level of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee strongly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio governor James Cox, and in 1928, when he voted more resolutely for Herbert Hoover over New York governor Al Smith), the state was part of the solid democratic South until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In this post-war decade, he twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during the Second World War."
18488,41,tennessee,18488," Since then, more state voters have turned to support for Republicans, and candidates for the democratic presidency have only worn Tennessee four times."
18489,41,tennessee,18489,"In 1960, African Americans accounted for 16.45% of the population of the state."
18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was only after the mid-1960s and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new mechanisms, such as the Municipal Main Committee Governments, were adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491, Former government.
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former U.S. senator Bill Brock won in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among the Whites for state-wide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493,Tennessee has chosen governors from various parties since 1970.
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"At the beginning of the 21st century, Republican voters controlled most of the state, especially in rural and suburban areas outside cities; the democratic force was mainly confined to the urban core of the four major cities, and was particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter region comprises a large African-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496," Historically, the Republicans had their greatest strength in Eastern Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"The 1st and 2nd districts of Tennessee, based respectively in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, are among the few historically republican districts in the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498, Residents of these districts supported the Union over Confederation during the civil war.
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first one has been in Republican hands permanently since 1881, and the Republicans (or their predecessors) have held it for all, except four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The second was permanently held by the Republicans or their predecessors since 1859.
18501,41,tennessee,18501,"In the 2000 presidential election, Vice-President Al Gore, a United States democrat"
18502,41,tennessee,18502," Senator of Tennessee, did not bear his original state, an unusual but revealing event of the strengthening of Republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503," Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, with his margin of victory in the state rising from 4% in 2000 to 14% in 2004."
18504,41,tennessee,18504," Candidates for the democratic presidency of southern states, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, are generally better off than their North Tennessee counterparts, especially among voters split outside metropolitan areas."

18506,41,tennessee,18506,Lieutenant-Governor Ron Ramsey is the first Republican Speaker of the Senate in 140 years.
18507,41,tennessee,18507,"In the 2008 elections, the Republican Party took control of the two chambers of the Tennessee Legislative Assembly for the first time since the reconstruction."
18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, approximately 30 per cent of state voters identified themselves as independent."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"Baker v. Carr (1962) of the United States Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one vote"", requiring that state legislatures redistribute the distribution of Congress according to the decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,It also requires that both chambers of state legislatures be population-based to be represented rather than geographical districts such as counties.
18511,41,tennessee,18511, This case was the result of a legal action which challenged the long-standing rural bias in the distribution of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512," After decades of under-representation of urban populations in many state legislatures, this important decision has led to increased (and proportional) importance in the policy of the State by cities and, eventually, the suburbs, legislators and State officials in relation to their population within the State."
18513,41,tennessee,18513," This decision also applied to many other states that had long been under the control of rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont and Montana."
18514,41,tennessee,18514,"The State of Tennessee has four law enforcement entities: the Tennessee Road Patrol, the Tennessee Wildlife Agency, the Tennessee Investigation Bureau and the Tennessee Environment and Conservation Department."

18519,41,tennessee,18519,Local law enforcement is divided between county sheriff's offices and municipal police services.
18520,41,tennessee,18520,The Tennessee Constitution requires every county to have an elected sheriff.
18521,41,tennessee,18521,"In 94 of the 95 counties, the sheriff is the county chief of law enforcement and has jurisdiction over the entire county."
18522,41,tennessee,18522," Each Sheriff's Office is responsible for the service of warrants, court security, prison operations and primary law enforcement in unincorporated areas of a county, as well as support to municipal police services."
18523,41,tennessee,18523,Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police service to provide police services within the limits of their organization.
18524,41,tennessee,18524,The three counties of Tennessee to adopt metropolitan governments have adopted different approaches to resolving the conflict that a metropolitan government presents with the requirement to have an elected sheriff.

18526,41,tennessee,18526,The carrying and opening of a handgun are permitted with a Tennessee weapon licence or an equivalent alternative condition permit.
18527,41,tennessee,18527," Effective July 1, 2014, a licence is no longer required to possess a handgun loaded in a motor vehicle."
18528,41,tennessee,18528,The death penalty exists in Tennessee at different times since the establishment of the State.
18529,41,tennessee,18529," Before 1913, the mode of execution was suspended."
18530,41,tennessee,18530," From 1913 to 1915, there was an interruption of executions, but they were restored in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531," From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (Furman v. Georgia) that capital punishment was unconstitutional, there were no other executions."
18532,41,tennessee,18532,"The death penalty resumed in 1978, although detainees awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 were for the most part sentenced to life imprisonment."
18533,41,tennessee,18533," From 1916 to 1960, the state executed 125 prisoners."

18536,41,tennessee,18536,Tennessee has 59 prisoners on death row (October 2018).
18537,41,tennessee,18537,"The lethal injection was approved by Parliament in 1998, although those who were sentenced to death before 1 January 1999 could request electrocution."
18538,41,tennessee,18538,"In May 2014, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a law allowing the use of the electric chair for executions on death row when lethal injection drugs are not available."
18539,41,tennessee,18539,The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is the only Amerindian Indian tribe recognized by the federal government in the state.
18540,41,tennessee,18540,"It owns 79 acres (32 ha) in Henning, which was placed in a federal trust by the tribe in 2012."
18541,41,tennessee,18541,It is controlled directly by the tribe.

18595,42,texas,18595,"The entire cultural group, mainly centered in north-eastern Mexico, is now extinct."
18596,42,texas,18596,It is difficult to say who originally lived in the northwest part of the state.
18597,42,texas,18597,"At the time when the region came to be explored, it belonged to the well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztécan people who had turned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century."

18603,42,texas,18603," They were not particularly kind to their indigenous populations, let alone to the Caddoans, who had no confidence because their culture was divided between the Spanish and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604," When the Spaniards briefly succeeded in conquering the colony of Louisiana, they decided to change tactics and try to be extremely friends with the Indians, which they continued even after the French had taken over the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605, After the purchase of Louisiana in 1803 the United States inherited this strange circumstance.
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred the American company and almost all of their population migrated to the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spaniards felt shaken after spending so much time and effort and began trying to attract the Caddo, promising them even more land."
18608,42,texas,18608," Apparently, without knowing how they arrived, the United States (which had begun to convince the tribes to separate from the whites by selling everything and moving west since they won the Louisiana purchase) faced an overflow of indigenous peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced populations to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609," They included Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, among others, who had all come to see the Caddoans as saviors, making them very influential."

18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans have always been meaningless when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region have never been able to find any solid evidence linking them to it and often it was so far from Caddoan lands, it made little sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,"It seems very likely that these are false flag attacks aimed at triggering a cascade effect to force the indigenous people under Caddoan's influence to enter into an armed conflict without violating any treaty, preferably on the Spanish side."
18618,42,texas,18618," Although no evidence was found of the culprit's identity, Texas officials at the time tried several times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check."

18799,42,texas,18799,"The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas to the south."
18800,42,texas,18800,The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas in the north.
18801,42,texas,18801,The Sabine River is a natural border with Louisiana to the east.
18802,42,texas,18802,"Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a northern border with Oklahoma at 36° 30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso is located on the western tip of the state at 32° N and the Rio Grande."
18803,42,texas,18803," With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions, regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soil, topography, geology, precipitation, and plant and animal communities."
18804,42,texas,18804,"A classification system divides Texas, in the order of southeast to west, with respect to the Gulf coastal plains, the inland lowlands, the great plains, and the province of the basin and range."
18805,42,texas,18805,The Gulf Coast Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeastern part of the state.
18806,42,texas,18806,The vegetation in this area is thick pine wood.
18807,42,texas,18807,"The Low Inland Region consists of hilly, gently sloping forestland and is part of a larger pine and deciduous forest."
18808,42,texas,18808,The Crusader and Caprock Escarpment are part of the inland lowlands.
18809,42,texas,18809,The Great Plains region of central Texas crosses the panhandle of the state and Llano Estacado to the country of the state hills near Austin.
18810,42,texas,18810, This area is dominated by meadows and steppe.
18811,42,texas,18811,"""Far West Texas"" or ""Trans-Pecos"" is the province of the basin and state range."
18812,42,texas,18812,"The most varied of the regions, this area includes Sand Hills, Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, mountain wooded slopes, and desert meadows."
18813,42,texas,18813,"Texas has 3700 streams and 15 main rivers, the Rio Grande being the largest."
18814,42,texas,18814," Other important rivers include the Pecos, Brazos, Colorado and Red River."

18819,42,texas,18819,"Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, ending in the south against the folded Western Sierra Madre of Mexico."
18820,42,texas,18820,The continental crust forms a stable mesoproterozoic craton that transforms through a wide continental margin and a transition crust into a true oceanic crust in the Gulf of Mexico.
18821,42,texas,18821,"Texas's oldest rocks date from Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old."
18822,42,texas,18822," These igneous and metamorphic precambrian rocks underlie most of the state and are exposed in three locations: the Llano Uprising, Van Horn and Franklin Mountains, near El Paso."
18823,42,texas,18823,The sedimentary rocks cover most of these ancient rocks.
18824,42,texas,18824,"The oldest sediments were deposited on the sides of a torn continental margin, or passive margin that developed in Cambrian."
18825,42,texas,18825, This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided into the Pennsylvania subperiod to form Pangea.
18826,42,texas,18826, This is the buried ridge of the Appalachian Mountains – Pennsylvania Continental Collision Ouachita area.
18827,42,texas,18827, This orogenous ridge is today buried under the Dallas–Waco–Austin–San Antonio trend.
18828,42,texas,18828,The end of the Paleozoic mountains collapsed when the Jurassic began to open the Gulf of Mexico.
18829,42,texas,18829,"Pangea began to separate in the Triassic, but the seafloor extending to form the Gulf of Mexico only appeared in the middle and late Jurassic."
18830,42,texas,18830,The coastline has moved back to the eastern margin of the state and the passive margin of the Gulf of Mexico has begun to form.
18831,42,texas,18831," Today, 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediment are buried under the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of the remaining U.S. oil reserves are here."
18832,42,texas,18832,"At the beginning of its formation, the nascent basin of the Gulf of Mexico was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of the Jurassic era."
18833,42,texas,18833, These salt deposits form salt domes and are located in eastern Texas along the Gulf Coast.
18834,42,texas,18834,Outcrops in eastern Texas consist of cretaceous and paleogenic sediments that contain significant eocene lignite deposits.
18835,42,texas,18835,"The Mississippi and Pennsylvania sediments in the north; the Permian sediments in the west; and the Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast, and on the continental shelf of Texas contain oil."
18836,42,texas,18836,Volcanic oligocene rocks are found in the extreme west of Texas in the Big Bend area.
18837,42,texas,18837,An important aquifer is a Miocene sediment cover known as the Ogallala Formation in the Western High Plains region.
18838,42,texas,18838," Located away from an active plate tectonic border, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes."
18839,42,texas,18839,A great variety of animals and insects live in Texas.

18844,42,texas,18844," During the Johnson administration, the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, worked to draw attention to the wild flowers of Texas."
18845,42,texas,18845,The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of several climatic areas give the state very variable weather conditions.
18846,42,texas,18846,"The state Panhandle has cooler winters than northern Texas, while the Gulf coast has mild winters."
18847,42,texas,18847,Texas has large variations in precipitation regimes.
18848,42,texas,18848,"El Paso, at the western end of the state, averages 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual precipitation, while parts of southeastern Texas average 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year."
18849,42,texas,18849,Dallas in the North Central region has a more moderate average of 37 inches (940 mm) per year.
18850,42,texas,18850,"Snow falls several times every winter in the Panhandle and mountain areas of western Texas, once or twice a year in northern Texas, and once every few years in central and eastern Texas."
18851,42,texas,18851,Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only under rare circumstances.
18852,42,texas,18852,"It is worth noting the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm, where 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average temperature was 65°F in December."
18853,42,texas,18853," Maximum summer temperatures are on average 80°F (26°C) in the mountains of western Texas and on Galveston Island at approximately 100°F (38°C) in the Rio Grande Valley, but most regions of Texas have consistently high summer temperatures in the range of 90°F (32°C)."
18854,42,texas,18854, Morning temperatures in the summer range from 50 °F (14 °C) in the western Texas mountains to 80 °F (27 °C) in Galveston.
18855,42,texas,18855,The table below shows the averages for August (usually the warmest month) and January (usually the coldest) in some cities in different regions of the state.
18856,42,texas,18856," Storms often hit Texas, especially the eastern and northern parts of the state."
18857,42,texas,18857,The tornado alley covers the northern part of Texas.
18858,42,texas,18858,"The state is experiencing the most tornadoes in the United States, with an average of 139 tornadoes per year."
18859,42,texas,18859, They most often strike in northern Texas and the Panhandle.
18860,42,texas,18860," tornadoes generally occur in Texas during the months of April, May and June."
18861,42,texas,18861, Some of the most destructive hurricanes in American history have hit Texas.
18862,42,texas,18862,"A hurricane in 1875 killed approximately 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the city."
18863,42,texas,18863, These events allowed Galveston to take over as the main port city.
18864,42,texas,18864," Hurricane Galveston of 1900 then devastated this city, killing approximately 8,000 people or perhaps up to 12,000 people."
18865,42,texas,18865, That makes it the most deadly natural disaster in American history.
18866,42,texas,18866,"In 2017, Hurricane Harvey fell in Rockport as a Category 4 hurricane causing significant damage to the site."
18867,42,texas,18867,"The storm lasted a long time, allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain in the Greater Houston area and the surrounding counties."
18868,42,texas,18868,The result has been widespread and catastrophic floods that have flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.
18869,42,texas,18869,"Harvey eventually became the most costly hurricane in the world, causing damage estimated at $198.6 billion, exceeding the cost of Hurricane Katrina."
18870,42,texas,18870," Other devastating hurricanes in Texas include Hurricane Galveston of 1915, Hurricane Audrey of 1957, which killed more than 600 people, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008."

18872,42,texas,18872,"In 2017, Texas emits the most greenhouse gases in the U.S. nearly twice as much as California, the second most polluting state.In 2017, the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tonnes) of carbon dioxide per year."
18873,42,texas,18873,"As an independent nation, Texas is the world's seventh largest producer of greenhouse gases."
18874,42,texas,18874, Among the causes of the government's large greenhouse gas emissions are the large number of coal-fired power plants and the government's refining and manufacturing industries.
18875,42,texas,18875,"In 2010, there were 2,553 ""emission events"" that contributed 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tons) of contaminants to the Texas sky."

18883,42,texas,18883,"The 160,000-square-kilometre (160,000 km2) area is home to most of the largest cities and metropolitan areas of the state, as well as 17 million people, representing almost 75 per cent of the total population of Texas."
18884,42,texas,18884, Houston and Dallas were recognized as world cities.
18885,42,texas,18885, These cities are distributed within the State.
18886,42,texas,18886," Unlike cities, unincorporated rural settlements, known as colonias, often lack basic infrastructure and are characterized by poverty."
18887,42,texas,18887,"The Texas Attorney General's Office reported in 2011 that Texas had approximately 2,294 colonias and estimated that about 500,000 people lived in colonias."

19844,44,vermont,19844," About 500 million years ago, the Vermont was part of Laurentia and was located in the tropics."
19845,44,vermont,19845,"Green Mountain's central and southern range includes the oldest Vermont rocks, formed about a billion years ago during the first period of mountain (or orogeny) construction."
19846,44,vermont,19846," Subsequently, approximately 400 million years ago, the second period of mountain construction created Green Mountain peaks of 15,000 to 20,000 feet (4,600 to 6,100 m), three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas."
19847,44,vermont,19847,"The geological pressures that created these peaks remain evident as Thrust Champlain, current from north to south to west of the mountains (now the east bank of Lake Champlain)."
19848,44,vermont,19848, This is an example of a geological fault surge where the bedrock is pushed on the formation of more recent rocks.
19849,44,vermont,19849," Due to the tectonic formation, Vermont to the east of the green mountains tends to form from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods, and western Vermont mainly from the older Precambrian and Cambrian material."

21064,46,washington,21064,"The frequent rain and cloud cover of western Washington is a major plotting point in the popular Twilight book, which is located in western Washington precisely because of its relative lack of sun."
21065,46,washington,21065,"East Washington – the eastern part of the state of the Cascades – has a relatively dry climate, which contrasts sharply with the west side."
21066,46,washington,21066,It includes large semi-arid steppe zones and some really arid deserts in the rain shadow of the Cascades
21067,46,washington,21067," Despite limited rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important activity in much of eastern Washington, because the soil is very productive and irrigation, supported by dams along the Columbia River, is quite widespread."
21068,46,washington,21068,"The spread of the population in eastern Washington State is dominated by access to water, particularly to rivers."
21069,46,washington,21069,"The main cities are all located next to the rivers or lakes, most of which are named after the river or lake they adhere to."
21070,46,washington,21070,"More to the east, the climate becomes less arid, with annual precipitation increasing as we go east to 21.2 inches (540 mm) at Pullman, near the Washington-Idaho border."
21071,46,washington,21071,The Okanogan Highlands and Kettle River Range and Selkirk Mountains cover much of the northeastern quadrant of the state.

21073,46,washington,21073,"As discussed above, Washington's climate varies greatly from west to east."
21074,46,washington,21074,"A Mediterranean climate prevails in western Washington, and a much drier semi-arid climate prevails east of the Cascade Range."
21075,46,washington,21075,"Major factors that determine Washington's climate include the large, high-pressure, low-pressure, semi-permanent systems in the northern Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In the spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the northern Pacific Ocean, causing a clockwise spiral of air."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means that the prevailing northwestern winds bring relatively fresh air and a predictable drought season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In autumn and winter, a system of low-pressure cyclones takes over in the northern Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,The inward spiral air in the opposite direction of the clockwise makes the prevailing winds of Washington come from the southwest and brings relatively warm and humid air masses and a predictable wet season.
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is commonly used to describe events in the atmospheric river, where repeated storm systems are driven by this persistent cyclone in the tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions of the Pacific Northwest."
21081,46,washington,21081," Although the west of Washington has a marine climate similar to many coastal cities in Europe, there are exceptions such as the ""Big Snow"" events of 1880, 1881, 1893 and 1916, and the ""Deep Freezing"" winters of 1883–84, 1915–1916, 1949–1950 and 1955–1956, among others."
21082,46,washington,21082," During these events, western Washington experienced up to 1.8 metres of snow, subzero temperatures (−18 °C), three months of snow on the ground, and frozen lakes and rivers for weeks."
21083,46,washington,21083,"The lowest officially recorded temperature in Seattle is 0°F (−18°C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-lying areas at about three hours from Seattle recorded low temperatures as cold as -48°F (−44°C)."
21084,46,washington,21084,The oscillation of the South greatly influences the weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085," During the El Niño phase, the jet enters the United States further south through California, so late autumn and winter are drier than normal with less snow."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet across the northwest Pacific, which means that Washington has more rain and snow than average."
21087,46,washington,21087,"In 2006, the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group published The Impacts of Climate Change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities presented in view of the possibility of rising global temperatures and their effects on the state of Washington."

21089,46,washington,21089,"The western part of the Olympic Peninsula receives up to 160 inches (4,100 mm) of precipitation each year, making it the wettest area of the 48 conjunctural states and a temperate rainforest."
21090,46,washington,21090,Weeks can go by without a clear day.
21091,46,washington,21091,"The west slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the largest annual snowfalls (in some locations, more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres of water equivalent) in the country."
21092,46,washington,21092,"In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093, Precipitation then increases eastward toward the Rocky Mountains (approximately 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and waterfalls aggravate this climate pattern by causing an orographical uplift of blowing air masses inside the Pacific Ocean, resulting in high precipitation levels on the wind side of the mountains and low levels on the left side."
21095,46,washington,21095, This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic mountains and the Cascade chain.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases, the wind slopes facing the southwest receive high precipitation and mild and cool temperatures."
21097,46,washington,21097," While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for cloud and rain in winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher altitudes."
21098,46,washington,21098,"Mount Baker, near the northern border of the state, is one of the most snowy areas in the world."
21099,46,washington,21099,"In 1999, he set the world record for snowfall in a single season: 1,140 inches (95 ft.; 29 m.)."
21100,46,washington,21100,"To the east of the Cascades, a large area suffers from heavy rain effects."
21101,46,washington,21101," Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington State, with the strongest effects of rain shadow at relatively low elevations on the central Columbia Plateau, particularly in the area just east of the Columbia River, from the Snake River to the Okanagan Highland."
21102,46,washington,21102," Thus, instead of rainforests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry grassland, shrub steppe and sand dunes."
21103,46,washington,21103,The mean annual temperature ranges from 51°F (11°C) on the Pacific coast to 40°F (4°C) in the northeast.
21104,46,washington,21104,The lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48 °F (−44 °C) in Winthrop and Mazama.

21106,46,washington,21106, Both recordings were made east of the Cascades.
21107,46,washington,21107,"Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, long winter drizzles and warm temperate summers."
21108,46,washington,21108,"The eastern region, which does not enjoy the general moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean, sometimes has an extreme climate."
21109,46,washington,21109, Cold Arctic fronts in winter and heat waves in summer are not rare.
21110,46,washington,21110,"In the western region, temperatures were only 107°F (42°C) in Centralia and up to -6°F (−21°C) in Longview."
21111,46,washington,21111,"The forests cover about half of the area of the state, mainly west of the Northern Cascades."
21112,46,washington,21112," Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forest area is owned by the state, 64 per cent of which is federal."
21113,46,washington,21113,"Common trees and plants in the area are camassia, Douglas-fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many ferns."
21114,46,washington,21114,"The various wild areas of the state offer a sanctuary, with large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals."
21115,46,washington,21115,"The shores of the Pacific surrounding the San Juan Islands are heavily populated by white-headed, grey and humpback whales."
21116,46,washington,21116,"In East Washington, the flora is very different."
21117,46,washington,21117,Tumbleweeds and sage dominate the landscape in large parts of the country.
21118,46,washington,21118," Russian olive trees and other trees are common on the banks of rivers; however, apart from the banks of rivers, huge stretches of eastern Washington have no natural trees at all (although many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course)."
21119,46,washington,21119, There is a greater variety of flora in both the blue mountains and the eastern Cascades.
21120,46,washington,21120," Native mammals of the state include bat, black bear, bobcat, cougar, coyote, deer, elk, grey wolf, hare, moose, mountain beaver, muskrat, opossum, pocket gopher, rabbit, raccoon, river otter, snout and squirrel."
21121,46,washington,21121," Because of the breadth of geography, the state of Washington is home to several different ecoregions, which allow for a variety of bird species."
21122,46,washington,21122," This range includes raptors, shorebirds, forest birds, prairie birds, ducks, and others."
21123,46,washington,21123," There were also a large number of species introduced in Washington, dating back to the early 18th century, including horses and burros."

21444,47,west_virginia,21444,"A century later, the area now identified as Western Virginia was also contested by the Anglo-Americans, the colonies of Pennsylvania and Virginia claiming territorial rights under their colonial charters to that region before the American Revolutionary War."
21445,47,west_virginia,21445," Some speculative land companies, such as Vandalia Company, and later Ohio Company and Indiana Company, attempted to legitimize their land claims in parts of West Virginia and today Kentucky, but failed."
21446,47,west_virginia,21446, This rivalry has led some settlers to ask the Continental Congress to create a new territory called Westsylvania.

21450,47,west_virginia,21450," Its inhabitants were dissatisfied for years with their position in Virginia, the government being dominated by the elite planters in the Tidewater and Piedmont regions."
21451,47,west_virginia,21451,"The Legislative Assembly had electoral malfeasances, based on the counting of slaves to the regional populations, and white residents of the West were under-represented in the State Legislative Assembly."
21452,47,west_virginia,21452,"Subsistence farmers and Yemeni farmers lived in the west and were generally less in favour of slavery, although many counties were divided on their support."
21453,47,west_virginia,21453,The inhabitants of this region became more strongly divided after the elite planters of eastern Virginia voted for secession of the Union during the civil war.
21454,47,west_virginia,21454,"The residents of the western and northern counties established a separate government under Francis Pierpont in 1861, which they called the restored government."

21458,47,west_virginia,21458,"The history of West Virginia has been deeply affected by its mountainous terrain, its many vast river valleys and its rich natural resources."
21459,47,west_virginia,21459,"All these factors are at the origin of its economy and the way of life of its inhabitants, who tend to live in many small, relatively isolated communities in the mountain valleys."
21460,47,west_virginia,21460,An analysis of a local stalagmite in 2010 revealed that Amerindians burned forests to clear the land as early as 100 B.C.
21461,47,west_virginia,21461," Some regional tribes of the Eastern Woodlands, which were late prehistoric, were more engaged in hunting and fishing, using the method of gardening of the Eastern Agricultural Complex, which used fire to eliminate undergrowth in some areas."

21467,47,west_virginia,21467,"The local Indians made corn bread and a flat rye bread called ""bannock"" as they emerged from the protohistoric era."
21468,47,west_virginia,21468,A horizon that extends a little before the beginning of the eighteenth century is sometimes called the acculturating culture of the Fireside Cabin.
21469,47,west_virginia,21469,Trade posts were established by European traders along the Potomac and James rivers.
21470,47,west_virginia,21470,"The tribes that inhabited West Virginia from 1600 were the Siouan Monongahela culture to the north, the Fort Antique culture along the Ohio River from Monongahela to Kentucky and extending an unknown distance inland, and the Siouan Tutelo and Moneton tribes to the east."
21471,47,west_virginia,21471," There was also the Iroquoian Susquehannock in the area approximately east of the Monongahela River and north of the Monongahela National Forest, a possible tribe called the Senatorndoa, or Shenandoah, in the Shenandoah Valley and perhaps the easternmost point of the State was the home of the Manahoac people."
21472,47,west_virginia,21472,"The Monongahelas may have been the same as a people known as Calicua, or Cali."
21473,47,west_virginia,21473," Perhaps the following was the same tribe: Moneton, Moheton, Senatorndoa, Tomahitan."
21474,47,west_virginia,21474," During the Beaver Wars, other tribes settled in the area."
21475,47,west_virginia,21475," There were the Iroquoians Tiontatecaga (also Little Mingo, Guyandotte), who seem to have separated from the Petun after being defeated by the Iroquois."
21476,47,west_virginia,21476, They eventually moved somewhere between the Kanawha and Little Kanawha rivers.
21477,47,west_virginia,21477,"In the 1750s, when the Mingo Senatorca seceded from the Iroquois and returned to the Ohio River Valley, they argued that this tribe had merged with them."
21478,47,west_virginia,21478,"The Shawnee also arrived, but were mainly stationed in the former Monongahela territory around 1750, but they extended their influence throughout the Ohio area."

21480,47,west_virginia,21480,"The Erie, which were driven out of Ohio around 1655, are now considered the same as the Westo, which invaded to South Carolina before being destroyed in the 1680s."

21482,47,west_virginia,21482,"The historical movement of the Tutelo, as well as the carbon dates for the Ancient Forts, seem to correspond to the given period of 1655–70 as the time of their removal."
21483,47,west_virginia,21483,"The Susquehannocks were the first participants in the Beaver Wars, but they were cut off from Ohio by the Iroquois around 1630 and found themselves in terrible straits."
21484,47,west_virginia,21484," From illness to constant war and inability to provide for their financial needs, they began to collapse and settle increasingly to the east, to the Susquehanna River in eastern Pennsylvania."

21486,47,west_virginia,21486,"The Siwan tribes settled in North Carolina and later returned as a tribe, known as the Blackfoot of the East, or Christannas."
21487,47,west_virginia,21487,The Westo did not secure the territory that they conquered.
21488,47,west_virginia,21488," Before they even left, the displaced indigenous people from the south flooded into newly conquered areas and took care of them."
21489,47,west_virginia,21489," These became known as Shattaras, or West Virginia Cherokees."
21490,47,west_virginia,21490," They accepted and merged with the Monetons, who began to name themselves as the Mohetons."
21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicua also began to designate themselves as Cherokees shortly after, showing an apparent new fusion."
21492,47,west_virginia,21492, These Shattaras were closely related to the tribes that formed in the south following the Westo – the Yuchi and Cherokee.
21493,47,west_virginia,21493," From 1715 to 1717, the Yamasee War broke out."
21494,47,west_virginia,21494,The senator allegedly took sides for the Yuchi and was reportedly destroyed by Yamasee's allies.
21495,47,west_virginia,21495," Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, it would mean the collapse of the Shattara-Moneton culture."
21496,47,west_virginia,21496," Another tribe that appeared in the area was the Canaragay, or Kanawha."
21497,47,west_virginia,21497," Later, they moved to Maryland and merged into colonial culture."

21500,47,west_virginia,21500," According to some sources, the Knights of Governor Alexander Spotswood's Golden Horseshoe Expedition in 1716 (for which the state named Golden Horseshoe Competition for 8th grades) had entered Pendleton County; however, modern historians interpret the original accounts of the trip as suggesting that none of the expedition's riders ventured much more west of the Blue Ridge Mountains than Harrisonburg, Virginia."
21501,47,west_virginia,21501,"John Van Metre, an Indian merchant, entered the north in 1725."

21503,47,west_virginia,21503,"King Charles II of England, in 1661, granted a company of gentlemen of the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, known as Neck Nord."

21505,47,west_virginia,21505,A considerable portion of this land was surveyed by young George Washington between 1748 and 1751.

21509,47,west_virginia,21509," Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, although they were hindered by Amerindian resistance."
21510,47,west_virginia,21510," Few Amerindians lived permanently within the present state boundaries, but the area was a common hunting ground, traversed by many trails."
21511,47,west_virginia,21511," During the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe), the French Indian allies almost destroyed the scattered British colonies."
21512,47,west_virginia,21512," Shortly before the American Revolutionary War in 1774, the Governor of the Crown of Virginia John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, led a force on the mountains."
21513,47,west_virginia,21513,"A corps of militiamen under Colonel Andrew Lewis treated the Shawnee Indians under Hokoleskwa (or ""Cornstalk""), a crushing blow during the Battle of Point Pleasant at the junction of the Kanawha and Ohio rivers."
21514,47,west_virginia,21514,"At the Treaty of Camp Charlotte concluding the Dunmore War, Cornstalk agreed to recognize the Ohio River as the new border with the ""Long Knives""."
21515,47,west_virginia,21515,"In 1776, however, the Shawnee returned to war, joining the Chickamauga, a band of Cherokee known for the area where they lived."
21516,47,west_virginia,21516,The Amerindian attacks on settlers continued until after the American Revolutionary War.
21517,47,west_virginia,21517," During the war, settlers from western Virginia were generally active Whigs and many were serving in the Continental Army."
21518,47,west_virginia,21518," However, the Claypool rebellion of 1780–81, in which a group of men refused to pay the taxes imposed by the Continental Army, demonstrated the rigor of the war in what became Western Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,The social conditions in western Virginia were quite different from those in the eastern part of the state.
21520,47,west_virginia,21520,"The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable portion of immigration came through Pennsylvania and included Germans, Scottish-Irish Protestants, and settlers from more northerly states."
21521,47,west_virginia,21521,The eastern and southern counties were primarily established by the eastern Virginians.
21522,47,west_virginia,21522," During the American Revolution, the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was submitted to Congress, on the grounds that the mountains had an almost impassable barrier to the east."
21523,47,west_virginia,21523,"The wilderness of the country makes slavery unprofitable, and time only increases the social, political, economic and cultural differences (see Tuckahoe-Cohee) between the two sections of Virginia."
21524,47,west_virginia,21524,"In 1829, a constitutional convention was convened in Richmond to examine the reforms of the obsolete constitution of Virginia."
21525,47,west_virginia,21525,Philip Doddridge of Brooke County defended the cause of the West Virginians seeking a more democratic framework of government.
21526,47,west_virginia,21526," However, Western reforms have been rejected by the leaders of the eastern Alleghenies who ""dive into political power in an effort to preserve their way of life as a plantation dependent on the slavery of the Blacks""."
21527,47,west_virginia,21527, Virginia's leaders maintained a property qualification to effectively deny the right to vote to poor farmers in the West whose families were engaged in much of the agricultural work themselves.
21528,47,west_virginia,21528,"In addition, the 1829–30 convention granted to the counties that held slaves the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population by allocating state representation in the House of Representatives of the United States."
21529,47,west_virginia,21529,"As a result, all but one of the counties west of the Alleghenies voted to reject the constitution, which was nonetheless adopted because of the support of the East."
21530,47,west_virginia,21530,The failure of the Eastern Planters' elite to carry out constitutional reforms exacerbated the East-West sectarianism existing in Virginia and contributed to the subsequent division of Virginia.
21531,47,west_virginia,21531,"The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850-1951, the Reform Convention, addresses a number of issues of importance to Western Virginians."

21535,47,west_virginia,21535," Representation in the Chamber of Delegates was distributed on the basis of the 1850 census, with only the whites."
21536,47,west_virginia,21536,"The representation of Senators has been arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats, with the West receiving twenty and the East thirty senators."
21537,47,west_virginia,21537," This was made acceptable to the West by a provision which required the General Assembly to resume representation on the basis of the white population in 1865, or to refer the matter to a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the East has also given itself a tax advantage by requiring a real and real property tax, except for slaves."
21539,47,west_virginia,21539," Slaves under the age of 12 were not taxed and slaves over that age were only taxed at $300, a fraction of their real value."
21540,47,west_virginia,21540," However, small-scale farmers had all their property, animals and land taxed at full value."
21541,47,west_virginia,21541," Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the West, the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542," Most of the opposition came from delegates from the eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the West."
21543,47,west_virginia,21543,"In view of these differences, many in the West had long considered a separate state."
21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men such as attorney Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont had long fought under the political domination of the slaves of Tidewater and Piedmont."
21545,47,west_virginia,21545,"In addition to the differences regarding the abolition of slavery, he and his allies felt the government of Virginia ignored and refused to spend money on the necessary internal improvements in the West, such as spindles and railways."
21546,47,west_virginia,21546,West Virginia is the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate State (Virginia) during the American Civil War.
21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the 1861 Virginia Secession Agreement voted for the secession of the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwest corner (who eventually became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favour of the secession order, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548," Almost immediately after this vote, a mass meeting in Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet at Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"At this first meeting, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, but more than a third of the delegates were from the North Panhandle region."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550, Soon there was a division of feeling.
21551,47,west_virginia,21551," Some delegates led by John S. Carlile favoured the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been adopted by the required referendum (as happened on 23 May), this action would constitute a revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if the Virginians adopted the secession order (of which there was no doubt), another convention including the elected members of the legislature would meet at Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On May 23, 1861, the secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the order."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on 11 June and stated that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its acts were null and void and all those who had acceded to it had left their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never actually elected by public vote to act on behalf of Western Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of the 103 members, 33 were elected to the Virginia General Assembly on 23 May."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557," These included United States senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and senators who had left their offices to meet at Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558," Other members ""were chosen in an even more irregular way – some at mass meetings, others by county committee and others were apparently appointed by themselves""."
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,A law on the reorganization of the Government was passed on 19 June.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The delegates of the next day's assembly chose Francis H. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, and elected other officers to a rival state government and two U.S. senators (Willy and Carlile) to replace the secessionists before adjourning."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,"The federal government in Washington, D.C. quickly recognized the new government and sat on both new senators."
21562,47,west_virginia,21562, Thus there were two state governments in Virginia: one promising allegiance to the United States and the other to Confederation.
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The second Wheeling Convention had been suspended until 6 August, then met on 20 August and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and a convention to regulate a constitution if the vote were to be in favour."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"In the elections of 24 October 1861, 18,408 votes were cast for the new State and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The results of the elections were called into question, since the Union army then occupied the area and the Union troops were stationed in numerous polls to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"It was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in confederate soldiers' camps, which elected rival state officials such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567, Most pro-state votes came from 16 counties around the North Panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"More than 50,000 votes were cast on the secession order, but the vote on state status did not exceed 19,000 votes."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, where Wheeling is located, only a quarter of the registered voters voted."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become Western Virginia, there was no vote at all, since two thirds of West Virginia's territory had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,Votes in the counties in favour of secession were mainly cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572," Despite this controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to draft a new Constitution for the new State, beginning on 26 November 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573," During this constitutional convention, one Mr. Lamb from Ohio County and one Mr. Carskadon claimed that, in Hampshire County, out of only 195 votes, 39 were expressed by state citizens; the others were presented illegally by Union soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One key figure was Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools, as well as to limit the slave movement in the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The proposal for education was successful, but the convention tabled the proposals for slavery before completing its work on 18 February 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution is more inspired by Ohio than Virginia, adopting a cantonal government model rather than Virginia's ""courthouse clicks"" than Carlile criticizes, and a compromise required by the Kanawha area (lawyers Charleston Benjamin Smith and Brown) allows counties and municipalities to vote for subsidies for railways or other improvement agencies."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578," This instrument was ratified (18,162 in favour and 514 against) on 11 April 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,"On May 13, 1862, the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state."
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,A request for admission to the Union was made to Congress by Senator Waitman Willey of the restored government of Virginia.
21581,47,west_virginia,21581," However, Senator Carlile sought to sabotage the bill by first trying to expand the borders of the new state to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then defeating the Willey amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling law was approved by President Abraham Lincoln, who admitted West Virginia, on the condition that a provision for the progressive abolition of slavery be included in its constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle had urged in the Wheeling Intelligencer and also wrote to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584," While many felt that West Virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln expressed his opinion on the admission of West Virginia by concluding that ""the organ that consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Legislative Assembly of Virginia"" and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and timely."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,"The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the request for the abolition of the enabling federal legislation was met."
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,"The revised Constitution was adopted on 26 March 1863, and on 20 April 1863 President Lincoln issued a proclamation in which he admitted the state 60 days later, on 20 June 1863."
21587,47,west_virginia,21587," Meanwhile, officers for the new state were selected, while the Gov."
21588,47,west_virginia,21588,"Pierpont moved its pro-Union capital Virginia to Alexandria occupied by the Union, where he affirmed and exercised jurisdiction over all the remaining counties of Virginia in the federal lines."
21589,47,west_virginia,21589,The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was then brought before the United States Supreme Court in Virginia v. West Virginia.
21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties, located on the Potomac to the east of the mountains, in 1863, with the agreement of the reorganized Virginia government, voted in favour of annexation to Western Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591, Many electors in counties strongly in favour of secession were absent from the Confederate Army at the time of the vote and refused to recognize the transfer upon their return.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly repealed the act of secession and, in 1866, brought an action against West Virginia by asking the court to declare the counties part of Virginia, which would have declared the admission of West Virginia as an unconstitutional state."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593," Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress adopted a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Western Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595," During the civil war, General Union forces George B. McClellan took possession of most of the territory during the summer of 1861, culminating in the Battle of Rich Mountain, and control of the Union was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863, General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 confederates, raided a considerable part of the state and burned the Pierpont library, although Senator Willey escaped their control."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,Bands of guerrillas burned and looted in some sections and were not completely eliminated until after the end of the war.
21598,47,west_virginia,21598,The counties of Panhandle East were more affected by the war as military control of the area changed hands several times.
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The region that became West Virginia did indeed provide about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, about 22,000 to 25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to remove voting rights from the Confederates' return in order to maintain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, stated that if it were not enacted, he would lose the election by 500 votes."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of the Confederates could also be confiscated, and in 1866 a constitutional amendment depriving all those who had helped and comforted the Confederation was adopted."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prompted a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,"The democratic party gained control in 1870, and in 1871 the constitutional amendment of 1866 was repealed."
21605,47,west_virginia,21605,"The first steps towards this change had, however, been taken by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,"On 22 August 1872, a new constitution was adopted."
21607,47,west_virginia,21607," From the reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states challenged the state's share of the debts of the pre-war government of Virginia, which had been primarily committed to financing the improvement of public infrastructure, such as canals, roads and railways, under the leadership of the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,"The Virginians, led by former confederate general William Mahone, formed a political coalition based on this: the Readjuster Party."
21609,47,west_virginia,21609," Although West Virginia's first constitution provided for the acceptance of part of Virginia's debt, the negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were unsuccessful, and in 1871 Virginia financed two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily attributed the rest to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally resolved in 1915 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia was due $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The last payment of this sum was made in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612," Following the reconstruction, the new 35th State benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613," Saltpeter caves had been used throughout Appalachia to manufacture ammunition; the border between West Virginia and Virginia included the Saltpeter Trail, a chain of limestone caves containing rich calcium nitrate deposits that were returned and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail extends from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the road in the town of Union, Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615," Nearly half of these caves are on the west side of Virginia, including the Organ Cave and the Haynes Cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"In the late 18th century, Haynes Cave saltpeter miners found large animal bones in the deposits."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617," They were sent to Thomas Jefferson by a local historian and border soldier, Colonel John Stuart."
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were called Megalonyx jeffersonii, or big claw, and became known as Jefferson's three-finger lazy."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,It was declared the official fossil of the State of West Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The official rock of the state of West Virginia is the bituminous coal, and the official gemstone of the state is silicified fossil Mississippi Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621," Limestone has also produced a useful, generally small, quarry industry and softer, high-calcium seams have been burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622," This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years, a specific portion of the C & O railway carried limestone rock to Clifton Forge, Virginia, as an industrial stream."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"The extraction of salt had been under way since the 18th century, although it played largely in the era of the American civil war, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a precious commodity of the first Confederate forces, then of the Union."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In the following years, more sophisticated extraction methods would restore the role of West Virginia as the leading salt producer."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625," However, in the second half of the 19th century there was an even larger treasure that was not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626, This would feed much of the industrial revolution in the United States and the steam ships of many of the world's marines.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627, Residents (indigenous and early European settlers) had long known the underlying coal and could use it for heating and fuel.
21628,47,west_virginia,21628," However, for a long time, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629," After the war, with the new railways came a practical method of transporting large quantities of coal to the expansion of US and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630," While the anthracite mines in northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began playing during the same period, investors and industrialists focused their interest on Western Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted have studied potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) across the state to the new town of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River coalfield.
21633,47,west_virginia,21633," Soon, the C&O built its huge coal wharf at Newport News, Virginia, on the large harbour of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new owners of the former Atlantic Railway, Mississippi and Ohio (AM&O), which extended into southern Virginia from Norfolk, had clear views of the state of the mountains, where the owners had extensive lands."
21635,47,west_virginia,21635," Their railway was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railway city was developed in Roanoke to manage the planned expansion."
21636,47,west_virginia,21636," After his new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party travelled on horseback and first-hand saw the rich bituminous seam of coal, which Kimball's wife named Pocahontas, the N&W redirected his expansion project to the west to reach it."
21637,47,west_virginia,21637," Soon, the N&W also sailed from new coal jetties at Hampton Roads."
21638,47,west_virginia,21638,"In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and western railway lines, the important coal-mining centre of Bluefield, West Virginia was founded."
21639,47,west_virginia,21639,"The capital of the Pocahontas coalfield, this town would remain the largest city in the southern part of the state for several decades."
21640,47,west_virginia,21640,"He shares a sister city of the same name, Bluefield, Virginia."
21641,47,west_virginia,21641,"In the northern part of the state and elsewhere, the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and other lines also developed to take advantage of coal opportunities."
21642,47,west_virginia,21642,The B&O developed coal jetties in Baltimore and several locations on the Great Lakes.
21643,47,west_virginia,21643," Other major coal rail carriers were the Western Maryland Railway (WM), Southern Railway (SOU), and Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N)."
21644,47,west_virginia,21644,"One delayer, the Virginian Railway (VGN), was particularly remarkable."
21645,47,west_virginia,21645,"In 1900, only the most rugged terrain in southwestern Virginia was at any distance from existing railways and mining activity."
21646,47,west_virginia,21646,"In this area west of the New River coalfield, in Raleigh and Wyoming counties, is the Winding Gulf coalfield, later promoted as ""Billion Dollar Coalfield""."
21647,47,west_virginia,21647,"Ansted's protégé was William Nelson Page (1854–1932), civil engineer and mining director of Fayette County."
21648,47,west_virginia,21648,"The former Governor of West Virginia William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land ""as a farmer knows a field."""
21649,47,west_virginia,21649," From 1898, Page teamed up with investors in the North and Europe to take advantage of the undeveloped area."
21650,47,west_virginia,21650," They acquired extensive land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short-line railway chartered to stretch between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka, a distance of approximately 80 miles (130 km)."
21651,47,west_virginia,21651," Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive marine transportation contract by either railway, the managers of the two major railways did not appreciate the project."
21652,47,west_virginia,21652,"In the secret collusion, everyone refused to negotiate favorable tariffs with Page, and did not offer to buy their railway, as they had many other short lines."
21653,47,west_virginia,21653," However, if the presidents of the C&O and N&W thought they could kill the Page project, they had to be wrong."
21654,47,west_virginia,21654,"One of Page's silent investor-partners was the million-dollar industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a director of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, and a former hand in natural resource development and transportation."
21655,47,west_virginia,21655,"Master of competitive ""war"", Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his efforts and also had ""deep pockets""."
21656,47,west_virginia,21656," Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and built their tracks throughout Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost."
21657,47,west_virginia,21657," When the Virginian Railway (VGN) was completed in 1909, no fewer than three railways shipped ever increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads."
21658,47,west_virginia,21658,West Virginia coal was also in high demand in Great Lakes ports.
21659,47,west_virginia,21659,"The NGV and N&W have finally become parts of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the well-developed 21st century NGV lanes continue to provide a favourable gradient for Hampton roads."
21660,47,west_virginia,21660,"As coal mining and related work became important employment activities in the State, working conditions, safety and economic problems arose."
21661,47,west_virginia,21661," Even in the twenty-first century, mining safety and environmental concerns are still difficult for the state whose coal continues to supply power plants in many other states."
21662,47,west_virginia,21662," Coal is not the only valuable mineral found in West Virginia, since the state was the site of the discovery in 1928 of the 34.48 carat Jones diamond (6.896 g)."
21663,47,west_virginia,21663," Located in the Appalachian Range, West Virginia covers an area of 62,754.8 km2, with 62,361.0 km2 of land and 393.8 km2 of water, making it the 41st state of the United States."
21664,47,west_virginia,21664,"Western Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest, and Kentucky in the southwest."
21665,47,west_virginia,21665," Its longest border is with Virginia 381 miles (613 km), followed by Ohio 243 miles (391 km), Maryland 174 miles (280 km), Pennsylvania 118 miles (190 km) and Kentucky 79 miles (127 km)."
21666,47,west_virginia,21666,"West Virginia is entirely located in the Appalachian region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi (""The mounttains are still free"")."
21667,47,west_virginia,21667,Altitudes and robustness fall close to large rivers such as the Ohio River or the Shenandoah River.
21668,47,west_virginia,21668, Approximately 75% of the state is located in the Cumberland Plateau and the Allegheny Plateau.
21669,47,west_virginia,21669," Although the terrain is not high, the plateau region is extremely rugged in most areas."
21670,47,west_virginia,21670,"The average altitude of West Virginia is about 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, which is the highest of all U.S. states east of the Mississippi River."
21671,47,west_virginia,21671,"On the eastern line of the state with Virginia, peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region result in an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those in northern New England and eastern Canada."
21672,47,west_virginia,21672,"The highest point in the state is the top of Spruce Knob, at 1863 feet (1,482 m), and is covered in dense spruce boreal forest at altitudes greater than 4,000 feet (1,200 m)."
21673,47,west_virginia,21673, Spruce Knob is located in the Monongahela National Forest and is part of the Spruce Knob-Senatorca Rocks National Recreation Area.
21674,47,west_virginia,21674,"In total, six wild areas are also found in the forest."
21675,47,west_virginia,21675," Outside the forest to the south, the gorge of the New River is a 300 metre deep canyon carved by the New River."
21676,47,west_virginia,21676,The National Parks Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the New River Gorge Reserve and National Park.
21677,47,west_virginia,21677, Other areas that are protected and managed include:
21678,47,west_virginia,21678," Most of West Virginia lies in the mixed ecoregion of Appalachian Mesophyte forests, while the high elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie in the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests."
21679,47,west_virginia,21679,"The native vegetation of most of the State was originally a mixed forest of hardwood oak, chestnut, maple, beech and white pine, with American willow and sycamore along the rivers of the State."
21680,47,west_virginia,21680," Many of these areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact appreciated by native Virginians, who refer to their home as being almost sky (from the song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" by John Denver)."
21681,47,west_virginia,21681," Prior to the song, it was known as ""The Cog State"" (coal, oil and gas) or ""The Mountain State""."
21682,47,west_virginia,21682,"The underlying rock strata are sandstone, shale, bituminous coal beds, and limestone placed in an environment close to the coast from sediments derived from the mountains to the east in a shallow inland sea to the west."
21683,47,west_virginia,21683," Some beds illustrate coastal marshland, river delta, shallow waters."
21684,47,west_virginia,21684,"Sea levels rose and fell several times during the Mississippi and Pennsylvania eras, giving a variety of rocky strata."
21685,47,west_virginia,21685,"The Appalachians are some of the oldest on earth, having formed more than three hundred million years ago."
21686,47,west_virginia,21686,"West Virginia's climate is generally a humid subtropical climate (climate classification of Köppen Cfa, with the exception of Dfb at higher altitudes) with warm to warm, humid and cold winters, increasing in severity with altitude."
21687,47,west_virginia,21687, Some areas of the southern highlands also have a temperate mountain climate (Köppen Cfb) where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures cooler.
21688,47,west_virginia,21688," However, the time is subject to change in all parts of the state."
21689,47,west_virginia,21689,Hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the Central Appalachian Mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the low altitudes.
21690,47,west_virginia,21690,"In the Eastern Panhandle and Ohio Valley, temperatures are warm enough to see and cultivate subtropical plants such as southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), bluertle crepe, Albizia julibrisin, American sweetgum, and even needle palm and minor sabal."
21691,47,west_virginia,21691, These plants do not flourish as well in other parts of the state.
21692,47,west_virginia,21692,The prickly pear of the East grows well in many parts of the state.

21698,47,west_virginia,21698,The eastern valleys are less rainy because the mountain ridges of the Allegheny in the west create a partial rain shadow.
21699,47,west_virginia,21699, Just over half of the precipitation occurs between April and September.
21700,47,west_virginia,21700,"Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section, especially in the Tygart Valley."

21702,47,west_virginia,21702,"In addition to the persistent cloudy sky caused by the degradation of humidity by the Alleghenies, West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation, with snowshoes on average nearly 200 days a year with rain or snow."
21703,47,west_virginia,21703,"Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections, but may persist for weeks in the upper mountainous regions."
21704,47,west_virginia,21704,"On average, 34 inches (860 mm) of snow fall each year in Charleston, although in the winter of 1995-96, more than three times that amount declined, with several cities in the state setting new snowfall records."
21705,47,west_virginia,21705," Average snowfalls in the Highlands of Allegheny can reach up to 180 inches (4,600 mm) per year."
21706,47,west_virginia,21706,"Violent weather is a little less common in West Virginia than in most other eastern states, and it ranks among the least vulnerable states to tornadoes east of the Rockies."
21707,47,west_virginia,21707,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the population of West Virginia was 1,792,147 on July 1, 2018, a decrease of 3.28 per cent from the 2010 U.S. Census."

22364,49,wyoming,22364,"The first inhabitants of the region are Arapaho, Crow, Lakota and Shoshone."
22365,49,wyoming,22365,The south-west of Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire and then as Mexican territory until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the war between Mexico and America.

22373,49,wyoming,22373,"Wyoming's climate is generally semi-arid and continental (Köppen climate classification BSk), and is drier and more windy compared to most United States with higher extreme temperatures."
22374,49,wyoming,22374, This is largely due to the topography of the State.
22375,49,wyoming,22375,Summers at Wyoming are warm with high July temperatures averaged between 85 and 95°F (29 and 35°C) in most of the state.

22381,49,wyoming,22381, Precipitation depends on altitude with lower areas in the Big Horn Basin on average from 5 to 8 inches (130 to 200 mm) (which makes the region a real desert).
22382,49,wyoming,22382,"The lower areas in the North and the eastern plains generally have an average of about 10 to 12 inches (250 to 300 mm), making the climate semi-arid."

22392,49,wyoming,22392," Due to the inaccuracy of surveys during the 19th century, Wyoming's legal boundary deviates from actual latitude and longitude lines to half a mile (0.8 km) in some places, particularly in the mountainous region along the 45th parallel."

22431,49,wyoming,22431," Most are administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service in many national forests and a national meadow, not to mention extensive ""public"" lands and an air base near Cheyenne."
22432,49,wyoming,22432, There are also areas managed by the National Park Service and agencies such as the United States
22433,49,wyoming,22433,Fish & Wildlife Service.

22450,49,wyoming,22450,"In addition, copper has been mined in some areas between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the snowline near Grand Encampment."
22451,49,wyoming,22451," Once the government-sponsored expeditions to Yellowstone country began, Colter and Bridger's reports, previously believed apocryphal, were true."
22452,49,wyoming,22452," This led to the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, which became the first national park in the world in 1872."

22454,49,wyoming,22454,"On December 10, 1869, the Governor of the Territory John Allen Campbell extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and, later, the State of the United States, granting women the right to vote."

22470,49,wyoming,22470,"In 2015, Wyoming had an estimated population of 586,107, an increase of 1,954, or 0.29%, over the previous year and an increase of 22,481, or 3.99%, since the 2010 census."
22471,49,wyoming,22471," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase compared to the net migration of 4,035 in the state."

22476,49,wyoming,22476,Wyoming has the second lowest population density in the country (behind Alaska) and is the sparsest of 48 contiguous states.
22477,49,wyoming,22477,It is one of the only two states (Vermont) whose population is smaller than that of the national capital.
22478,49,wyoming,22478," According to the 2000 Census, Wyoming's main ancestry groups are German (26.0%), English (16.0%), Irish (13.3%), Norwegian (4.3%) and Swedish (3.5%)."
22479,49,wyoming,22479,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, resulting in a higher overall number."
22480,49,wyoming,22480,"The Constitution of Wyoming establishes three powers of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
22481,49,wyoming,22481,The legislative power of the State is composed of a 60-member House of Representatives and a 30-member Senator.

22485,49,wyoming,22485,"The small population of Wyoming earned him only one seat in the United States House of Representatives, and thus only three votes in the electoral college."
22486,49,wyoming,22486,"The Wyoming State Liquor Association is the only legal distributor of spirits in the state, making it a state of control over alcoholic beverages."

22488,49,wyoming,22488,"Wyoming's highest court is Wyoming's Supreme Court, with five judges presiding over appeals from the lower courts of the state."
22489,49,wyoming,22489,"Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate court of appeal, like most States."
22490,49,wyoming,22490, This is largely due to the government's population and the corresponding decrease in workload.
22491,49,wyoming,22491, Appeals from State District Courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court.
22492,49,wyoming,22492,"Wyoming also has limited state circuit courts (formerly county courts), which deal with certain types of cases, such as civil claims with lower amounts, criminal offences and criminal prosecution."
22493,49,wyoming,22493,Itinerant court judges are also routinely referred to cases involving small claims.
22494,49,wyoming,22494," Prior to 1972, Wyoming judges were chosen by popular vote in a non-partisan vote."
22495,49,wyoming,22495," This earlier system was criticized by the State Bar, which called for the adoption of the Missouri Plan, a system designed to balance the independence of the judiciary with judicial accountability."
22496,49,wyoming,22496,"In 1972, an amendment to article 5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which incorporates an amended version of the plan, was adopted by voters."

22498,49,wyoming,22498, They are then subjected to a vote of loyalty by the electorate one year after their appointment.
22499,49,wyoming,22499,Wyoming's political history challenges easy classification.
22500,49,wyoming,22500,The State had been the first to grant women the right to vote and elect a woman governor.
22501,49,wyoming,22501,"On December 10, 1869, John Allen Campbell, first governor of Wyoming territory, approved the first law in U.S. history explicitly granting women the right to vote."
22502,49,wyoming,22502, That day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day.
22503,49,wyoming,22503,"On 5 November 1889, voters approved the first constitution in the world that grants women full voting rights."
22504,49,wyoming,22504," While the state elected notable democrats to the federal office in the 1960s and 1970s, politics has become resolutely more conservative since the 1980s when the Republican Party came to dominate the delegation of the State Congress."
22505,49,wyoming,22505," Today Wyoming is represented in Washington by his two senators, John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and his only member of the House of Representatives, MP Liz Cheney."
22506,49,wyoming,22506,The three are Republicans
22507,49,wyoming,22507,"The state has not voted for a democrat for the president since 1964, one of only eight times since the status of state."
22508,49,wyoming,22508," Currently, there is only one relatively reliable democratic county, the Teton tributary, and one swing county, Albany collegial county."
22509,49,wyoming,22509,"In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won his second victory, with 69 per cent of the vote."
22510,49,wyoming,22510, Former Vice-President Dick Cheney is a resident of Wyoming and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.
22511,49,wyoming,22511,The Republicans are no less dominant at the state level.
22512,49,wyoming,22512, They have been the majority in the Senate of the State since 1936 and in the State House since 1964.
22513,49,wyoming,22513," However, the Democrats held the office of governor every eight years, except between 1975 and 2011."
22514,49,wyoming,22514,"In particular, Wyoming elected Democrat Nellie Tayloe Ross as the first woman in the history of the United States to serve as governor of state."
