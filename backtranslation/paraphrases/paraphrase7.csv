123,0,alabama,123,"In view of this emigration, the rate of population growth in Alabama (see the table ""historical populations"" below) declined by almost half between 1910 and 1920."

136,0,alabama,136, They maintained an old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
137,0,alabama,137,"As a result, Jefferson County, home to Birmingham's industrial and economic power, paid more than a third of all tax revenues to the state, but did not receive a proportionate amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests are still under-represented in the legislature.
139,0,alabama,139," According to a study carried out in 1960, due to rural domination, ""a minority of about 25 per cent of the total population of the state controls the majority of the Alabama Legislative Assembly""."
140,0,alabama,140,"In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the United States Supreme Court held that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" should be the basis of both chambers of state legislatures, and that their districts should be based on population rather than geographic counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the redistribution of Congress on the basis of the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142," This has benefited urban areas that have developed, as well as the population as a whole that has been underrepresented for more than 60 years."
143,0,alabama,143, Other changes have been made to the establishment of a representative state house and senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144," African-Americans continued to lobby in the 1950s and 1960s to end exclusion and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools should be disaggregated, but the Alabama was slow to comply."
146,0,alabama,146,"In the 1960s, under the leadership of Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted federal requirements for desegregation."
147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement experienced significant events in Alabama, including the boycott of the Montgomery buses (1955-1956), the Freedom Rides in 1961 and the Selma marches to Montgomery in 1965."
148,0,alabama,148, They contributed to the adoption and adoption by the U.S. Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

150,0,alabama,150," According to the New York Times, in 2017, many Afro-Americans in Alabama lived in the cities of Alabama, such as Birmingham and Montgomery."
151,0,alabama,151,"In addition, the area of the black belt in the centre of Alabama ""shelters largely poor counties that are mainly African-American."
152,0,alabama,152," These counties are Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made some changes since the end of the twentieth century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus case of redistriction, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the general vote for seats representing 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155," Voting in general had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats."
156,0,alabama,156," Despite the African-Americans who constitute an important minority in the state, they have not been able to elect any representative in most jurisdictions in general."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of the resolution of this case, five Alabama towns and counties, including Chilton County, have adopted a cumulative voting system for the election of representatives in multiple-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158, This has led to a more proportional representation of voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in the County of Conecuh."
160,0,alabama,160,"In 1982, the limited vote was first tested in Conecuh County."

162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth state of the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of the total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making the Alabama 23rd in quantity of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the United States."

347,0,alabama,347,"The basic document of the Alabama government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901."
348,0,alabama,348," With almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is, according to some, the longest constitution in the world and represents about 40 times the duration of the United States Constitution."
349,0,alabama,349, There was an important movement to rewrite and modernize the Alabama Constitution.
350,0,alabama,350," Critics argue that the Alabama constitution maintains a highly centralized power with the state parliament, leaving virtually no power in local hands."
351,0,alabama,351, Most counties do not have the house rule.
352,0,alabama,352," Any proposed policy change in the different regions of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, often, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353,A criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
354,0,alabama,354,The government of Alabama is divided into three co-equal branches.
355,0,alabama,355,"The legislature is the Legislative Assembly of Alabama, a bicameral assembly composed of the House of Representatives of Alabama, with 105 members, and the Senator of Alabama, with 35 members."
356,0,alabama,356,"The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, adopting or rejecting state legislation."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both Houses of the Legislative Assembly.
358,0,alabama,358,The legislature has the power to derogate from the veto by a simple majority (most state legislatures need a two-thirds majority to derogate from the veto).
359,0,alabama,359," Until 1964, the State elected state senators on a geographical basis per county, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360," Since its constitution was adopted in 1901, it has not redistributed Congressional constituencies; therefore, urbanized areas have been heavily underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,Nor has it changed the legislative districts to take account of the decennial censuses.
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one vote"", ruling that Congressional constituencies should be recomposed on the basis of censuses (as the state had already included in its constitution but had not been implemented)."
363,0,alabama,363,"In addition, the Court decided that the two chambers of the legislatures of bicameral States should be distributed by population, as there was no constitutional basis for States to have geographical systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other States had to change their legislative districts, as many countries had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365, This has led to decades of under-investment in these areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For example, taxes in Birmingham County and Jefferson had provided one third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of the state's funding."
367,0,alabama,367," Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama Legislative Assembly controlled county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive is responsible for the enforcement and control of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is led by the governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370," Other members of the executive branch include the Cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Secretary of State of Alabama, the Treasurer of Alabama and the Auditor of State of Alabama."
371,0,alabama,371,The present governor is Republican Kay Ivey.
372,0,alabama,372, Members of Parliament take up office immediately after the November elections.
373,0,alabama,373," Government officials, such as the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General and other constitutional officers, took office the following January."
374,0,alabama,374,The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the State Constitution and applying the law in criminal and civil cases.
375,0,alabama,375,The highest court in the State is the Supreme Court of Alabama.
376,0,alabama,376,The Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.
377,0,alabama,377," Since the 1980s, judicial campaigns have become more and more politicized."
378,0,alabama,378,The current Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All judges serving on the Supreme Court of Alabama are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380," There are two intermediate courts of appeal, the Civil Court of Appeal and the Criminal Court of Appeal, and four courts of first instance: the Circuit Court (court of first instance of general jurisdiction) and the District, Provincial and Municipal Courts."
381,0,alabama,381, Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an extremely high implementation rate.
382,0,alabama,382,Alabama had the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In a few years, it imposes more death sentences than Texas, a state with a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384," However, executions per capita are much higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385, Some of his cases have been the subject of considerable controversy.
386,0,alabama,386,It was the only State to allow judges to disregard the decisions of the jury when deciding whether or not to apply the death penalty.
387,0,alabama,387, This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,The taxes are collected by the Alabama Ministry of Revenue.
389,0,alabama,389,"Alabama collects a tax of 2, 4, or 5% on personal income, depending on the amount earned and the status of production."
390,0,alabama,390," Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their tax in the state of Alabama, even if they take the standard deduction; those who list it can also deduct the FICA (social security and health insurance tax)."
391,0,alabama,391,The general rate of the State's sales tax is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392,City and county sales tax rates are also added to the purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a dinner in Mobile would pay 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"In 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 51 per cent of all government and local revenues, compared to an average of about 36 per cent in the country as a whole."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of the seven states that levy a food tax at the same rate as other goods, and one of the two states (the other being the neighbouring Mississippi) that fully taxes grocery without any compensation for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most States exempt food products from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on working poor families is one of the highest in the United States, Alabama, the only state to levy income tax on a family of four people whose income does not exceed $4,600, or barely a quarter of the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,The Alabama threshold is lowest among the 41 states and the Columbia district with income taxes.
399,0,alabama,399,The current corporate income tax rate is 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400," Overall, the federal, state and local tax burden in Alabama places the State as the second lowest tax burden in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Land taxes are the lowest in the United States.
402,0,alabama,402,The current state constitution requires an electoral referendum to increase property taxes.
403,0,alabama,403,"As Alabama's tax structure is largely dependent on consumer spending, it is subject to a variable and high budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit of $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405, There are 67 counties in Alabama.
406,0,alabama,406," Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually referred to as the county commission."
407,0,alabama,407,He also has limited executive powers in the county.
408,0,alabama,408," Due to the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby and Tuscaloosa) of the state have a limited domestic regime."
409,0,alabama,409," Instead, most state counties must put pressure on the local Legislative Committee of the State Legislative Assembly to obtain approval for simple local policies, ranging from waste disposal to land-use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The State Legislative Assembly retained power over local governments by refusing to adopt a constitutional amendment establishing the internal system of counties, as recommended by the Alabama Constitutional Commission of 1973."
411,0,alabama,411, Legislative delegations retain certain powers in respect of each county.
412,0,alabama,412,"In Baker v. Carr (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court demanded that both houses have population-based districts and redistributed after each census in order to apply the ""one man, one voice"" principle."
413,0,alabama,413," Prior to this, each county was represented by a state senator, resulting in under-representation in the state senate for the more urbanized and populated counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had failed to redistribute seats in the state house, affected politics well before the 20th century, not recognizing the growth of industrial towns and urbanized areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The absence of a domestic regime for Alabama counties has led to the proliferation of local legislation allowing counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution."
416,0,alabama,416,"The constitution of Alabama has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to a single county or city."
417,0,alabama,417,"A significant part of each legislative session is devoted to local legislation, taking time and attention from legislators on issues of importance at the state level."""
418,0,alabama,418,"Alabama is a state that controls alcoholic beverages, meaning that the state government has a monopoly on the sale of alcohol."
419,0,alabama,419,The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state.
420,0,alabama,420,"A total of 25 of the 67 counties are ""dry counties"" that prohibit the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in the counties that allow the sale of alcohol."
421,0,alabama,421," During the reconstruction following the American civil war, Alabama was occupied by federal troops in the third military district under the leadership of General John Pope."
422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as Redemptors took control of the government of the state of republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423," After 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to separate and dissociate African-American residents, a process completed in the provisions of the 1901 Constitution."
424,0,alabama,424, Provisions that deprive Blacks of their right to vote have led to the exclusion of many poor whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"In 1941, more whites than blacks were deprived of their rights: 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total impact has been greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens have been deprived of their rights and relegated to separate and unequal treatment according to the law."
427,0,alabama,427," From 1901 to 1960, the state did not redraw electoral districts as the population increased and moved within the state during the urbanization and industrialization of certain regions."
428,0,alabama,428,"As the counties were at the base of the electoral districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics for nearly three quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases had to be redistributed in 1972 to be represented on an equal footing."
429,0,alabama,429,"The policy of the state of Alabama received national and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, while whites, bureaucraticly and sometimes violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."
430,0,alabama,430," Governor George Wallace, the only four-man governor of the state, was a controversial figure who promised to maintain segregation."
431,0,alabama,431,"It was only after the adoption of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that African Americans regained the capacity to vote, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many countries, they have continued to be excluded from representation through general electoral systems, allowing the majority of the population to dominate the elections."
433,0,alabama,433, Some changes have taken place at the county level as a result of judicial challenges to create single-member districts that allow for more diverse representation among county councils.
434,0,alabama,434,"In 2007, Alabama's Legislature voted, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing ""deep regret"" about slavery and its continuing impact."

698,1,alaska,698," Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated regions in the world, with 1.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.46/km2), and the next state, Wyoming, with 5.8 inhabitants per square kilometre (2.2/km2)."
699,1,alaska,699, Alaska is by far the largest American state by region and the tenth richest country (income per capita).
700,1,alaska,700,"In November 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%.In 2018, it was one of the 14 U.S. states that had only one telephone area code yet."
701,1,alaska,701," According to the 2010 United States Census, Alaska had 710,231 inhabitants."
702,1,alaska,702,"In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.1% non-Hispanic whites), 14.8% Alaska Natives, 5.4% Asians, 3.3% Blacks or Afro-Americans, 1.0% Hawaii Natives and other Pacific Islanders, 1.6% other races and 7.3% two or more races."
703,1,alaska,703, Hispanics or Latinos of any race represented 5.5% of the population.
704,1,alaska,704,"In 2011, 50.7 per cent of Alaska's population under one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., she did not have two non-Hispanic white parents)."
705,1,alaska,705," According to the 2011 American Community Survey, 83.4% of people over five years of age spoke English only at home."
706,1,alaska,706," About 3.5% spoke Spanish at home, 2.2% spoke another Indo-European language, approximately 4.3% spoke an Asian language (including Tagalog) and about 5.3% spoke other languages at home."
707,1,alaska,707,The Alaska Native Language Centre at the University of Alaska Fairbanks states that there are at least 20 Aboriginal languages in Alaska and that there are also some languages with different dialects.
708,1,alaska,708," Most of Alaska's Aboriginal languages belong either to Eskimo-Aleut language families or to na-dene language families; however, some languages are considered to be isolates (e.g., Equimal-Aleut)."

711,1,alaska,711,"In 2014, almost all of Alaska's native languages were classified as threatened, changing, moribund, almost extinct or dormant."
712,1,alaska,712,"In total, 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state, known locally as ""indigenous languages""."
713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring that the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state have official status."
714,1,alaska,714," This bill has given them symbolic recognition as official languages, even if they have not been adopted for official purposes within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages that were included in the bill are as follows:
716,1,alaska,716," According to statistics collected by the 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives, about 34% of Alaskans were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people were identified as evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholics and 32,550 as main line Protestants."
718,1,alaska,718," Approximately 4% are Mormons, 0.5% are Jewish, 1% are Muslim, 0.5% are Buddhist, 0.2% are Bahá'ís and 0.5% are Hindu."
719,1,alaska,719,"The largest religious denominations in Alaska in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents, evangelical non-denominational Protestants with 38,070 adherents, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Days Saints with 32,170 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents."
720,1,alaska,720," Alaska has been identified, along with the Pacific Pacific States Washington and Oregon, as the least religious states of the United States, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,In 1795 the first Russian Orthodox Church was founded in Kodiak.
722,1,alaska,722, Marriage to Alaskan natives helped Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches have gradually established themselves in Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724, Alaska also has the largest population of Quaker (percentage) in any state.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for which Halakha's observance could pose particular problems)."
726,1,alaska,726,"The Hindus of Alaska often share places and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including the Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, the Hindus of Alaska established the Sri Gansha temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu temple in Alaska and the most northern Hindu temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728,"It is estimated there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Hindus in Alaska."
729,1,alaska,729,The great majority of Hindus live in Anchorage or Fairbanks.
730,1,alaska,730," Estimates for the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000."
731,1,alaska,731,"In the late 1990s, the Anchorage Islamic Community Centre began to build a mosque in Anchorage."
732,1,alaska,732, They opened the ground on a building in the south of Anchorage in 2010 and were almost finished by the end of 2014.
733,1,alaska,733," Once completed, the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the most northerly mosques in the world."
734,1,alaska,734, There is also a Bahá'í center.
735,1,alaska,735,"The 2018 gross domestic product was $55 billion, the country's 48th largest."
736,1,alaska,736,"Her per capita personal income in 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the country."
737,1,alaska,737," According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent."
738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80 per cent of the government's revenues from oil extraction."
739,1,alaska,739," Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is sea fish, mainly salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture accounts for a very small fraction of Alaska's economy.
741,1,alaska,741," Agricultural production is mainly intended for consumption within the state and includes nurseries, dairy products, vegetables and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742," Manufacturing is limited, with most food and general goods being imported from other countries."
743,1,alaska,743," Employment primarily affects government and industries such as natural resource extraction, marine transportation and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744," Military bases are an important part of the economy of Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island, as well as Kodiak."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the government to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746," Its industrial outputs include crude oil, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other extractive industries, seafood processing, wood and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747, There is also an expanding services and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748, Tourists contributed to the economy by supporting local accommodation.
749,1,alaska,749," Alaska has significant energy resources, although its oil reserves have been extensively depleted."
750,1,alaska,750," Significant oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, in February 2014, Alaska was ranked fourth in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota and California."
751,1,alaska,751," Prudhoe Bay on the northern slope of Alaska is still the second-high-yielding oil field in the United States, generally producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although at the beginning of 2014, the North Dakota Bakken Formation produced more than 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752," Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil deposit ever discovered in North America, but it was much smaller than the huge Athabasca oil sands deposit in Canada, which in 2014 produced approximately 1,500 000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of productive reserves at that rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"The Trans-Alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"In addition, large coal deposits are found in Alaska's oil, subbituminous, and lignite basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered gas technically recoverable from natural gas hydrates on the northern slope of Alaska."
756,1,alaska,756, Alaska also has some of the country's highest hydroelectric potential from its many rivers.
757,1,alaska,757,Large stretches of Alaska's coastline also offer potential for wind and geothermal energy.
758,1,alaska,758," Alaska's economy relies heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electricity and light."
759,1,alaska,759," While wind and hydro power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g., wind and hydro power) are not yet fully developed."
760,1,alaska,760,"It was found to be unprofitable (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low fuel prices (less than 50¢/gal), long distances and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of one gallon of gas in urban Alaska is generally thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally much higher, but vary greatly depending on transportation costs, seasonal peaks of use, nearby oil development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is an appropriation authorized by the Constitution of Oil Revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus of the state's oil revenues, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Trans Alaska pipeline system."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the sale of the Prudhoe Bay lease in 1969, for fear that legislators would spend all of the proceeds of the sale (i.e. $900 million) at the same time."
764,1,alaska,764,He was later defended by Governor Jay Hammond and State representative Kenai Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765," This is an attractive political perspective since then, which diverts revenue that would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaskan Constitution was drafted to discourage the allocation of public funds for specific purposes.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mainly because of the political climate of distrust that existed at the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768," From its initial capital of $734,000, the fund has increased to $50 billion due to oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769, Most if not all of the capital is invested conservatively outside Alaska.
770,1,alaska,770," This has led to frequent calls from Alaskan politicians for the Fund to invest in Alaska, although such a position has never gained momentum."
771,1,alaska,771," Beginning in 1982, dividends from the annual growth of the fund were paid each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial amount of $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years of payment, since the distribution of payments was suspended in a distribution plan prosecution) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time amount of $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772," Each year, the state legislature withdraws 8% of the earnings, gives 3% to the capital for proof of inflation, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all eligible Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To be eligible for the dividend from the Permanent Fund, one must have lived in the State for a minimum of 12 months, maintain permanent residence subject to authorized absences and not be subject to judicial judgements or criminal convictions that fall within various categories of exclusion or may subject the amount of the payment to civil arrest."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often seen as one of the main examples of a ""core income"" policy in the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than the 48 contiguous states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal government officials, particularly U.S. Postal Service (USPS) workers and active members, receive a subsistence allowance usually set at 25% of basic pay because, although the cost of living has decreased, it remains one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to relatively limited transport infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778," Because of the northern climate and the short growing season, there is relatively little farming in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779," Most farms are located either in the Matanuska Valley, about 64 km northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 97 km southwest of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons."
781,1,alaska,781,"The main crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another remarkable agricultural site, particularly the Delta Junction area, about 160 kilometres south-east of Fairbanks, with a large concentration of farms growing agronomic crops, mainly to the north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783, This region was largely set aside and developed as part of a state programme led by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784, Crops in the delta area consist mainly of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"To the west of Fairbanks is another concentration of small farms that deal with restaurants, the hotel and tourism industry and community-supported agriculture."
786,1,alaska,786,"In recent years, Alaskan agriculture has seen strong growth in market gardeners, small farms and agricultural markets, with the largest percentage increase (46%) in agricultural market growth in the country in 2011, compared to 17% in the country as a whole."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also grown, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a supply gap elsewhere in the world, filling a niche on the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788," Alaska, without counties, does not have county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789," However, a small assortment of state fairs and local fairs (with Alaska's largest state fair in Palmer) take place mainly in late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"Fairs are primarily located in communities with historical or current farming activities, and include local farmers who exhibit products in addition to more publicized commercial activities such as carnival walks, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792," Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the main fisheries of the Bering Sea and the North Pacific."
793,1,alaska,793,Seafish is one of the few food products that is often cheaper within the state than outside.
794,1,alaska,794," Many Alaskans take advantage of the salmon season to harvest portions of their domestic food while fishing for their livelihood, as well as for sport."
795,1,alaska,795," This includes fish caught by hook, net, or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Subsistence hunting, mainly caribou, moose and Dall sheep, is still common in the state, particularly in remote Bush communities."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of traditional indigenous diet is Akutaq, the Eskimo Ice Cream, which may consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798," Alaska reindeer farming focuses on the Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mixing and migrating with domestic reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799," Most foods in Alaska are transported to the state from ""outside,"" and shipping costs make food relatively expensive in cities."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, hunting and subsistence gathering is an essential activity because imported foods are prohibitive."
801,1,alaska,801," Although most of the small towns and villages in Alaska are along the coast, the cost of importing food into remote villages can be high, due to terrain and difficult road conditions, which change significantly due to climate change and precipitation."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transportation can be up to 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult periods, if these locations can be reached at all during these adverse weather and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering an American gallon of milk (3.8 L) is approximately $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"The cost of fuel per gallon is consistently twenty to thirty cents higher than the United States' contiguous average, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805, Alaska has few road links compared to the rest of the United States.
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road network covers a relatively small area of the state, connecting the central population centres and the Alaska Highway, Canada's main exit route from the state."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a motor ferry; for decades this has sparked the debate about moving the capital to a city on the road network, or the construction of a road link from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,The western part of Alaska has no road network connecting communities to the rest of Alaska.
809,1,alaska,809,The inter-state highways in Alaska consist of a total of 1082 miles.
810,1,alaska,810,"One of the unique features of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an Alaskan railway tunnel in operation recently renovated to provide asphalt road connections to the isolated community of Whittier, Prince William Sound, to the Seward Road, approximately 80 km southeast of Anchorage, Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 4.0 km, the tunnel is North America's longest road tunnel until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812, This tunnel is North America's longest road and rail tunnel.
813,1,alaska,813," Built around 1915, the Alaskan Railway (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska up to the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It connects North Pacific vessels by providing critical infrastructure with routes from Seward to the interior of Alaska through south-central Alaska, through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and the North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815," Cities, villages and the area served by the ARR are known throughout the state as the ""Rail Belt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the continuous improvement of the paved road network has begun to overshadowed the importance of the railway to the Alaskan economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railway played a key role in Alaska's development, moving freight to Alaska while transporting natural resources to the south, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy at Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,It is well known for its summer excursion service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaska Railway was one of the last railways in North America to use cabbages in regular service and still use them on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last stopping roads of the country's flag.
821,1,alaska,821,A section of approximately 100 kilometres of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road
822,1,alaska,822," Until the park road was built in the 1970s, the railway provided the only land access to most of the area along its entire road."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northeastern Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Highway also crosses part of the state from Skagway northward to Canada (British Columbia and Yukon), crossing the border at the White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824," This line is now used mainly by tourists, often arriving by cruise ship in Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was presented in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways.
826,1,alaska,826,The Alaska Rail network is not connected to the outside.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The closest link to the North American rail system is the northwest terminus of Canada's national railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska and Canada, and the 48 less."
829,1,alaska,829, Some private companies operate a float service between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830," Many cities, towns and villages in the State do not have access to the road or highway; the only modes of access are air, river or sea travel."
831,1,alaska,831," Alaska's well-developed ferry system (called the Alaska Highway) serves the cities of the southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832, Ferries carry vehicles as well as passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The network also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada through the inland passage to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important maritime link for many communities on Southeast Prince of Wales Island and works with Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summer tourism market, primarily linking northwestern Pacific to southeastern Alaska and, to a lesser extent, cities along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska."
836,1,alaska,836,"The population of Ketchikan, for example, fluctuates considerably over many days – up to four large cruise ships can moor there at the same time."
837,1,alaska,837," Cities not served by road, sea or river can only be reached by air, foot, dog sled or snow machine, which represents Alaska's highly developed bush air services, a novelty in Alaska."
838,1,alaska,838,"Anchorage and, to a lesser extent, Fairbanks are served by many major airlines."
839,1,alaska,839," Due to limited access to the road, air transportation remains the most efficient form of transport within and outside the State."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed extensive renovation and construction work at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska welcomed nearly two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841," Regular flights to most commercially viable villages and cities in the state are difficult to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government under the Essential Air Services Program."
842,1,alaska,842," Alaska Airlines is the only major airline to offer jet flights in the state (sometimes in combination with Boeing 737-400 cargo and passengers) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional centres such as Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak and other large communities, as well as to large communities in the southeast and the Alaska Peninsula."
843,1,alaska,843,"The majority of the remaining commercial flights come from small regional suburban companies such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"Smaller towns and villages have to rely on regular or chartered bush services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845," Much of this service can be attributed to Alaska's mail bypass program, which subsidizes bulk delivery of mail to rural Alaskan communities."
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires that 70% of this subsidy be paid to carriers providing passenger transportation services to communities.
847,1,alaska,847, Many communities have smaller air taxi services.
848,1,alaska,848, These operations are the result of the demand for personalized transportation to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849, Perhaps the most quintessence plane in Alaska is the bush seaplane.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights to remote villages without airstrips carry passengers, cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,"In 2006, Alaska had the highest per capita number of pilots in all U.S. states."
852,1,alaska,852, Another means of transport from Alaska is the dog sled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (i.e. at any time after the mid-1920s), dog mushing is more a sport than a means of transport."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are organized around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod sled dog race, a trail of 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum race in Nome in which moshers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicines very necessary to the diphtheria community of Nome when all other means of transport had failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from around the world come to Anchorage every March to fight for money, prizes and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that follows more precisely the route of the famous 1925 relay, starting from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) in Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by off-road vehicle and winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as is commonly referred to in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859,The Internet and other data transportation systems in Alaska are largely provided by the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and, at the end of 2011, Alaska Communications announced that it has ""two optical fibre paths to the 48 minus and two more across Alaska."

2522,5,colorado,2522,Colorado's climate is more complex than that of states outside of the mountain states region.
2523,5,colorado,2523,"In contrast to most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado."
2524,5,colorado,2524," Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,The surrounding mountains and valleys have a great impact on the local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a general rule, an increase in altitude results in a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeastern, eastern and southeastern Colorado are primarily the high plains, while northern Colorado is a mixture of high plains, foothills and mountains."
2528,5,colorado,2528,"The northwest and west of Colorado are mostly mountainous, with a few mixed desert lands."
2529,5,colorado,2529,Southwestern and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountainous areas.
2530,5,colorado,2530,"The climate of the eastern plains is semi-arid (Köppen climate classification: BSk) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually 15-25 inches (380-640 millimetres) per year."
2531,5,colorado,2531,"The area is known for its abundant sun and cool and light nights, which gives this region a large range of average daytime temperature."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable since the heat dissipates in the space during the clear nights, the thermal radiation being not trapped by the clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, home to most of Colorado's population, is in a shadow of precipitation due to its presence on the lee side of the Rockies."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this area may have several days above 95°F (35°C) and often 100°F (38°C)."
2535,5,colorado,2535,"In the plains, winter hollows typically range from 25 to -10°F (−4 to -23°C)."
2536,5,colorado,2536," Approximately 75% of precipitation falls during the growing season, from April to September, but this region is highly prone to droughts."
2537,5,colorado,2537," Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and major snowstorms that occur in winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538," Otherwise, the winters tend to be more or less dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,Mars is the most snowy month in most of the region.
2540,5,colorado,2540,"The months of April and May are normally the wettest, while April is the wettest overall."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"The cities of Front Range closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in winter because of the Chinook wind that warms the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70°F (21°C) or higher in winter."
2542,5,colorado,2542,The average July temperature is 55°F (13°C) in the morning and 90°F (32°C) in the afternoon.
2543,5,colorado,2543,"The mean January temperature is 18°F (−8°C) in the morning and 48°F (9°C) in the afternoon, although variations between consecutive days may be 40°F (20°C)."
2544,5,colorado,2544," Just west of the plains and in the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types."
2545,5,colorado,2545, Locations a few kilometres apart can experience a totally different time depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546," Most valleys have a semi-arid climate that is no different from the eastern plains, which changes to an alpine climate at the highest altitudes."
2547,5,colorado,2547," There are also microclimates in local areas that cover almost the full range of climates, including subtropical highlands (Cfb/Cwb), wet subtropicals (Cfa), wet continentals (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterraneans (Csa/Csb) and subarctics (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548," Extreme climate change is common in Colorado, although a significant part of the extreme weather conditions occur in the less populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549," Storms are common east of the continental ditch in the spring and summer, but are usually short."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"The hail is a common view in the mountains east of Divide and across the eastern plains, especially the northeastern part of the state."
2551,5,colorado,2551,"Hail is the most frequently reported serious weather hazard for the warm season and occasionally causes human injury, as well as significant material damage."
2552,5,colorado,2552,The eastern plains are subject to some of the greatest hailstorms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553," Examples include the violent hailstorms that struck Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the most expensive in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The eastern plains are part of the extreme west of the Tornado gangway; some of the harmful tornadoes on the eastern plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town in 2008."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern plains see particularly frequent tornadoes, whether from mesocyclones in supercell storms or from less intense lands, such as in the Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,"The plains are also exposed to occasional flooding and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused by both thunderstorms and the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather."
2557,5,colorado,2557," Significant examples include the Denver flood in 1965, the Big Thompson flood in 1976 and the Colorado flood in 2013."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common in summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's 1901 record for consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken in the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561," Most of Colorado is very dry, with the average condition of only 17 inches (430 millimetres) of precipitation per year at the state level."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely goes through a time when part of it is not to some extent drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563,"The lack of rainfall contributes to the severity of forest fires in the state, such as the Hayman fire in 2002."
2564,5,colorado,2564," Other notable fires include the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, the Waldo Canyon Fire and the June 2012 High Park Fire and the June 2013 Black Forest Fire."
2565,5,colorado,2565," Even these fires were overtaken by the pine mulch fire, the Cameron Peak fire, and the Eastern Troublefire in 2020, which are the three largest fires in Colorado's history (see Colorado Forest Fires in 2020)."
2566,5,colorado,2566," However, some of Colorado's mountainous regions receive a high amount of moisture from winter snowfall."
2567,5,colorado,2567,"The spring melting of these snows often causes large flows of water in the Yampa River, Colorado River, Rio Grande, Arkansas, North Platte River and South Platte River."

3384,7,delaware,3384,"John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of Nanticoke – they may have retained small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating to Chesapeake Bay."
3385,7,delaware,3385,The Kuskarawocks were most probably the Tuscarora.
3386,7,delaware,3386,The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely linked to the Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River.
3387,7,delaware,3387," They had an established hunting and farming society, and they quickly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their former enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock."
3388,7,delaware,3388," With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wanted to remain identified as such left the region and moved to the Alleghany Mountains in the mid-18th century."
3389,7,delaware,3389," Generally, those who did not move out of Delaware's state were baptized, became Christians and were regrouped with other people of colour in official documents and in the minds of their non-Aboriginal American neighbours."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the present Delaware in the Middle Region by establishing a trading post in Zwaanendael, near the Lewes site in 1631."
3391,7,delaware,3391,"In less than a year, all settlers were killed in a dispute with the Amerindian tribes of the region."

3398,7,delaware,3398,Penn established a representative government and briefly combined its two possessions under one general assembly in 1682.
3399,7,delaware,3399," However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had become so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the consent of the lower counties, and the two groups of representatives began to meet alone, one in Philadelphia, and the other in New Castle."
3400,7,delaware,3400,Penn and his heirs remained the owners of both and always appointed the same person as governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory in the lower counties.
3401,7,delaware,3401,The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same Governor was not unique.
3402,7,delaware,3402, Between 1703 and 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.

3408,7,delaware,3408,The merchants at Wilmington harbour had commercial ties with the British.
3409,7,delaware,3409,"For example, New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and John Dickinson, from Kent County, became the ""Penman of the Revolution."""

3420,7,delaware,3420," Many colonialist settlers have come to the Delaware of Maryland and Virginia, where the population has grown rapidly."
3421,7,delaware,3421,The economies of these colonies were mainly based on labour-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves because of the decline of working-class immigrants in England.

4272,9,georgia,4272," They made up 46.7 per cent of the population of the State in 1900, but the proportion of the population of Georgia that was African-American then fell to 28 per cent, mainly due to tens of thousands of people leaving the State during the Great Migration."

4297,9,georgia,4297,"The boundary then turns abruptly around the end of Rabun County at 35° N, although from this point it diverges slightly southward (because of inaccuracies in the initial survey)."
4298,9,georgia,4298," This northern border was originally the border of Georgia and North Carolina to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies encouraged the Georgian legislature to pass a law, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell most of Georgia's territory, which currently includes Alabama and Mississippi."

4321,9,georgia,4321,"The extent to which the time of a given region of Georgia is subtropical depends on latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico and altitude."

4328,9,georgia,4328," Georgia is often hit by hurricanes that hit the Florida Panhandle, weaken on land and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rains inside, a recent example being Hurricane Michael, as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgian coast, brushing the coast on their way north without ever landing."
4329,9,georgia,4329, Hurricane Matthew of 2016 and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 simply did.
4330,9,georgia,4330, Due to anthropogenic change The climate in Georgia is warming.
4331,9,georgia,4331," This situation is already causing major disturbances, for example, due to sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable than many other states because its land is sinking) and warming will continue."

4343,9,georgia,4343,The largest groups of European descent are:
4344,9,georgia,4344,"At the 1980 census, 1,584,303 Georgians claimed English ancestry out of a total population of 3,994,817, making it 40 per cent of the State and the largest ethnic group at the time."
4345,9,georgia,4345," Today, many of these same people claiming to be of ""American"" descent are actually of English origin, and some of them are of Scottish origin; however, their families have been living in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they simply choose to identify themselves as having an ""American"" ancestry or do not actually know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346," Their ancestry dates mainly to the thirteen colonies of origin and, for this reason, many of them are now content to claim ""American"" ancestry, although they are essentially of English origin."
4347,9,georgia,4347,"In 2004, 7.7 per cent of the Georgian population was under the age of 5, 26.4 per cent under the age of 18 and 9.6 per cent under the age of 65."

4349,9,georgia,4349," Historically, about half of Georgia's population was made up of Afro-Americans who, before the civil war, were almost exclusively slaves."
4350,9,georgia,4350,The large migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from rural south to industrial north between 1914 and 1970 reduced the African-American population.
4351,9,georgia,4351," Georgia experienced the second-largest growth of the Asian population in the United States from 1990 to 2000, more than double its size over the 10-year period."

4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonization of a large number of Scottish, English-American and Scottish-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmonts, as well as coastal colonization by some English-Americans and African-Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported into coastal areas in the eighteenth century on several occasions in rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the lower African-American countries.
4356,9,georgia,4356," They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture continue more than in other fields."
4357,9,georgia,4357,"In the creolization of the culture of the South, their food routes have become an integral part of all the kitchens of the South in the Lower Country."

4406,9,georgia,4406," Until 1964, the state government of Georgia had the longest record of domination of a single party by the Democratic Party of any state in the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407, This record was largely established due to the exclusion of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws at the beginning of the 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408," Some elements, such as the obligation to pay taxes and pass literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted until the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century."
4409,9,georgia,4409,"The White Democrats regained power after the reconstruction in part thanks to the efforts of some who resort to intimidation and violence, but this method was discredited."

4414,9,georgia,4414," Most importantly, any Georgian descendant of a veteran of one of those wars was also exempt."
4415,9,georgia,4415," Because in 1908 many white men in Georgia were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only white people to vote well."

4691,10,hawaii,4691,The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an underwater magma source called the Hawaii Hotspot.
4692,10,hawaii,4692,"The process continues to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean moves continuously to the northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes."
4693,10,hawaii,4693," Due to the location of the hotspot, all currently active terrestrial volcanoes occur in the southern half of Hawaii Island."

4705,10,hawaii,4705," Because the Hawaiian Islands are far from other terrestrial habitats, life is supposed to have arrived by wind, waves (i.e."
4706,10,hawaii,4706,"by ocean currents) and wings (i.e.,"
4707,10,hawaii,4707," birds, insects and seeds that they may have worn on their feathers)."
4708,10,hawaii,4708," This isolation, combined with the diversity of the environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates and dry shores), has allowed the evolution of new endemic flora and fauna."

4714,10,hawaii,4714,The main existing islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for less than 10 million years.
4715,10,hawaii,4715,The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a windfield.
4716,10,hawaii,4716,"On a single island, the climate around the coast can vary from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres of annual precipitation) to wet tropical; on the slopes, the environments range from rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres per year), to temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold and dry climate."

4723,10,hawaii,4723,"The monument covers approximately 140,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls and shallow deep waters up to 80 kilometres off the Pacific Ocean, an area larger than all United States national parks combined."
4724,10,hawaii,4724,"The Hawaii climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme due to the almost constant trade winds of the East."
4725,10,hawaii,4725,"Summer levels generally reach approximately 88°F (31°C) during the day, with a low temperature of 75°F (24°C) at night."

4731,10,hawaii,4731,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state, at Pahala on April 27, 1931, was 100°F (38°C), making it bound to Alaska as the lowest record temperature observed in the U.S. state."
4732,10,hawaii,4732,"The record low temperature of Hawaii is 12°F (−11°C) observed in May 1979, at the top of Mauna Kea."
4733,10,hawaii,4733, Hawaii is the only state that has never recorded Fahrenheit subzero temperatures.
4734,10,hawaii,4734," Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into wind and wind zones (ko-olau and kona, respectively) depending on their location relative to the upper mountains."

4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of human discovery and habitat in the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of an academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743," Some archaeologists and historians believe that it is a wave of immigrants from Tahiti around 1000 AD who introduced a new line of high leaders, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the construction of heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744, This later immigration is detailed in the Hawaiian mythology (mo-olelo) about Pa-ao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745, Other authors say that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a subsequent influx of Tahitian settlers and that Pa'ao should be considered a myth.
4746,10,hawaii,4746,"The history of the islands is marked by slow and steady population growth and by the size of the capitals, which has developed to encompass entire islands."
4747,10,hawaii,4747,"The local leaders, called alii, governed their colonies, and waged wars to expand their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals."

4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the archipelago ""Sandwich Islands"" in honour of its sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the location of the islands and making the native name Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form ""Owyhee"" or ""Owhyhee"" is preserved on behalf of certain locations in the U.S. Northwest Pacific, including Owyhee County and the Owyhee Mountains in Idaho, named after three Hawaiian Aboriginal members of a trapping party that has disappeared in the area."

5209,11,idaho,5209, His origin remains a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the U.S. Congress planned to organize a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician who presented himself as an unrecognized delegate of the unofficial Jefferson territory."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a Shoshone term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""the name of the mountains"", but it was later revealed that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he was inspired to give the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"As the name appeared to be made, the U.S. Congress finally decided to appoint the Colorado Territory region instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time that decision was made, the city of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been appointed according to Willing's proposal."
5213,11,idaho,5213,"In the same year, Congress established Colorado Territory, a county called Idaho County, in eastern Washington."
5214,11,idaho,5214,"The county was named after a steamship called Idaho, which was launched on the Columbia River in 1860."
5215,11,idaho,5215,It is not clear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was disclosed.
5216,11,idaho,5216,"In any case, part of Washington's territory, including Idaho County, was used to create the Idaho Territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217," Finally, the name was given to the Idaho Territory, which later became the U.S. state."
5218,11,idaho,5218," Despite this lack of evidence of the origin of the name, many textbooks well in the 20th century repeated as Willing's narrative the name ""Idaho"" derived from the term Shoshone ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,A 1956 Idaho history manual says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"An alternative to etymology attributes the name to the Plains Apache word ""ídaahęγ"" IPA: [í.ta=.h=] (enemy) which was used with reference to the Comanche."

5252,11,idaho,5252," This influence has a moderate effect in winter, where temperatures are not as low as might be expected in a northerly state where altitudes are mostly high."
5253,11,idaho,5253," Maritime influence is less pronounced in the eastern part of the state where rainfall is often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid continental climate."
5254,11,idaho,5254,"Idaho may be warm, although prolonged periods above 98°F (37°C) are rare, with the exception of the lowest point of altitude, Lewiston, who therefore sees little snow."

5270,11,idaho,5270," Between that date and the creation of the Idaho territory on March 4, 1863, at Lewiston, certain parts of the present state were included in the territories of Oregon, Washington and Dakota."
5271,11,idaho,5271,"The new territory included today's Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming."
5272,11,idaho,5272,"The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the Pacific Road and in 1806 on the return, largely following the two directions of the Clearwater River."
5273,11,idaho,5273,"The first non-Aboriginal colony was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Pend Oreille Lake for the fur trade in 1809 by David Thompson of the Northwest Company."
5274,11,idaho,5274,"In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, then working for the Pacific Fur Company, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near Lewiston today."
5275,11,idaho,5275," This position, called ""MacKenzie's Post"" or ""Clearwater"", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was acquired by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned."
5276,11,idaho,5276,"The first attempts by organized communities, within the current borders of Idaho, were initiated in 1860."
5277,11,idaho,5277,Lewiston was the first permanent and incorporated community in 1861.
5278,11,idaho,5278," After a few tribulations as a territory, including the chaotic transfer from the territorial capital of Lewiston to Boise, the abandonment of the right to vote of the Mormonist polygamists supported by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, and a federal attempt to divide the territory between the territory of Washington which obtained state status in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho attained state status in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,Idaho was one of the hardest hit by Pacific Northwest States during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280," Prices fell for Idaho's main crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes brought only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho's farmers saw their annual income fall from $686 in 1929 to $250 in 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a state of tourism and agriculture to include scientific and technological industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest economic centre (more than 25 per cent of total government revenue) within the state and are larger than agriculture, forestry and mining combined."
5283,11,idaho,5283,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Idaho population was 1,787,065 as of 1 July 2018, an increase of 14% since 2010."
5284,11,idaho,5284,"The population of Idaho was estimated at 1,754,208 in 2018, an increase of 37,265 over the previous year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010."
5285,11,idaho,5285," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to the net migration of 75,795 people to the state."
5286,11,idaho,5286, There are many English and German Americans in Idaho.
5287,11,idaho,5287,"Immigration from outside the United States has resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people and internal migration has resulted in a net increase of 61,273 people."
5288,11,idaho,5288,"For example, Idaho was the tenth fastest growing state after the District of Columbia (+16.74%), Utah (+14.37%), Texas (+14.14%), Florida (+13.29%), Colorado (+13.25%), North Dakota (+13.01 %), Nevada (+12.36%), Arizona (+12.20%) and Washington."
5289,11,idaho,5289," From 2017 to 2018, the Idaho was the second fastest, surpassed only by Nevada."
5290,11,idaho,5290,"Nampa, approximately 30 km west of downtown Boise, became the second largest city in the state in the late 1990s, passing through Pocatello and Idaho Falls."
5291,11,idaho,5291,"The population of Nampa was less than 29,000 in 1990 and had risen to more than 81,000 in 2010."
5292,11,idaho,5292," Located between Nampa and Boise, Meridian has also experienced strong growth from less than 10,000 residents in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now the third largest city in Idaho."
5293,11,idaho,5293," Growth of 5% or more over the same period was also observed in Caldwell, Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls, and Twin Falls."
5294,11,idaho,5294," From 1990 to 2010, the population of Idaho increased by more than 560,000 (55%)."
5295,11,idaho,5295,"The metropolitan area of Boise (officially known as Boise City-Nampa, Metropolitan Statistics Region ID) is the largest metropolitan area in Idaho."
5296,11,idaho,5296," Other metropolitan areas in order of size are Heart of Alène, Idaho Falls, Pocatello and Lewiston."
5297,11,idaho,5297,The following table shows the racial composition of the Idaho population from 2016.
5298,11,idaho,5298," According to the 2017 U.S. Community Survey, 12.2% of the population of Idaho were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (10.6%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.1%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (1.3%)."
5299,11,idaho,5299,"The five most important ancestry groups are German (17.5%), English (16.4%), Irish (9.3%), American (8.1%) and Scots (3.2%)."
5300,11,idaho,5300,"Note: The births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnic origin and race, giving a higher overall number."
5301,11,idaho,5301," According to the Pew Research Center on Religion & Public Life, the self-identified religious affiliations of Idahoans over 18 years of age in 2008 and 2014 were:"
5302,11,idaho,5302," According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest denominations according to the number of members in 2010 were the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Days Saints with 409 265, the Catholic Church with 123 400, the Evangelical Protestant with 62 637, and the Assemblies of God with 22,183."
5303,11,idaho,5303,English is the main language of the state.
5304,11,idaho,5304, Minority languages include Spanish and different Amerindian languages.
5305,11,idaho,5305,"The 2015 gross domestic product was $64.9 billion, and per capita income based on 2015 GDP and 2015 population estimates was $39,100."
5306,11,idaho,5306,Idaho is an important agricultural state that produces nearly one third of the potatoes grown in the United States.
5307,11,idaho,5307,"The three varieties of wheat, dark northern spring, hard red and soft white are grown in the state."
5308,11,idaho,5308,The County of Nez Perce is considered a prime soft white growth site.
5309,11,idaho,5309,"Idaho's main industries are food processing, lumber and wood products, machinery, chemicals, paper products, electronic manufacturing, money and other extractive industries, and tourism."
5310,11,idaho,5310,"The largest mill in the world for barrel cheese, the raw product for processed cheese is in Gooding, Idaho."
5311,11,idaho,5311,"It has a capacity of 120,000 metric tons per year of cheese in barrels and belongs to the Glanbia group."
5312,11,idaho,5312,The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is the largest installation in the country's energy department by region.
5313,11,idaho,5313,INL is an important part of the Eastern Idaho economy.
5314,11,idaho,5314,Idaho also houses three facilities in Anheuser-Busch that provide much of the malt for breweries across the country.
5315,11,idaho,5315,A range of industries are important.
5316,11,idaho,5316," Outdoor recreation is a common example, ranging from many snowmobile, downhill and cross-country ski resorts in winter to Lewiston's evolution as a retreat community based on mild winters, a dry and year-round climate and one of the lowest midwind speeds everywhere, combined with rivers for a wide variety of activities."
5317,11,idaho,5317," Other examples would be ATK, which operates three munitions and ammunition components plants in Lewiston."
5318,11,idaho,5318, Two are sports and one is a defence contract.
5319,11,idaho,5319,"The Lewis-Clark Valley has another independent ammunition component manufacturer and the Chipmunk rifle factory until it was purchased in 2007 by Keystone Sporting Arms and production moved to Milton, Pennsylvania."
5320,11,idaho,5320,"Four of the six world-wide manufacturers of welded aluminum reaction vessels (for river rapids) are located in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley, WA."
5321,11,idaho,5321, Wine grapes were grown between Kendrick and Juliaetta in the Idaho Panhandle by the French Rothschild until the ban.
5322,11,idaho,5322," Similarly, although there are no large cellars or breweries in Idaho, there are a large number of award-winning cellars and microbreweries in the north of the state."
5323,11,idaho,5323," Today, the largest industry in Idaho is the science and technology sector."
5324,11,idaho,5324,It accounts for more than 25 per cent of government revenues and over 70 per cent of government exports.
5325,11,idaho,5325,"Idaho's industrial economy is developing, with high-tech products in mind."
5326,11,idaho,5326," Since the late 1970s, Boise has become a centre for the production of semiconductors."
5327,11,idaho,5327,"Boise is the home of Micron Technology, the only American manufacturer of random access dynamic chips (DRAM)."
5328,11,idaho,5328,"Micron both manufactured desktop computers, but with very limited success."
5329,11,idaho,5329,"Hewlett-Packard has operated a large plant in Boise since the 1970s, primarily dedicated to the production of LaserJet printers."

5333,11,idaho,5333,Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation) has two offices in Boise and a coin repository in Pocatello.
5334,11,idaho,5334,Sun earns $4 million in annual salaries and over $300 million in revenue to the Crown each year.
5335,11,idaho,5335,"A number of Fortune 500 companies began to establish or trace their roots in Idaho, including Safeway in American Falls, Alberts in Boise, JR Simplot across southern Idaho and Potlatch Corp. in Lewiston."
5336,11,idaho,5336,"Zimmerly Air Transport in Lewiston-Clarkston was one of five companies in the merger centered around Varney Air Lines from Pasco, Washington, which became United Airlines and then Varney Air Group which became Continental Airlines."
5337,11,idaho,5337,"In 2014, Idaho became the second most favourable state for small businesses, ranking behind Utah, based on data from over 12,000 small business owners."
5338,11,idaho,5338,Idaho has a gambling lottery that contributed $333.5 million to all public schools and higher education in Idaho from 1990 to 2006.
5339,11,idaho,5339,The tax is collected by the Idaho State Tax Commission.
5340,11,idaho,5340,The public personal income tax varies from 1.6% to 7.8% across eight income brackets.
5341,11,idaho,5341,"The Idahoans may claim State tax credits for taxes paid to other States, as well as for donations to educational entities in the State of Idaho and to certain non-profit educational and rehabilitation institutions for young people."
5342,11,idaho,5342,The public sales tax is 6% with a very limited and selective local option of up to 6.5%.
5343,11,idaho,5343," Sales tax applies to the sale, rental or rental of tangible personal property and to certain services."
5344,11,idaho,5344,"Food is taxed, but prescription drugs are not."
5345,11,idaho,5345,"Hotels, motels and campgrounds are taxed at a higher rate (7 to 11%)."
5346,11,idaho,5346, Some jurisdictions charge a tax on sales of local options.
5347,11,idaho,5347," Sales tax was introduced at 3% in 1965, easily approved by voters, and remained at 3% until 1983."
5348,11,idaho,5348,"In 2017, Idaho's primary energy source was hydro, and energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatt hours (MWh)."
5349,11,idaho,5349,"In 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market, with the Idaho Utilities Commission regulating the three main utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,The energy landscape of Idaho supports the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,"The State is rich in renewable energy resources, but has limited fossil fuel resources."
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller watersheds provide Idaho with some of the country's best hydroelectric resources and geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind energy potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353, These realities shaped most of the state's energy landscape.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports the bulk of the energy it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355," Imports account for over 80% of energy consumption, including the total supply of natural gas and oil to Idaho and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"In 2005, 48% of the electricity consumed in Idaho came from hydroelectricity, 42% came from coal combustion and 9% from natural gas combustion."
5357,11,idaho,5357,"The rest comes from other renewable sources, such as wind."
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The many river basins in the state allow hydropower plants to supply 556,000 MWh, representing about three quarters of the electricity generated by Idaho in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,The state of Washington supplies most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two main gas pipeline networks that supply the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360," Although the State relies on sources external to the State for its total supply of natural gas, it uses natural gas-fired power plants to produce 127 000 MWh, or about 10 per cent of its production."
5361,11,idaho,5361, Coal production and the small range of state wind turbines feed the rest of the state's electricity production.
5362,11,idaho,5362,The state produces 739 000 MWh but still has to import half of its electricity from the outside to meet demand.
5363,11,idaho,5363," While Idaho's 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) are small compared to other states and account for only 0.5% of U.S. consumption, the state also has the country's 11th smallest population, or 1.5 million people, so that its energy consumption per capita of BTU 352 million (103 MWh) is just above the national average of BTU 333 million (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th state in terms of an area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), the distance creates the additional problem of the ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365," When the length of an electric transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electrical current passing through it is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States, with the population expected to increase by 31 per cent between 2008 and 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367," This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, which will further increase Idaho's limited hydropower resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has a higher estimate of the development potential to produce 44 320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind energy, and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar energy using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of photovoltaics on roofs, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar energy."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Department of Transport is the government agency responsible for Idaho's transport infrastructure, including operation and maintenance and planning of future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The Agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of federal funds, state funds and grants for government transportation programs."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is one of the few states in the nation without a major highway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"The United States-95 connects both ends of the state, but like many other Idaho highways, it is in great need of repairs and improvements."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Department of Transport reported that the Government's road infrastructure was facing an annual deficit of $200 million in maintenance and improvement."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main road linking the south-east and south-west parts of the State, as well as I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Main Federal Aid Routes in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"Major airports include the Boise International Airport serving the southwestern Idaho region and the Spokane International Airport (Spokane, Washington) serving northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377, Other scheduled airports include Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving the Palouse; Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and the north and west central Idaho; Magic Valley Regional Airport at Twin Falls; Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and Pocatello Regional Airport.
5378,11,idaho,5378,Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland and Spokane to the west and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"The BNSF crosses the counties of Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary."
5381,11,idaho,5381,The Union Pacific Railway crosses the North Idaho between Canada via Boundary and Bonner and goes towards Spokane.
5382,11,idaho,5382,"Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in northern Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon."
5383,11,idaho,5383,"Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses the northern Idaho, with its only stop being at Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384," Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho."
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific Railroad also crosses the southern Idaho between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,Lewiston Harbour is the farthest port from the Pacific on the west coast.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake and Columbia River facilitate the movement of barges from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded onto ocean vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,The constitution of Idaho is roughly shaped on the national constitution with several additions.
5389,11,idaho,5389,The Constitution defines the form and functions of the Government of the State and may be amended by plebiscite.
5390,11,idaho,5390,"In particular, the Constitution of the State currently requires that the Government of the State maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391,"As a result, the Idaho has a limited debt (construction bonds, etc.)"

5393,11,idaho,5393,All the laws of the State of Idaho are contained in the Idaho Code and Statute.
5394,11,idaho,5394,The code is amended by the Legislative Assembly with the approval of the Governor.
5395,11,idaho,5395,The Idaho still operates according to its original constitution (1889).
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The Idaho Constitution provides for three powers of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"The Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected in 35 legislative districts, each being represented by one senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398," Since 1946, State-wide constitutional administrators have been elected for a four-year term."
5399,11,idaho,5399," These include the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, the Idaho State Controller (prior to 1994), the Treasurer, the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Instruction."
5400,11,idaho,5400," Last challenged in 1966, the Inspector of Mines was a constitutional post originally elected."
5401,11,idaho,5401, This position was subsequently appointed and finally abolished entirely in 1974.
5402,11,idaho,5402,The Idaho government has a monopoly on alcohol.
5403,11,idaho,5403,The Governor of Idaho has a four-year term and is elected at the so-called national mid-term elections.
5404,11,idaho,5404,The Governor is therefore not elected during the same election year as the President of the United States.
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current Governor is Republican Brad Little, elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,The Idaho legislature is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407," However, the session may be extended if necessary and is often extended."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"As a result, the legislators of Idaho are considered ""citizen legislators"", which means that their position as legislator is not their main business."
5409,11,idaho,5409,The terms of office of the Senator and the House of Representatives are two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410,"The general elections are held every year, even if numbered."
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The Idaho Legislature has been permanently controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although democratic legislators are systematically elected from Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and North Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,The Idaho Supreme Court is the Idaho Supreme Court.
5413,11,idaho,5413," There is also an interim court of appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeal, which hears cases referred to it by the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The state district courts serve seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416," Since 1919, there have been 44 state counties, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 km2)."
5417,11,idaho,5417, Three counties were first designated as such by the Washington Territorial Legislative Assembly in 1861.
5418,11,idaho,5418," Since 1861, Nez Percé County has been divided into counties of Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai and Clearwater."
5419,11,idaho,5419,The Idaho licence plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county name.
5420,11,idaho,5420," When a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number is preceded by an alphabetical order."
5421,11,idaho,5421," This reflects an abnormal situation that coincides with the fact that 10 counties start with B, 7 with C and 4 with L, representing 21 of the 44 counties."
5422,11,idaho,5422," After the civil war, many democrats from the Midwest and South moved to Idaho territory."
5423,11,idaho,5423,"As a result, the first territorial legislatures were firmly controlled by the democrats."
5424,11,idaho,5424,"On the other hand, most territorial governors have been appointed by Republican presidents and have been Republicans."
5425,11,idaho,5425," This has led to sometimes bitter clashes between the two parties, including a war of scope with the Democrats supporting the shepherds and the Republicans the breeders, which ended in the trial for the murder of ""Diamondfield"" Jack Davis."
5426,11,idaho,5426,In the 1880s Republicans became more important in local politics.
5427,11,idaho,5427,"In 1864 Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and state constitution from a locked safe, and took them to Boise."
5428,11,idaho,5428," This actually moved the capital from where it was stored (Lewiston, Idaho) to the current capital, Boise."
5429,11,idaho,5429," Since the establishment of the state, the Republican Party has usually been the dominant party of Idaho."
5430,11,idaho,5430,"At one point, the Idaho had two democratic parties, one being the general public and the other called the anti-Marmon Democrats, which lasted at the beginning of the 20th century."
5431,11,idaho,5431,"In the 1890s and early 1900s, the Populist Party dominated, while the Democratic Party maintained a brief domination in the 1930s during the Great Depression."
5432,11,idaho,5432," Since the Second World War, most state-wide elected representatives have been Republicans, although the Democrats held a majority in the House (by a seat) in 1958 and in the post of Governor from 1971 to 1995."

6338,13,indiana,6338,"The following is a table of Indiana sports venues with a capacity of more than 30,000:"
6339,13,indiana,6339,Indiana had a great sporting success at the college level.
6340,13,indiana,6340,"In men's basketball, Indiana Hoosiers won five NCAA national championships and 22 Big Ten Conference championships."

6346,13,indiana,6346,"In 2017, Indiana had a civilian workforce of nearly 3.4 million, the 15th largest in American Indiana has an unemployment rate of 3.4 per cent, below the national average."
6347,13,indiana,6347,Total gross domestic product in 2016 was $347.2 billion.
6348,13,indiana,6348,A high percentage of Indiana's revenue comes from manufacturing.
6349,13,indiana,6349," According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 17 per cent of the government's non-agricultural labour force is employed in manufacturing, the highest of all states in the United States."
6350,13,indiana,6350,"The government's top five exports were motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, optical and medical equipment, and electrical machinery."
6351,13,indiana,6351," Despite its dependence on manufacturing, Indiana was less affected by the decline in traditional Rust Belt manufacturing than many of its neighbours."
6352,13,indiana,6352,The explanation appears to be a number of factors in the labour market.
6353,13,indiana,6353,"First, a large part of heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires a highly skilled workforce, and companies are often willing to find where there are already skills that are difficult to train."
6354,13,indiana,6354,"Second, Indiana's labour force is found primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolitan areas."
6355,13,indiana,6355, This allows companies to offer slightly lower wages for these skills than would normally be the case.
6356,13,indiana,6356, Businesses often see Indiana as a chance to acquire above-average skills at below-average wages.
6357,13,indiana,6357,"In 2016, Indiana hosted seven Fortune 500 companies with a combined income of $142.5 billion."

6372,13,indiana,6372,"The government's sales tax rate is 7% with exemptions for food, prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs."
6373,13,indiana,6373,"In some jurisdictions, an additional food and beverage tax is imposed at a rate of 1% (the Marion County rate is 2%), on sales of prepared meals and beverages."
6374,13,indiana,6374,Property taxes are levied on Indiana's real and personal property and are administered by the Ministry of Finance of local governments.
6375,13,indiana,6375,"Property is subject to taxation by various taxing units (schools, counties, townships, municipalities and libraries), making the total tax rate the sum of tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which property is located."
6376,13,indiana,6376," However, a ""breakwater"" law enacted on March 19, 2008, limits property tax to 1% of the assessed value for owners, 2% for rental properties and agricultural land, and 3% for businesses."
6377,13,indiana,6377,"Indiana does not have a legal obligation to balance the state budget, neither in law nor in its constitution."

6384,13,indiana,6384,"Indiana also houses the coal-fired power plant with the highest sulphur dioxide emissions in the United States, the Gallagher power plant, just west of New Albany."
6385,13,indiana,6385,"In 2010, Indiana had estimated coal reserves at 57 billion tons and public mining operations produced 35 million tons of coal per year."
6386,13,indiana,6386,"Indiana also owns at least 900 million barrels of oil reserves in the Trenton field, although they are not easy to recover."
6387,13,indiana,6387," While Indiana has committed to increasing the use of renewable resources such as wind, hydro, biomass and solar energy, progress has been very slow, mainly due to the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana."
6388,13,indiana,6388, Most of the new government facilities are coal gasification plants.
6389,13,indiana,6389, Another source is hydraulic power.
6390,13,indiana,6390,Wind power has been developed.
6391,13,indiana,6391,"In 2006, estimates increased Indiana's wind capacity from 30 MW to 50 m in height to 40,000 MW in height to 70 m and to 130,000 MW in height to 100 m in 2010."

6396,13,indiana,6396,"A long-standing proposal to make Gary Chicago International Airport the third major airport in Chicago received a boost in early 2006, with $48 million in federal funding approved over the next ten years."
6397,13,indiana,6397,"No airlines operate from the Terre Haute regional airport, but it is used for private aircraft."
6398,13,indiana,6398," Since 1954, 181 Wing of the Indian National Air Guard has been stationed there, but the 2005 Realignment and Closure Base (BRAC) proposal indicated that the 181st would lose its fighter mission and the F-16 aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility with a combat aircraft facility."

6403,13,indiana,6403, There are also many U.S. highways and state highways maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
6404,13,indiana,6404, They are numbered under the same convention as the United States.
6405,13,indiana,6405,Motorways.
6406,13,indiana,6406,Indiana allows highways with different classifications to have the same number.
6407,13,indiana,6407,"For example, I-64 and Indiana State Road 64 both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two separate roads without any relationship between them."

6411,13,indiana,6411," Once finished, I-69 will cross 142 additional miles (229 km) across the state."
6412,13,indiana,6412," Most Indiana counties use a network-based system to identify county roads; this system has replaced the old arbitrary system of numbers and road names, and (among other things) it is much easier to identify the call sources placed in the 9-1-1 system."
6413,13,indiana,6413, These systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central parts of the state.
6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on non-systematic road names (e.g. Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott and Washington counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415, There are also counties in the northern regions of the state that have never set up a grid or implemented only part of it.
6416,13,indiana,6416," Some counties are also located in a grid system that is almost similar to that of diamonds (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson and Knox counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417, Such a system is also almost useless in these situations too.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"One day, Knox County used two different network systems for county roads because the county was built using two different surveying systems, but it has since decided to use road names and to combine roads instead."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"In particular, the road network of St. Joseph County, whose main city is South Bend, uses the names of perennial trees (i.e., the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, the name of the tree, and the name of the tree."

6422,13,indiana,6422, alphabetically for East-West roads.

7898,17,louisiana,7898,"At the time, the French had also built a small fort at the mouth of Mississippi in an establishment they called La Balise (or La Balize), ""marque de mer"" in French."
7899,17,louisiana,7899,In 1721 they built a 19-metre wooden lighthouse structure to guide the ships on the river.
7900,17,louisiana,7900,A Royal Order of 1722 – following the Crown's transfer of the governance of Illinois country from Canada to Louisiana – may have provided the broadest definition of Louisiana: all the lands claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies.
7901,17,louisiana,7901,"A generation later, trade disputes between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745 the Governor General of Louisiana, Vaudreuil, fixed the northern and eastern boundaries of his estate, such as the Wabash Valley, to the mouth of the Vermilion River (almost today Danville, Illinois); thence from the northwest to the Rock on the Illinois River, and thence west to the mouth of the Rock River (now Rock Island, Illinois)."
7902,17,louisiana,7902,"For example, Vincennes and Peoria were the limits of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (in the upper Wabash near Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (nearly today Fort Wayne, Indiana) and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada."
7903,17,louisiana,7903,"The colony of Natchitoches (long of the Red River in the present northwest of Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau of St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana."
7904,17,louisiana,7904,"The French establishment had two objectives: to establish exchanges with the Spanish in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances in Louisiana."
7905,17,louisiana,7905,"The colony soon became a flourishing river port and a crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were exploited by imported African slaves."
7906,17,louisiana,7906,"In time, planters have developed large plantations and built beautiful houses in a growing city."
7907,17,louisiana,7907," This has become a repeated model in New Orleans and other places, although the cultivation of commodities in the south was mainly sugar cane."
7908,17,louisiana,7908,"The French colonies of Louisiana contributed to exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of Mississippi and its main tributaries, from Louisiana to the north of the area known as Illinois, around St. Louis, now Missouri."
7909,17,louisiana,7909,He was colonized by French settlers from Illinois.
7910,17,louisiana,7910," Initially, Mobile then Biloxi served as the capital of La Louisiana."
7911,17,louisiana,7911," Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River for trade and military interests, and wishing to protect the capital from strong coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civil and military authority in the south of the Great Lakes."
7912,17,louisiana,7912," From then on, until the United States acquired territory in Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and lands west of Mississippi."
7913,17,louisiana,7913,"In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi, in an area called the German coast."
7914,17,louisiana,7914,"France ceded most of its territory east of Mississippi to Britain in 1763, after Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War (generally called the French and Indian War in North America)."
7915,17,louisiana,7915,"The rest of Louisiana, including the New Orleans region and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, had become a colony of Spain under the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)."
7916,17,louisiana,7916,The transfer of power on each side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.
7917,17,louisiana,7917,"In 1765, during Spanish domination, several thousand Francophone refugees from the Acadia region (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada) travelled to Louisiana after being expelled from their homeland by the British during the French and Indian War."
7918,17,louisiana,7918," They settled mainly in the southwest region of Louisiana, now known as Acadiana."
7919,17,louisiana,7919," Governor Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, eager to win more settlers, welcomed the Acadian refugees, the ancestors of the Cajuns of Louisiana."
7920,17,louisiana,7920,"The Spanish Canary Islands, known as Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783."
7921,17,louisiana,7921,"In 1800, the Frenchman Napoleon Bonaparte took over Louisiana from Spain in the treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years."
7922,17,louisiana,7922,"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony to the West Indies."
7923,17,louisiana,7923,"In 1709 the French financier Antoine Crozat obtained the monopoly of trade in La Louisiana, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois."
7924,17,louisiana,7924,"""This concession allowed him to bring an annual shipment of African blacks,"" writes British historian Hugh Thomas."
7925,17,louisiana,7925," Physical conditions, including illness, were so harsh that there was high mortality among both settlers and slaves, resulting in continued demand and import of slaves."
7926,17,louisiana,7926," Starting in 1719, traders began importing more slaves; two French ships, Du Maine and Aurore, arrived in New Orleans, carrying more than 500 black slaves from Africa."
7927,17,louisiana,7927, Louisiana's former slaves had been transported from the French colonies in the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721 New Orleans had 1,256 inhabitants, approximately half of whom were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724, the French government published a law called the Code Noir (""Code Noir"" in English) which ""regulates the interaction of white [white] and black [black] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much greater than the present state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law included 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, prohibited ""interracial"" marriages (those between persons of different skin colour, whose varying nuances were also defined by law), restricted the Manumission, described the legal penalties imposed on slaves for various offences and defined certain obligations of owners towards their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main objective of the French government was to assert control over the system of agricultural slavery in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on the owners of slaves.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Black Code was extremely difficult to enforce from afar."
7933,17,louisiana,7933," Some priests continued to perform interracial wedding ceremonies, for example, and some slave owners continued to manipulate slaves without permission, while others brutally punished slaves."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Black Code of 1724 obliges the owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935, Sunday was to be a day of rest for the slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On days off, slaves were expected to feed themselves and take care of themselves."
7937,17,louisiana,7937," During the economic crisis of the 1740s in the colony, the owners struggled to feed their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938," Giving them free time also gave more power to the slaves, who began to grow their own gardens and make items for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939," They started to participate in the economic development of the colony, while increasing independence and self-subsistence."
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Black Code prohibits mixed marriages, prohibits mixed marriages, but hardly protects women slaves from the rape of their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941," Overall, the Code benefits the owners, but has more protections and flexibility than the establishment of slavery in the 13 southern colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were rarely prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"Fugitive slaves, called marons, could easily hide in the bay's hinterland and survive in small colonies."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maroon"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", i.e. ""fugal cattle""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"At the end of the 18th century, the last Spanish governor of Louisiana territory wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946," When the United States purchased Louisiana in 1803, it was quickly accepted that African slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighbouring Mississippi, although it violated American law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947," Despite the demands of Rep. James Hillhouse of the United States and the brochure Thomas Paine to enforce the federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the cheapest labour."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small sugar producer with a relatively small number of slaves compared to Santo Domingo and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949," Soon after, she became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations."
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, the first American governor of Louisiana, stated that the work of African slaves was necessary because white workers ""can't have in this unhealthy climate."""
7951,17,louisiana,7951," Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to impose the abolition of the slave trade in Africa, which the United States and Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastal trade, the shipping of slaves along the Atlantic coast, and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"In 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the United States, making a major contribution to the economy of the city and the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,New Orleans became one of the richest cities and the third largest city in the country.
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and the importation of slaves has increased demand in the internal market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"Over the decades since the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved Africans have been forced to migrate from the Upper South to the deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957, Others were transported by their owners as slave owners moved westward for new lands.
7958,17,louisiana,7958," With the change in agriculture in the Upper South as planters moved from tobacco to less labour intensive mixed farming, planters had surplus workers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959, Many sold slaves to traders to take them to the deep south.
7960,17,louisiana,7960, Slaves were driven by Upper South traders or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by boat as part of the slave trade on the coast.
7961,17,louisiana,7961," After sales to New Orleans, steamboats operating on Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations in Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,The Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963," From the 1790s onwards, waves of immigration took place in Santo Domingo, following a slave rebellion that began in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants have landed from the island in Louisiana, including ethnic Europeans, people of free colour and African slaves, some of whom are brought by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965," They have greatly increased the French-speaking population of New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and slaves have strengthened African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The process of independence in Santo Domingo is complex, but the uprisings continue."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803, France withdrew its surviving troops from the island, after having suffered the loss of two thirds sent to the island two years earlier, mainly with yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic of the Western Hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, carried out by the slave leaders."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) said: ""Saint-Domingue is, of all our colonies in the West Indies, the one whose mentality and customs have most influenced Louisiana."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970," When the United States gained independence from Britain in 1783, one of its main concerns was to have a European power at its western border and the need for unlimited access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As American settlers pushed west, they found the Appalachians to be an obstacle to the eastward movement of goods."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship the goods was to use a flat boat to float it in Ohio and Mississippi to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be placed on ocean vessels."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this road was that the Spaniards had both sides of the Mississippi below Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974, Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana imply the creation of a new empire focused on the Caribbean sugar trade.
7975,17,louisiana,7975," Under the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain referred to the French for ownership of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe."
7976,17,louisiana,7976," Napoleon considered Louisiana as a deposit for these sugar islands, and as a buffer for American colonization."
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a great military force to resume Santo Domingo, then under the control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.When Napoleon Leclerc's brother-in-law's army was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish the French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979," With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could at any time close the Mississippi to the American trade."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, American minister in France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, parts of the east shore of Mississippi, and the free navigation of the river for American trade."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston has been allowed to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer from Louisiana to the French property had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's transaction with the Spaniards was a poorly guarded secret on the border."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, announced Spain's intention to revoke the right of deposit in New Orleans for any cargo originating in the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,"In the west, trade was practically blocked."
7986,17,louisiana,7986," Historians believe that the revocation of the right of deposit was caused by the abuses committed by the Americans, in particular by smuggling, and not by the French intrigues, as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987," President Jefferson ignored public pressure for the war with France, and appointed James Monroe as Special Envoy to Napoleon, to help secure New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson also increased authorized expenditures to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989," However, on April 11, 1803 French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how willing the United States was to pay for the whole of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered it)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon could withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them without being able to get the desired area of New Orleans), and that President Jefferson's approval could take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open the negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"As of April 30, they entered into a transaction for the purchase of the entire territory of Louisiana of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for 60 million francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,Part of that $3.5 million was used to cancel France's debts to the United States.
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in US bonds, which Napoleon sold in nominal value to the Dutch company Hope and Company, and the British bank house of Baring, at a discount of $87 1⁄2 per unit of $100."
7994,17,louisiana,7994,"As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"English banker Alexander Baring confided Marbois in Paris, fled to the United States to recover the bonds, took them to Great Britain and returned to France with the money Napoleon was waging war against his own country."
7996,17,louisiana,7996," When the news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,He had authorized an expenditure of $10 million for a port city and received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a set of lands that would double the size of the country.
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents in the federalist party argued that the purchase in Louisiana was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or the negotiation of treaties without the consent of the senator."
7999,17,louisiana,7999," What really worries the opposition is the new states that will inevitably be cut off from Louisiana territory, reinforcing Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England's federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000, President Jefferson was a strong supporter of westward expansion and was firm in his support of the treaty.
8001,17,louisiana,8001," Despite federalist objections, the U.S. senator ratified the Treaty of Louisiana on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002,By law promulgated on 31 October 1803 President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories transferred by France and to provide for initial governance.
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony took place in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004," Since the territory of Louisiana had never been officially handed over to the French, the Spaniards removed their flag and the French lifted their flag."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,The next day General James Wilkinson accepted the possession of New Orleans for the United States.
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony took place in Saint-Louis on 9 March 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The next day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the first United States of America"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,The artillery marched its troops in the city and drove the American flag to the mast of the fort.
8009,17,louisiana,8009," Louisiana territory is officially transferred to the Government of the United States, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010," Louisiana's territory, purchased for less than three hundred per acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and created a precedent for the purchase of territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It paved the way for the expansion of the United States throughout the continent towards the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012," Shortly after the seizure of possession of the United States, the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on 26 March 1804, thus organizing the territory of Orleans to the south and the district of Louisiana (which then formed like the territory of Louisiana) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013," Louisiana became the eighteenth state of the United States on April 30, 1812; the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana and the territory of Louisiana was simultaneously renamed the territory of Missouri."
8014,17,louisiana,8014,An area known as Florida Parishes was soon annexed to the state of Louisiana on 14 April 1812.
8015,17,louisiana,8015," From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a two-party system, with the Democrats fighting first with the Whigs, then with the Know Nothings, and finally with the Democrats alone."
8016,17,louisiana,8016," According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, or almost 47 per cent of the total population of the State (708,002)."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,"The strong economic interest of the elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to separate from the Union on January 26, 1861."
8018,17,louisiana,8018,He followed other southern states in secession following the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019,"The secession of Louisiana was announced on January 26, 1861, and was part of the Confederate States of America."
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated in the civil war, the result of the Union's strategy to cut Confederation into two by seizing Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,"The federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862."
8022,17,louisiana,8022,"As a large part of the population had sympathy from the Union (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the Federally-controlled Louisiana areas as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives in the US Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023,"As a result of the civil war and the emancipation of slaves, violence intensified in the South as the war was waged by insurgent private and paramilitary groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024," Initially, the state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who adopted black codes to regulate free men and generally refused to vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025, They refused to extend the right to vote to African-Americans who had been free before the war and who had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).
8026,17,louisiana,8026," Following the Memphis riots of 1866 and the riot in New Orleans that same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted which provided the vote and full citizenship for the liberated men."
8027,17,louisiana,8027," Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, creating military districts for states where conditions were considered to be the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,He was regrouped with Texas in what was administered as the fifth military district.
8029,17,louisiana,8029, African-Americans began to live as citizens with some equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030,"Free men and persons of colour who had been free before the war began to make more progress in education, family stability and employment."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was huge social volatility in the aftermath of the war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labour market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in Ku Klux Klan chapters."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"In 1877, when the federal forces were withdrawn, the white democrats of Louisiana and other states regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which removed the black vote through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034,"In accordance with the example of Mississippi in 1890, in 1898, the white, democratic legislature, dominated by planters, adopted a new constitution that effectively deprived people of colour of their voting rights, raising obstacles to voter registration, such as voting taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect is immediate and durable.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896 there were 130,334 black voters on the lists of electors and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the population of the State, which was also divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"In 1900, the population of the state was 47% African-American, a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038," Many in New Orleans were descendants of Colour Creoles, the large population of colour free people before the civil war."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"In 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the State."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"In 1910, there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5% of eligible African American men), despite the progress made in education and literacy among blacks and people of colour."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve in juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"The White Democrats established a one-party democratic regime, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until, after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by Congress, the federal government monitored and enforced the constitutional right to vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration northward to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,The infestation of the plow and agricultural problems have cost many farmers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,Mechanization of agriculture also reduces the need for workers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046," Starting in the 1940s, Blacks went to California for jobs in its expanding defence industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047,"For part of the Great Depression, Louisiana was led by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected for a populist call.
8049,17,louisiana,8049," His public works projects provided thousands of jobs for people in need, and he supported education and increased the vote for the poor whites, but Long was criticized for his supposedly demagogical and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He extended the control of favouritism to all branches of the Louisiana state government.
8051,17,louisiana,8051, His plans for redistribution of wealth in the state were particularly controversial.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule came to an abrupt end when he was murdered in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,The mobilization for the Second World War created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,But thousands of other black and white workers have migrated to California for better jobs in its burgeoning defence industry.
8055,17,louisiana,8055," Many African-Americans left the state during the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s to the 1960s, to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanisation of agriculture in the 1930s had greatly reduced the need for workers.
8057,17,louisiana,8057," They were looking for specialized jobs in the defence industry in California, for better education for their children, and lived in communities where they could vote."

8061,17,louisiana,8061," Despite opposition from the State Rights Party, low-state black voters have begun to increase their enrolment rates, which also reflects the growth of their middle classes."
8062,17,louisiana,8062,"In 1960, the state established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation."
8063,17,louisiana,8063," Despite this, the registration and turnout of black voters has gradually increased to 20 per cent or more, and it was 32 per cent in 1964, when the first national legislation on civil rights at the time was adopted."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"The percentage of black voters varied widely in those years, from 93.8% in the evangelical parish to 1.7% in the parish of Tensas, for example, where there were white efforts to suppress the vote in the parish with a black majority."
8065,17,louisiana,8065,"The violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill cities were catalysts for the creation of the first two chapters of the Deacons of Defence and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, respectively, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa."

8073,17,louisiana,8073,"On the basis of official census figures, in 1970 the African-American population stood at 1,085,109 persons, a net gain of more than 46,000 persons compared to 1960."
8074,17,louisiana,8074," During the latter period, some people began to migrate to New South cities to find opportunities."

8080,17,louisiana,8080,It caused considerable damage due to the breakage of dykes and large-scale flooding of more than 80 per cent of the city.
8081,17,louisiana,8081," Officials have issued warnings to evacuate the city and surrounding areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, have remained behind, many of whom have remained blocked."

8091,17,louisiana,8091, Louisiana entered the first phase of the reopening of the state on 15 May.
8092,17,louisiana,8092,"On June 4, Governor John Bel Edwards signed an order that moved to the second phase."
8093,17,louisiana,8093, That's government.
8094,17,louisiana,8094,"Edwards extended the second phase until September 11, and the third phase began with speculation on October 9."
8095,17,louisiana,8095, Louisiana is bordered west by Texas
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The condition can be well divided into two parts, the northern highlands, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial region includes low marshlands, coastal marshes and beaches, and barrier islands that cover approximately 20,000 square miles (32,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098," This area is mainly along the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi, which crosses the state from north to south about 600 mi (970 km) and flows into the Gulf of Mexico; the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The width of the alluvial region along Mississippi is 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100 km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region has an average of about 10 miles (15 km) on the other side."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as leve), from which the lands decline to a river beyond an average fall of six feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,Alluvial lands along other watercourses have similar characteristics.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The higher and contiguous hills of the north and north-western parts of the state have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103, They are made up of meadows and wood.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3 m) on the coast and marshy lands to 50–60 feet (15–18 m) on grasslands and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the highlands and hills, elevations reach Mount Driskill, the highest point of the state at only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106," From 1932 to 2010, the State lost 1,800 square miles due to rising sea levels and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,"The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CCRA) spends approximately $1 billion annually to assist in the establishment and protection of the shores and lands of Louisiana, both at the federal and state levels."
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"In addition to the previously named rivers, there are the Sabine River, which forms the western boundary; and the Pearl River, the eastern boundary; the Calcasieu River, the Mermentau River, the Vermilion River, the Bayou Teche, the Atchafalaya, the Boeuf River, the Bayou Lafourche River, the Courtableau River, the Bayou D'Arbonne River, the Macon River, the Tensas River, the Amite River, the Tchefuncte River, the Tickfaw River, the Natalbany River, and a number of other smaller rivers, constituting a natural network of navigable rivers, more than 6,400 km long."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The State also has political jurisdiction over the portion of approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) of underwater land on the inland continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110," Thanks to a particular feature of the political geography of the United States, it is a territory far less than the 14-kilometre-wide jurisdiction of the neighbouring states of Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have vast coasts of the Gulf."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is one of the fastest extinct regions in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112, This is largely due to man-made mismanagement of the coast (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one point, the land was added at a time when spring flooding of the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated the growth of the marshes."
8114,17,louisiana,8114, There are many reasons.
8115,17,louisiana,8115, Artificial dikes block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to the marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"The marshes have been widely exploited, leaving canals and ditches that allow saltwater to move inward."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move seawater inland, where it damages swamps and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,The rise of seawater has aggravated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119, Some researchers estimate that the state loses a mass of ground equivalent to 30 football fields every day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120," Many proposals aim to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including the restoration of the natural floods in Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121,"In the absence of such a restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as communities disappear, more and more people leave the area."
8123,17,louisiana,8123," Since coastal wetlands support an economically significant inshore fishery, the loss of wetlands has a negative impact on this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,"The Gulf of Mexico ""dead zone"" off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States."
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"In 2017, it stood at 32,730 km2 and was the largest ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico didn't exist 250 million years ago when there was only one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As the Pangea separates, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico open."
8128,17,louisiana,8128," Louisiana developed slowly, for millions of years, from water to land and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,"The oldest rocks are exposed in the north, in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest."
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date back to the early cenozoic era, some 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,The history of the formation of these rocks is found in D. Speaking's Roadside Geology of Louisiana.
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest regions of the state have been formed over the past 12,000 years as successive Mississippi deltas: Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, modern Mississippi, and now Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133,The sediments were transported from north to south through the Mississippi River.
8134,17,louisiana,8134," Between the tertiary rocks of the north, and the relatively new sediments along the coast, there is a large belt known as Terrasses du Pleistocene."
8135,17,louisiana,8135, Their age and distribution can be largely related to rising and falling sea levels in the late ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had enough time for rivers to cut deep canals, while the more recent terraces tend to be much more flattered."
8137,17,louisiana,8137, There are also salt domes in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138, Their origin dates back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean experienced high rates of evaporation.
8139,17,louisiana,8139," There are several hundred salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140, Salt domes are not only a source of salt.
8141,17,louisiana,8141," Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long, warm, wet summers and short, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, its low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which, at its furthest point, is not more than 200 mi (320 km)."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rains are common throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the wet season of the state."
8144,17,louisiana,8144, There is an immersion in precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, thunderstorms are built during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief tropical precipitation."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In winter, the rainfall is more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June to September, with an average of 90°F (32°C) or higher, and night lows above 70°F (21°C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148," Sometimes temperatures in the 90's F, combined with dew points in the 70's F higher, create sensitive temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The wet, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and films."
8150,17,louisiana,8150,"The temperatures are generally warm in winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico on average 66°F (19°C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the state is slightly cold in winter, with mean levels of 59°F (15°C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152," Low nights in winter averaged well above freezing in the state as a whole, with 46°F (8°C) average near the Gulf and an average low of 37°F (3°C) in winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153," Occasionally, the cold fronts of low pressure centres in the north reach Louisiana in winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154," Low temperatures near 20°F (−7°C) sometimes occur in the northern part of the state, but rarely in the southern part of the state."
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents of northern parts of the state can receive snow dust a few times a decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"The highest recorded temperature in Louisiana is 114°F (46°C) in Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is −16°F (−27°C) in Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157," Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to major hurricane strikes, particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can cause damage to water through a large area of major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The region is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state is on average more than 60 days of thunderstorms per year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161, Louisiana has a yearly average of 27 tornadoes.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado, with the extreme south of the state a little less than the rest of the state."
8163,17,louisiana,8163," tornadoes are more common in the southern part of the State from January to March, and in the northern part of the State from February to March."
8164,17,louisiana,8164," Because of its location and geology, the state has a great biodiversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165," Some vital areas, such as the southwest prairie, experienced a loss of more than 98 per cent."
8166,17,louisiana,8166," Flat pines are also very threatened, mainly by fire extinguishing and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167, There is not yet a well-organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168," Such a system would consist of a protected system of basic areas connected through biological corridors, as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169," Louisiana contains a number of areas that, to varying degrees, prevent people from using it."
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to the service areas of the national parks and a national forest in the United States, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, a state conservation area, a state forest and many wildlife management areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of the largest public areas of Louisiana is the Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172," There are approximately 600,000 acres of land, more than half of which are flat forests, home to many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173, These include the Louisiana Snake and the red peacock peak.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The government-owned cypress swamp system around Pontchartrain Lake is another large area, with southern wetland species, including scratches, alligators and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 base areas would be required to construct a ""protected area system"" for the state; these would be southwestern grasslands, the Pearl River floodplain to the east, and alluvial marshes from Mississippi to the north."
8176,17,louisiana,8176," Historical or picturesque areas managed, protected or otherwise recognized by the National Parks Service include:"
8177,17,louisiana,8177," Louisiana operates a network of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and a state preservation area."
8178,17,louisiana,8178," Louisiana has 955,973 acres in four ecoregions under wildlife management by the Louisiana Ministry of Wildlife and Fisheries."
8179,17,louisiana,8179,The Nature Conservancy also owns and manages a range of natural areas.
8180,17,louisiana,8180,"The Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System provides a degree of protection for 51 state rivers, streams and bayous rivers."
8181,17,louisiana,8181,It is administered by the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Department.
8182,17,louisiana,8182," Louisiana has 308 incorporated municipalities, consisting of four consolidated parish cities and 304 cities, towns and villages."
8183,17,louisiana,8183," Louisiana's municipalities cover only 7.9 per cent of the state's land, but account for 45.3 per cent of its population."
8184,17,louisiana,8184,The majority of urban Louisianans live on the coast or in northern Louisiana.

8207,17,louisiana,8207,"Up from the 2010 and 2014 censuses, Hispanics or Latinos of any race accounted for 5.1% of Louisiana's population in 2018."
8208,17,louisiana,8208," Mexicans (2.0%), Puerto Ricans (0.3%) and Cubans (0.2%) were the largest in Latin America."

8216,17,louisiana,8216," Because of the French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and the Greater New Orleans region are mainly Catholics."
8217,17,louisiana,8217," Since Creoles were the first settlers, planters and rulers of the Territory, they had traditionally been well represented in politics."
8218,17,louisiana,8218," Thus, most of the early governors were Creole Catholics."
8219,17,louisiana,8219," Because Catholics still constitute a significant portion of Louisiana's population, they have continued to be influential in state policy."

8278,17,louisiana,8278," Louisiana is the home of many, particularly notable are the culture distinct from the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of colour, descendants of mixed free families of the colonial period and early state."
8279,17,louisiana,8279,The French colony of Louisiana struggled for decades to survive.
8280,17,louisiana,8280,"The conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were not suitable for certain crops known to settlers, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281, Both the colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"Settlers continued to import slaves, resulting in a high proportion of West Africans who continued to practice their culture in a new environment."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall describes, they developed an African-Creole culture marked in colonial times."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a significant influx of white and Métis refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285," This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in Santo Domingo were from Africa than in the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286," They have strongly influenced the city's Afro-American culture with regard to dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is a fusion of French, African, Spanish (and other European) and Native American cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word crioulo; originally, it referred to a colonist of European origin (especially French) born in the New World, compared to immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289," Louisiana's earliest manuscript to use the word ""Creole"" from 1782 applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,But originally it referred more generally to French settlers born in Louisiana.
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, a relatively large group of Creoles de Couleur (free-coloured people) developed in the French colony, mainly descended from African slaves and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mixture, as well as some Amerindians)."
8292,17,louisiana,8292,"The French often freed their concubines and Métis children, and passed on social capital to them."
8293,17,louisiana,8293,"For example, they can educate sons in France and help them enter the French army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294, They also placed property or possessions on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295,People free of colour gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education
8296,17,louisiana,8296, Many have become artisans and property owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""creole"" has become associated with this class of coloured creoles, many of which reached freedom long before the civil war."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,Rich French Creoles generally maintained homes in New Orleans as well as homes on their large sugar plantations outside the city along the Mississippi River.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans has the largest population of people of free colour in the region; they can find work there and create their own culture, marrying each other for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"Cajuns' ancestors immigrated mainly from the west-central part of France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally known as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301," After the British defeat of France in the War of France and India (Seven Years' War) in 1763, France gave up its territory east of Mississippi in Great Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated the families and expelled them from Acadia because they refused to devote loyalty to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304," Some, who escaped from the British, stayed in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305," Others are scattered in France, Canada, Mexico or the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306, Many Acadian refugees have settled in southern Louisiana in the Lafayette region and in the country of LaFourche Bayou.
8307,17,louisiana,8307," They developed a separate rural culture, different from the Creole settlers of New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"By marrying others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cooking and culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309," Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered a bit derogating."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,A third culture distinct from Louisiana is that of the Isleños.
8311,17,louisiana,8311," Its members were descendants of settlers from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and married other communities such as the French, Acadians, Creoles, Spaniards and other groups, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, Isleños originally settled in four communities including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313," Among these settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most prosperous, the other two suffering from disease and flooding."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,"The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community, while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) was able to retain much of its unique culture and language in the 21st century."
8315,17,louisiana,8315," That being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs completely stopped in St. Bernard with those who have competence in Spanish being octagenary."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Over the centuries, the different communities of Isleño de Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canaries heritage while adopting and relying on the customs and traditions of the communities around them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317," Today, two heritage partners exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard and the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana."
8318,17,louisiana,8318,"The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated each year in the parish of Saint-Bernard, which presents heritage performances by local groups and the Canary Islands."
8319,17,louisiana,8319," According to a 2010 study by the Association des langues modernes, among people aged five and over, 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% French (standard French, French Creole or French Cajun), 3.30% Spanish and 0.59% Vietnamese."
8320,17,louisiana,8320," Historically, the Amerindian peoples of the region at the time of the European meeting were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321,"Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have live native speakers, although several other tribes work to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322," Other American indigenous peoples have migrated to the region, escaping from the European pressure in the east."
8323,17,louisiana,8323," Among these were the Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati and Ofo peoples."
8324,17,louisiana,8324,"As early as the 1700s, the French settlers began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans."
8325,17,louisiana,8325, They created French cultural and linguistic institutions.
8326,17,louisiana,8326," They import thousands of slaves from the tribes of West Africa, who speak several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the process of Creolization, the slaves developed a Creole dialect of Louisiana incorporating both French and African forms, which the settlers adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, in particular, who spoke the French Creole Louisiana."
8329,17,louisiana,8329," During the 19th century after the purchase of Louisiana by the United States, English gradually gained importance for business and government due to the evolution of the population with the establishment by many Americans who were English-speaking."
8330,17,louisiana,8330, Many French-born families continued to use French in private.
8331,17,louisiana,8331,The slaves and a few people of free colour also spoke the Creole French of Louisiana.
8332,17,louisiana,8332,"The Constitution of the State of 1812 gives an official status to English in judicial proceedings, but the use of French remains widespread."
8333,17,louisiana,8333,The subsequent constitutions of the state reflect the decreasing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The 1868 Constitution, adopted at the time of reconstruction prior to the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, prohibits laws requiring the publication of judicial proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335," Subsequently, the legal status of the French recovered somewhat, but he never regained his reputation before the civil war."
8336,17,louisiana,8336," Several dialects in French, Creole and English are spoken in Louisiana."

8338,17,louisiana,8338, Louisiana Creole French is the term for one of Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339," Two unique dialects developed from the English language: Louisiana English, a variety of English with French influence in which the fall of /r/ postvocalism is common; and what is unofficially known as Yat, which resembles the New York City dialect sometimes with southern influences, especially that of historic Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340," Both accents were influenced by large communities of Irish and Italian immigrants, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341, Colonial French was the dominant language of the white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period.
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, the Métis people and slaves developed Louisiana Creole, with a base in West African languages."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish domination at the end of the 18th century did not give rise to the widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"The French Creole and Louisiana are still used in modern Louisiana, often in family gatherings."
8345,17,louisiana,8345,"English and its associated dialects became predominant after the Louisiana purchase of 1803, after which the region became dominated by many Anglophones."
8346,17,louisiana,8346,"In some regions, English has been influenced by French, as we have seen with Louisiana's English."
8347,17,louisiana,8347," Colonial French, although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English."
8348,17,louisiana,8348,"The renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the creation of Canadian-style French immersion schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic Francophone neighbourhoods of New Orleans and Lafayette."
8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the State has maintained the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which promotes the use of the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and the international relations of the State."

10743,23,mississippi,10743," Due to seasonal flooding from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries create a fertile flood plain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744,"The flood of the river created natural dikes, which the planters had built earlier to try to prevent flooding of cultivated land for the cultivation of cotton."
10745,23,mississippi,10745, Temporary workers built dikes along the Mississippi River above the natural dikes that formed from the land deposited after the flood of the river.
10746,23,mississippi,10746," From 1858 to 1861, the state took control of the construction of dykes, carrying it out through contractors and labour hires."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters felt that their slaves were too valuable to be hired for such a dangerous job."
10748,23,mississippi,10748, Entrepreneurs have hired Irish immigrant gangs to build dams and sometimes open land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749, Many Irish were relatively recent immigrants from years of famine who struggled to settle.
10750,23,mississippi,10750," Prior to the U.S. Civil War, the earth dams had an average height of six feet, although in some areas they reached 20 feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751," Floods have been an integral part of Mississippi's history, but the clearing of land for the cultivation and supply of wood to steamboats has removed the absorption of trees and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river have been denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753," After the civil war, major flooding destroyed the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754," Such floods regularly submerged the dikes damaged by the Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those built after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties."
10756,23,mississippi,10756,"In 1879, the United States Congress established the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included assisting state moat building."
10757,23,mississippi,10757,"At the end of the 19th century, temporary white or black workers were hired to build the dykes."
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"In 1882 the dikes averaged seven feet in height, but much in the southern delta was severely affected by flooding that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759," After the flood of 1882, the dam system was expanded."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the district of Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee was established to oversee the construction and maintenance of dykes in the northern counties of the delta; there were also some Arkansas counties that were part of the delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761," Floods submerged the northwest of Mississippi in 1912-13, causing heavy damage to the dikes districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,The regional losses and lobbying of the Mississippi River Levee Association for a flood control bill contributed to the passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide matching federal funds to local dyke districts on a 2:1 scale.
10763,23,mississippi,10763," Although U.S. participation in the First World War interrupted the financing of the dikes, the second round of funding brought the average height of the dikes in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764, Scientists now understand that dykes have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow rate of the river and reducing the area of floodplains.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The area was severely damaged due to the Mississippi flood in 1927, which crossed the dikes."
10766,23,mississippi,10766," There were losses of millions of dollars in goods, stocks and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The most serious damage occurred in the lower delta, including the counties of Washington and Bolivar."
10768,23,mississippi,10768," Although scientific knowledge of the Mississippi River has increased, upstream development and the consequences of dykes have caused more severe flooding in some years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769, Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and the construction of dikes have changed the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770," This work has eliminated the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, thus strengthening the flow of the river."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The federal and state governments have struggled for the best approaches to restoring certain natural habitats to better interact with the original river ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772," Nearly 10,000 Native Americans or Paleo-Indians from BC have arrived in what is now known as the South American."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,"In the South, Paleo-Indians are hunter-gatherers who pursue the megafauna that is extinct after the end of the Pleistocene age."
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Native American colonies and agricultural fields were developed on natural dikes, higher in the vicinity of rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Amerindians developed large fields near their permanent villages.
10776,23,mississippi,10776," Along with other practices, they created some localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777," After thousands of years, the following crops of the Wood Age and Mississippi have developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which the surplus has supported the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778, Both were mound builders' cultures.
10779,23,mississippi,10779,"The Mississippi culture was the largest and most complex, built from around 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,"The people had a commercial network that spanned the entire continent, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf coast."
10781,23,mississippi,10781," Their large terraces, expressing their cosmology of political and religious concepts, are still in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys."
10782,23,mississippi,10782,Amerindian tribes descending from Mississippi culture in the southeast include Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783," Other tribes that inhabited Mississippi (and whose names were honoured by settlers in local cities) include Natchez, Yazoo and Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who crossed the northeastern part of the state in 1540, during his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French settlers established the first European settlement in Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built near current ocean sources on the Gulf coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was installed by Pierre Le Moyne of Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,"In 1716, the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (under the name of Fort Rosalie) and became the dominant town and trading post of the region."
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the largest territory ""New France""; the Spaniards continued to claim part of the Gulf Coast region (east of Mobile Bay) of the present-day southern Alabama, in addition to the entire current Florida region."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"In the 18th century, the region was governed by colonial governments in Spain, France and the United Kingdom."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,Settlers import African slaves as labourers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791," Under French and Spanish domination, there has been the development of a class of free people of colour (people of free colour), mainly multiracial descendants of European men and black women enslaved or free, and their Métis children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,"At first, the French and Spanish settlers were mostly men."
10793,23,mississippi,10793," While more and more European women have joined the colonies, men have race unions between women of African descent (and increasingly of multiracial ancestry), before and after the marriage of European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"European men often help their multiracial children to educate themselves or acquire apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settle on them; they often free mothers and their children if they are slaves, under placarding contracts."
10795,23,mississippi,10795," With this social capital, people free of colour have become artisans, and sometimes educated traders and real estate owners, forming a third class between Europeans and Africans the most slaves in the French and Spanish colonies, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796," After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (seven-year war), the French ceded the Mississippi region to them under the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797," They also divest their areas to the north that are east of Mississippi, including Illinois and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798," After the Peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi fell under Spanish domination as part of western Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819, the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all East Florida in the Adams-Onís Treaty, and in 1822 the two were merged into Florida territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800," After the American revolution (1765–83), Britain gave up this region to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801,"The territory of Mississippi was organized on 7 April 1798, from the territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States."
10802,23,mississippi,10802, Their original colonial charters spread theoretically westward to the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803,The territory of Mississippi was extended twice later to include the disputed territory claimed by the United States and Spain.
10804,23,mississippi,10804," From about 1800 to 1830, the United States purchased land (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Amerindian tribes for new European American colonies."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mainly migrants from other southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were depleted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,New settlers continued to encroach on the lands of Choctaw and urged the federal government to expel the Amerindians.
10807,23,mississippi,10807,"On September 27, 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the United States government and the Choctaw."
10808,23,mississippi,10808,The Choctaws agreed to sell their traditional lands in Mississippi and Alabama for compensation and removal of reserves in Indian territory (now Oklahoma).
10809,23,mississippi,10809, This opened up land for sale at the European-American migrant establishment.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 of the Treaty allows Choctaws who choose to remain in the states to become American citizens, as they are considered to abandon their tribal affiliation."
10811,23,mississippi,10811," They were the second indigenous ethnic group in America to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas instead of joining the abduction)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812," Today, their descendants include approximately 9,500 people who identify themselves as Choctaw, and who live in Neshoba, Newton, Leake and Jones counties."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band was reorganized in the 20th century and is a tribe recognized by the federal government.
10814,23,mississippi,10814," Many slave owners brought African-American slaves with them or bought them through the slave trade, especially in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"As a result of this trade, nearly a million slaves were forcibly transported to the deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke many families of Upper South slaves, where planters sold surplus slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816, Southerners imposed slave laws in the deep south and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817," Beginning in 1822, Mississippi slaves were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishment by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,"In most cases, the codes of the southern slave have made it illegal for a slave to be killed voluntarily."
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, in the Mississippi case of 1860, Oliver v. State accused the accused of killing his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820," Mississippi became the 20th state on December 10, 1817."
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes was the first governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as an ancestral land by several American Aboriginal tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823," Plantations have been developed mainly along the main rivers, where the seafront has provided access to the main transport routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"It is also where the first cities develop, connected by steamboats that transport commercial products and crops to the markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The rest of the Amerindian ancestral lands remained largely undeveloped, but were sold by treaty until 1826 when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826," Following the abolition of the Choctaw Tribal Government by the Mississippi State Legislative Assembly in 1829, the Indian Abduction Act of President Andrew Jackson and the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty of 1830, the Choctaws were forced to sell their lands and transported to Oklahoma territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, along with other southeastern tribes abducted under the Act, has become known as the Tears Trail."
10828,23,mississippi,10828," When cotton was king in the 1850s, the owners of Mississippi plantations, especially those in the central Delta and black belt regions, became rich because of the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market and the free labour acquired thanks to their African-American enslavement outfit."
10829,23,mississippi,10829, They used some of their profits to buy more cotton and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830,The dependence of planters on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labour and the serious imbalances of wealth among whites have played a strong role both in State policy and in supporting planters for secession.
10831,23,mississippi,10831,The Mississippi is a slave society whose economy depends on slavery.
10832,23,mississippi,10832,"The state was very sparsely populated, with the population concentrated in riparian areas and cities."
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"In 1860, the enslaved Afro-American population numbered 436,631, representing 55 per cent of the total State population, or 791,305 persons."
10834,23,mississippi,10834, Less than 1000 were colour-free people.
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively small population of the State prior to the civil war reflects the fact that land and villages have only been developed along the banks of the river, which constitute the main transport corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836, Ninety per cent of the ground land in the Delta was still at the border and was not developed.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The state needs much more settlers to develop.
10838,23,mississippi,10838,Land farther from the rivers was cleared by liberated men and white migrants during reconstruction and later.
10839,23,mississippi,10839,"On January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union and it was one of the founding members of the Confederate States."
10840,23,mississippi,10840,The first six states to separate are those that have the largest number of slaves.
10841,23,mississippi,10841," During the war, the forces of the Union and the Confederation fought for domination over the Mississippi River, critical for supply routes and trade."

11224,24,missouri,11224," They are said to have been called the Ouemessourita (wimihsoorita), meaning ""those who have excavation canoes"", by the Miami-Illinois language speakers."
11225,24,missouri,11225," This seems to be folk etymology — Illinois spoke an Algonquian language and the closest approximation that can be made in that of their close neighbours, the Ojibwe, is ""You should go down and visit these people."""
11226,24,missouri,11226," This would be a strange event, because the French who first explored and tried to settle in Mississippi generally obtained their translations during this fairly precise period, often giving things French names that were accurate translations of the native language(s)."
11227,24,missouri,11227," Assuming that Missouri is derived from the Siwan language, it translates as ""it connects to its side"", with reference to the river itself."
11228,24,missouri,11228," This is not quite probable either, because it would come out under the name ""Maya Sunni"" (Mah-yah soo-nee)."
11229,24,missouri,11229," Most likely, however, the name Missouri comes from Chiwere, a Siwan language spoken by people living in the modern states of Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri and Nebraska."
11230,24,missouri,11230,"The name ""Missouri"" has several different pronunciations even among its natives of today, the two most common being (listen) miz-UR-ee and (listen) miz-UR-."
11231,24,missouri,11231," Other pronunciations also exist in Missouri or elsewhere in the United States, involving the realization of the medial consonant as either or ; the vowel in the second syllable as either or ; and the third syllable as (phonetically [i] (listening), [=] (listening) or [==] (listening) or."

11233,24,missouri,11233,"In English, the pronunciation has been received, the preferred variant is miz-OR-ee, the mis-OR-ee being a possible alternative."
11234,24,missouri,11234," Linguistic history was definitely dealt with by Donald M. Lance, who acknowledged that the issue was sociologically complex, but no pronunciation could be declared ""correct"", nor clearly defined as native or external, rural or urban, southern or northern, educated or otherwise."
11235,24,missouri,11235," Politicians often use multiple pronunciations, even in a single speech, to appeal to a greater number of listeners."

11238,24,missouri,11238," However, Missouri's unofficial nickname is ""Show Me State"", which appears on its license plates."
11239,24,missouri,11239, This sentence is of multiple origin.
11240,24,missouri,11240,"One is largely attributed to a speech by MP Willard Vandiver in 1899, who declared that ""I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cocks and democrats, and the sparkling eloquence does not convince me or satisfy me."
11241,24,missouri,11241,"I'm from Missouri, and you have to show me."""
11242,24,missouri,11242,"It's in agreement with the saying ""I'm from Missouri,"" which means ""I'm sceptical about the issue and I'm not easily convinced."""
11243,24,missouri,11243," However, according to the researchers, the expression ""show me"" was already used before the 1890s."
11244,24,missouri,11244," Another indicates that this is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado, to replace the workers on strike."
11245,24,missouri,11245," Because the new men were not familiar with mining methods, they needed frequent instruction."
11246,24,missouri,11246," Other nicknames for Missouri include ""The Lead State"", ""The State of Bullion"", ""The State of Ozark"", ""The Mother of the West"", ""The State of the Iron Mountain"", and ""Western Pennsylvania""."
11247,24,missouri,11247,"It is also known as the ""State of the Cellar"" because there are more than 7,300 caves registered in the State (second in Tennessee)."

11253,24,missouri,11253, Their large cities include thousands of individual residences.
11254,24,missouri,11254," Yet, they are known for their massive earth-moving mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platforms, peaks and conical forms."

11260,24,missouri,11260,"For most of the first half of the 1700s, the western shore of Mississippi that was to become the Missouri was largely uninhabited, a land of no man who kept peace between Illinois on the east shore of Mississippi and north, and the Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley."
11261,24,missouri,11261,"In the early 1700s, French merchants and missionaries explored the entire Mississippi Valley, known as the Louisiana region.At the same time, a different group of French Canadians who established five villages on the east shore of Mississippi placed their colonies in Illinois, Illinois."

11270,24,missouri,11270,"Sainte-Geneviève became a prosperous agricultural centre, producing enough surplus wheat, corn and tobacco to ship tonnes of grain annually to Lower Louisiana to trade there."
11271,24,missouri,11271, Grain production in Illinois was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.
11272,24,missouri,11272,Saint-Louis was founded shortly afterwards by Pierre Laclède and the son-in-law Auguste Chouteau de la Nouvelle-Orléans in 1764.
11273,24,missouri,11273," From 1764 to 1803, European control of the area west of Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri basin, known as Louisiana, was assumed by the Spaniards as part of the vice-royalty of New Spain, because of the Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order for Spain to join France in the war against England)."

11275,24,missouri,11275,"Saint-Louis became the centre of a regional fur trade with Amerindian tribes that expanded the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades."

11277,24,missouri,11277, They provided a variety of goods to dealers for sale and trade with their Amerindian customers.
11278,24,missouri,11278,The fur trade and associated companies have made St. Louis an early financial centre and provided wealth to some to build beautiful houses and import luxury goods.
11279,24,missouri,11279, Its location near the Illinois confluence meant that it also treated agricultural products.
11280,24,missouri,11280,River traffic and trade along the Mississippi River were an integral part of the state economy.
11281,24,missouri,11281,"As the first major city in the region, Saint-Louis expanded considerably following the invention of the steamboat and the increase in river trade."
11282,24,missouri,11282, Napoleon Bonaparte had acquired Louisiana for the French property of Spain in 1800 under the treaty of San Ildefonso after he had been a Spanish colony since 1762.
11283,24,missouri,11283,But the treaty was kept a secret.
11284,24,missouri,11284," Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the transfer to the United States."
11285,24,missouri,11285,"Part of the purchase of Louisiana by the United States in 1803, the Missouri won the nickname ""Porte de l'Ouest"" because it served as an important starting point for expeditions and settlers heading west in the 19th century."
11286,24,missouri,11286,"Saint-Charles, just west of Saint-Louis, was the starting point and return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which climbed on the Missouri River in 1804 to explore the lands from the west to the Pacific Ocean."

11289,24,missouri,11289," They settled mainly in 17 counties along the Missouri River, in an area of plains that allowed the farming of plantations and became known as ""Petit Dixie""."
11290,24,missouri,11290,The state was shaken by the earthquakes of 1811 to 1812.
11291,24,missouri,11291, Losses were small due to the sparse population.
11292,24,missouri,11292,"In 1821, the former Missouri territory was admitted as a slave state, under the compromise of Missouri, and with a temporary state capital in Saint Charles."
11293,24,missouri,11293,"In 1826 the capital was moved to its current permanent location in Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River."
11294,24,missouri,11294," Originally the western border of the state was a straight line, defined as the meridian passing through Kawsmouth, the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River."
11295,24,missouri,11295," Since that designation, the river has moved."
11296,24,missouri,11296, This line is known as the Osage Border.
11297,24,missouri,11297,"In 1836, the purchase of the Platte was added to the northwest corner of the state after the purchase of the lands of the native tribes, making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River."
11298,24,missouri,11298," This addition increased the area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to the 65,000 square miles of Virginia, which then included West Virginia)."
11299,24,missouri,11299,"In the early 1830s, Mormon migrants from the northern states and Canada began to settle near Independence and areas just north of the island."
11300,24,missouri,11300," Conflicts over religion and slavery have arisen between the ""former settlers"" (mainly from the south) and the Mormons (mainly from the north)."
11301,24,missouri,11301,The Mormon war broke out in 1838.
11302,24,missouri,11302,"In 1839, with the help of a ""order of extermination"" by Governor Lilburn Boggs, the former settlers forcibly expelled the Mormons of Missouri and confiscated their lands."
11303,24,missouri,11303, Conflicts over slavery exacerbated border tensions between states and territories.
11304,24,missouri,11304," From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with Iowa over what is known as Honey Lands led to the calling of militias from both states along the border."
11305,24,missouri,11305," With the increase in migration from the 1830s to the 1860s, the Missouri population almost doubled with every decade."
11306,24,missouri,11306," Most of the newcomers were born in the United States, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s."
11307,24,missouri,11307,"As the majority were Catholics, they created their own religious institutions in the state, most of which had been Protestants."
11308,24,missouri,11308," Many settled in cities, creating a regional network and then a state network of Catholic churches and schools."
11309,24,missouri,11309,19th-century German immigrants created the wine industry along Missouri and the beer industry in Saint-Louis.
11310,24,missouri,11310," While many German immigrants were strongly anti-slavery, many Irish immigrants living in the cities were pro-slavery, fearing that the liberation of African-American slaves would create a mass of unskilled labour, thereby lowering wages."
11311,24,missouri,11311, Most farmers in Missouri were engaged in subsistence farming prior to the American Civil War.
11312,24,missouri,11312,The majority of those who were slaves had fewer than five persons each.
11313,24,missouri,11313," Planters, defined by some historians as those who hold about 20 or more slaves, were concentrated in the counties known as ""Little Dixie"" in the central part of the state along the Missouri River."
11314,24,missouri,11314,Tensions about slavery relate mainly to the future of the State and the nation.
11315,24,missouri,11315,"In 1860, Afro-American enslaved persons accounted for less than 10% of the state's population, or 1,182,012."
11316,24,missouri,11316,"To control the flooding of agricultural land and low-lying villages along Mississippi, the state had completed the construction of 230 kilometres of dikes along the river in 1860."
11317,24,missouri,11317," After the secession of the southern states began in 1861, the parliament of Missouri called for the election of a special convention on secession."
11318,24,missouri,11318,Pro-South Governor Claiborne F. Jackson ordered the mobilization of several hundred members of the state militia who had assembled in a camp in Saint-Louis to train.
11319,24,missouri,11319," Alarmed by this act, the General Union Nathaniel Lyon strikes first, encircling the camp and forcing the troops of the State to surrender."
11320,24,missouri,11320,"Lyon led his soldiers, largely non-English-speaking German immigrants, to walk the prisoners through the streets, and they opened fire on the widely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them."
11321,24,missouri,11321," Soldiers killed unarmed prisoners as well as men, women and children of Saint-Louis in the incident known as the Massacre de Saint-Louis."
11322,24,missouri,11322, These events have increased the confederate support within the state.
11323,24,missouri,11323," Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price, president of the secession convention, to head the new Missouri State Guard."

11338,24,missouri,11338," Historians have portrayed stories of the outlaw years of the James brothers as an American myth ""Robin Hood""."
11339,24,missouri,11339,"The legal activities of the Bald Knobbers of the Ozarks in the 1880s were an informal continuation of the insurgent mentality long after the official end of the war, and they are a favorite theme in Branson's image."

11349,24,missouri,11349,"The growth of the Texas cattle industry as well as the increase in railway infrastructure and the invention of the cold car also made Kansas City an important meat packaging centre, while Texas's major cattle roads brought cattle herds to Dodge City and other Kansas cities."

11361,24,missouri,11361," However, in a separate investigation, the Ministry of Justice also concluded that the Ferguson Police Department and the city of Ferguson relied on unconstitutional practices to balance the city's budget with racially motivated fines and excessive sanctions, that the Ferguson police ""used excessive and dangerous force and disproportionately targeted blacks"", and that the municipal court ""emphasized revenues to the detriment of public security, resulting in systematic violations of constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law""."

11376,24,missouri,11376," Although it is now generally considered to be part of the Midwest, Missouri has always been regarded by many as a border state, mainly because of the establishment of migrants from the South and its status as a slave state before the civil war, in balance with the influence of Saint Louis."

11651,25,montana,11651, Montana is a state in the northwestern part of the United States of America.
11652,25,montana,11652,"It is bordered by Idaho to the west; North Dakota and South Dakota to the east; Wyoming to the south; and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan to the north."
11653,25,montana,11653,"It is the fourth largest state per region, the eighth least populated, and the third least dense."
11654,25,montana,11654,"The western half of Montana contains many mountain ranges, while half is characterized by prairie terrain and western badlands, with more (though smaller) mountain ranges throughout the state."
11655,25,montana,11655,A total of 77 designated ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains.
11656,25,montana,11656," Montana has no official nickname, but several unofficial ones, including ""Big Sky Country"", ""The Treasure State"", ""Land of the Shining Mountains"", and ""The Last Best Place""."
11657,25,montana,11657,"The economy is mainly based on agriculture, including livestock and cereal production."
11658,25,montana,11658," Other important economic resources include oil, gas, coal, mining and timber."
11659,25,montana,11659,"The health care, service and government sectors are also important to the government economy."
11660,25,montana,11660,"The fastest growing area in Montana is tourism, with nearly 13 million annual visitors visiting Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Beartooth Highway, Flathead Lake, Big Sky Resort and other attractions."
11661,25,montana,11661,"The name Montana comes from the Spanish word montaña, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, meaning ""mountain"" or more widely ""mountainous country""."
11662,25,montana,11662,Montaña del Norte is the name given by the first Spanish explorers to the whole western mountainous region.
11663,25,montana,11663,The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill of the United States House Committee on Territories (then chaired by James Ashley of Ohio) for the territory that would become Idaho's territory.
11664,25,montana,11664,"The name was changed by representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained Montana had ""no sense."""
11665,25,montana,11665," When Ashley introduced a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be dug out of Idaho, he again chose the territory of Montana."
11666,25,montana,11666," This time, Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, opposed the name."
11667,25,montana,11667,Cox complained that the name was a bad name since most of the territory was not mountainous and a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish name.
11668,25,montana,11668," Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but the Territorial Committee decided that they could appoint it as they wished, so that the original name of Montana was adopted."
11669,25,montana,11669, Montana is one of eight mountain states in the northern part of the region known as the Western United States.
11670,25,montana,11670,It is bordered by North Dakota and South Dakota in the east.
11671,25,montana,11671,"Wyoming is to the south, Idaho to the west and south-west, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan are to the north, making it the only state to border three Canadian provinces."
11672,25,montana,11672," With an area of 147,040 square miles (380,800 km2), Montana is slightly larger than Japan."
11673,25,montana,11673,"It is the fourth largest state in the United States after Alaska, Texas, and California; it is the largest landlocked state."
11674,25,montana,11674,"State topography is roughly defined by the continental division, which divides much of the state into distinct regions of the east and west."
11675,25,montana,11675," Most of the hundreds of mountain ranges in Montana lie in the western half of the state, most of which are geologically and geographically located in northern Rocky Mountains."
11676,25,montana,11676,The Absaroka and Beartooth chains in the southern central part of the state are technically part of the central Rocky Mountains.
11677,25,montana,11677,The Rocky Mountain Front is an important feature of the north-central part of the state and of isolated island chains that interrupt the common prairie landscape in the central and eastern parts of the state.
11678,25,montana,11678," Approximately 60 percent of the state is a prairie, which is part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains, one of the longest continuous chains in the Alaska Mountain Range in Mexico, as well as smaller chains, including the Alene Heart Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the state of Idaho."
11680,25,montana,11680,The southern third of Bitterroot's range lies in the continental ditch.
11681,25,montana,11681," Other major mountain ranges to the west of the fracture include the Cabinet Mountains, Anaconda Range, Missions, Garnet Range, Sapphire Mountains and Flint Creek Range."
11682,25,montana,11682,"The northern section of the ditch, where mountains quickly gave way to the prairies, was part of the Rocky Front."
11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is the most prominent in the Lewis Range, located mainly in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684," Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (starting on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska) crosses this area and turns east into Montana at Triple Divide Peak."
11685,25,montana,11685,"It causes the Waterton, Belly and Saint Mary rivers to flow north in Alberta, Canada."
11686,25,montana,11686," They joined the Saskatchewan River, which eventually drained into Hudson Bay."
11687,25,montana,11687,"To the east of the fracture, several roughly parallel ranges cover the southern part of the state, including the Gravelly Range, the Madison Range, the Gallatin Range, the Absaroka Mountains and the Beartooth Mountains."
11688,25,montana,11688,"The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass of more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) tall in the American continent."
11689,25,montana,11689,"It contains the highest point of the state, Granite Peak, 12,799 feet (3,901 m) tall."
11690,25,montana,11690,"To the north of these chains are the great mountains of the belt, the Bridger Mountains, tobacco roots and several island chains, including the Crazy Mountains and Little Belt."
11691,25,montana,11691, Between numerous mountain ranges there are rich river valleys.
11692,25,montana,11692,"The Big Hole Valley, the Bitterroot Valley, the Gallatin Valley, the Flathead Valley and the Paradise Valley have extensive agricultural resources and many opportunities for tourism and recreation."
11693,25,montana,11693,"To the east and north of this transition zone are the large, sparsely populated northern plains, with plains, small island mountain ranges and badlands."
11694,25,montana,11694,"The isolated islands east of Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains, the Bull Mountains, the Castle Mountains, the Crazy Mountains, the Highwood Mountains, the Judith Mountains, the Little Belt Mountains, the Little Rocky Mountains, the Pryor Mountains, the Little Snowy Mountains, the Big Snowy Mountains, the Sweet Grass Hills, and, in the southeast corner of the state near Ekalaka, the Long Pines."
11695,25,montana,11695, Many of these isolated areas were created about 120 to 66 million years ago when the magma ripped off from the inside and prostrated in front of the earth's surface here.
11696,25,montana,11696,The area east of the division in the north-central part of the state is known for the Missouri Breaks and other important rock formations.
11697,25,montana,11697," Three butts south of Great Falls are important landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw and Buttes."
11698,25,montana,11698," Known as laccoliths, they form when igneous rock passes through cracks in sedimentary rock."
11699,25,montana,11699,The underlying surface is sandstone and shale.
11700,25,montana,11700,"The area's surface soils are very diverse and heavily affected by local geology, whether they are glazed plains, inter-mountain basins, mountain foothills or plateaus."
11701,25,montana,11701,"The regions of the foothill are often covered with broken stones or slates, or consist of bare rocks discovered (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil of the intermountainous basins generally consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt and volcanic ash, much of which was made up of lakes that covered the area during the oligocene 33-23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"The trays are often surmounted by argillite gravel and quartzite weather, sometimes under the shale."
11704,25,montana,11704,"The glaciated plains are generally covered with clay, gravel, sand and silt left by Great Falls Proglacial Lake or by moraines or former gravel-covered lake basins left by Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago."
11705,25,montana,11705," Further east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka house some of the most picturesque areas of the state."
11706,25,montana,11706,The Hell Creek Formation in northeastern Montana is a major source of dinosaur fossils.
11707,25,montana,11707,The paleontologist Jack Horner of the Bozeman Rockies Museum brought this training to the attention of the world with several major discoveries.
11708,25,montana,11708," Montana has thousands of named rivers and streams, 720 km of which are known for the blue-ribbon trout fishery."
11709,25,montana,11709," Montana's water resources provide recreation, hydropower, irrigation of crops and fodder, mining and water for human consumption."
11710,25,montana,11710," Montana is one of the few geographic regions in the world where rivers form parts of three major watersheds (i.e., the Great Lakes)."
11711,25,montana,11711, where two continental divides intersect).
11712,25,montana,11712," Its rivers feed on the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay."
11713,25,montana,11713,The watersheds are divided into Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park.
11714,25,montana,11714," While Hudson Bay is considered part of the Arctic Ocean, Triple Divide Peak is the only place on Earth where there are three different oceans."
11715,25,montana,11715,"All of Montana's waters, west of the divided stream, flow into the Columbia River."
11716,25,montana,11716,"The Columbia Clark fork (not to be confused with the Clarks fork in the Yellowstone River) rises near Butte and flows northwest to Missoula, where it is joined by the Blackfoot River and the Bitterroot River."
11717,25,montana,11717," Further downstream, it is reached by the Flathead River before entering Idaho near Lake Pend Oreille."
11718,25,montana,11718,The Pend Oreille River forms the flow from Pend Oreille Lake.
11719,25,montana,11719,"The Pend Oreille River reaches the Columbia River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean, making the Clark Fork/Pend Oreille River, 932 km long, the longest of the Rocky Mountains."
11720,25,montana,11720,The Clark fork discharges the largest volume of water from any river leaving the state.
11721,25,montana,11721,"Kootenai River, northwest of Montana, is another major tributary of Colombia."
11722,25,montana,11722,"East of the Missouri River division, formed by the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin rivers near Three Forks, flows northward through the central western part of the state to Great Falls."
11723,25,montana,11723," From this point, it usually flows eastward through fairly flat farmland and the Missouri breaks down to the Fort Peck reservoir."
11724,25,montana,11724,"The portion of the river between Fort Benton and Fred Robinson Bridge, at the western boundary of the Fort Peck Reservoir, was designated Wild and Scenic River in 1976."
11725,25,montana,11725,Missouri enters North Dakota near Fort Union after draining more than half of the area of Montana (82 000 square miles (210 000 km2)).
11726,25,montana,11726," Nearly a third of the Missouri River, Montana, is behind 10 dams: Toston, Canyon Ferry, Hauser, Holter, Black Eagle, Rainbow, Cochrane, Ryan, Morony and Fort Peck."
11727,25,montana,11727," Other important tributaries of Missouri Montana include the Smith, Milk, Marias, Judith and Musselshell rivers."
11728,25,montana,11728," Montana also claims the disputed title of possession of the world's shortest river, the Roe River, just outside Great Falls."
11729,25,montana,11729,"By Missouri, these rivers finally reach the Mississippi River and flow into the Gulf of Mexico."
11730,25,montana,11730,"Hell Roaring Creek begins in southern Montana and when combined with Red Rock, Beaverhead, Jefferson, Missouri and Mississippi, it is the longest river in North America and the fourth longest river in the world."
11731,25,montana,11731,The Yellowstone River rises on the continental ditch near the top of the yuntas in the Wyoming Teton nature.
11732,25,montana,11732,"It crosses Yellowstone National Park in the north, entering Montana near Gardiner and crossing the Paradise Valley to Livingston."
11733,25,montana,11733,"It then flows northeast across the state through Billings, Miles City, Glendive and Sidney."
11734,25,montana,11734,The Yellowstone joined Missouri in North Dakota east of Fort Union.
11735,25,montana,11735,"It is the longest undamaged open river in the United States and drains about a quarter of Montana (36,000 square miles (93,000 km2))."
11736,25,montana,11736,"The major tributaries of Yellowstone are the Boulder, Stillwater, Clarks Fork, Bighorn, Tongue and Powder rivers."
11737,25,montana,11737,"The Northern Divide turns east at Montana at Triple Divide Peak, so the Waterton, Belly and Saint Mary rivers flow north to Alberta."

11766,25,montana,11766," Montana is a great state with considerable variations in geography, topography and altitude, and the climate is therefore equally varied."
11767,25,montana,11767,"The state extends from the bottom of the 45th parallel (the equidistant line between the equator and the North Pole) to the 49th parallel, and altitudes range from less than 2,000 feet (610 m) to nearly 13,000 feet (4,000 m) above sea level."
11768,25,montana,11768,"The west half is mountainous, interrupted by several large valleys."
11769,25,montana,11769," Eastern Montana includes plains and badlands, fragmented by isolated hills and mountain ranges, and has a semi-arid and continental climate (Köppen BSk climate classification)."
11770,25,montana,11770,"The continental ditch has a considerable effect on the climate, as it limits the warmer air flow in the Pacific from the east and the drier continental air from the west."
11771,25,montana,11771,"The area to the west of the ditch has a modified climate on the Pacific North Coast, with milder winters, cooler summers, less wind and a longer growing season."
11772,25,montana,11772," Low clouds and fog often form in valleys west of division in winter, but this is rarely seen to the east."
11773,25,montana,11773, Average daytime temperatures range from 28°F or -2.2°C in January to 84.5°F or 29.2°C in July.
11774,25,montana,11774,Variation in geography results in a large variation in temperature.
11775,25,montana,11775,The highest summer temperature observed was 117°F or 47.2°C at Glendive on 20 July 1893 and at Medicine Lake on 5 July 1937.

11781,25,montana,11781," Temperatures vary considerably during cold nights, and Helena, at 64 km to the southeast, experienced only a low of -36°F or -37.8°C on the same date, and a record historical record of -42°F or -41.1°C."
11782,25,montana,11782, Cold winter spells are usually the result of cold continental air coming from southern Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The front is often well defined, resulting in a significant drop in temperature in 24 hours."
11784,25,montana,11784," Conversely, the south-west airflow translates into ""chinooks""."
11785,25,montana,11785," These steady winds from 25 to 50 mph (40 to 80 km/h) (or more) can suddenly warm up parts of Montana, especially areas just east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise to 50 to 60 degrees F (10 to 15.6 degrees Celsius) for 10 days or more."
11786,25,montana,11786,Loma is the site of the most extreme temperature change recorded in a 24-hour period in the US.
11787,25,montana,11787,"On 15 January 1972, a chinook wind blows and the temperature increases from -54°F to 49°F (−47.8°C to 9.4°C)."
11788,25,montana,11788,"The average annual precipitation is 15 inches (380 mm), but large variations are observed."
11789,25,montana,11789,"The mountain ranges block the damp air of the Pacific, maintaining moisture in the western valleys and creating rain shadows in the east."
11790,25,montana,11790,"Heron, in the West, receives the most precipitation, 34.70 inches (881 mm)."
11791,25,montana,11791,"On the east side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine makes an average of 11.45 inches (291 mm) and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation."
11792,25,montana,11792," Mountains can receive more than 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park receives 105 inches (2,700 mm)."
11793,25,montana,11793,An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a 16-year period.
11794,25,montana,11794, Most major cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year.
11795,25,montana,11795,Mountain chains can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow during the winter.
11796,25,montana,11796," Strong snowstorms can occur from September to May, although most snowfall occurs from November to March."
11797,25,montana,11797,The climate has become hotter in Montana and continues to do so.
11798,25,montana,11798,Glacier National Park glaciers have retreated and are expected to collapse completely in a few decades.
11799,25,montana,11799," Several cities in Montana recorded heat records in July 2007, the hottest month ever recorded in Montana."
11800,25,montana,11800,Winters are also warmer and have less cold spells.
11801,25,montana,11801," Previously, these cold spells had killed the beetles, but they are now attacking forests in western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the area have allowed various species to expand their range and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, beetle attack and poor management resulted in a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804," According to a study conducted by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some parts of Montana will experience a 200 per cent increase in the area burned by forest fires and an 80 per cent increase in related air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below lists average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month for the seven largest cities in Montana.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on the location, although the figures are similar overall."
11807,25,montana,11807, Montana is one of only two contiguous states (with Colorado) that are antipodal on land.
11808,25,montana,11808,The Kerguelen Islands are antipodal to the Montana/Saskatchewan/Alberta border.
11809,25,montana,11809,"No city is exactly antipodes to Kerguelen, although Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples have lived in the territory of the present state of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811," Historical tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers in the United States included the Crow in south-central, Cheyenne in the very southeast, Blackfeet, Assiniboine and Gros Ventres in central and north-central, and Kootenai and Salish in the west."
11812,25,montana,11812,"The smallest Pend of Oreille and Kalispel tribes lived near Flathead Lake and the western mountains, respectively."
11813,25,montana,11813,A portion of southeastern Montana was used as a corridor between the Crows and associated Hidatas in North Dakota.
11814,25,montana,11814,"The lands of Montana, to the east of the continental division, were part of the purchase of Louisiana in 1803."
11815,25,montana,11815," After and especially in the decades after the Lewis and Clark expeditions, American, British and French traders operated a fur trade, usually working with Aboriginal peoples, both in the eastern and western parts of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816," These transactions have not always been peaceful, and although the fur trade has brought material gain to Aboriginal tribal groups, it has also exposed European diseases and altered their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The Fort Raymond trading post (1807–11) was built in Crow's Indian country in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818," Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), the lands west of the continental division were contested between the British and the United States and were known as Oregon countries."
11819,25,montana,11819,"The first permanent establishment by the Euro-Americans in what is now Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near Stevensville, today."
11820,25,montana,11820,In 1847 Fort Benton became the highest fur trade post in the Missouri River.
11821,25,montana,11821,"In the 1850s, settlers began to settle in the Beaverhead and Big Hole valleys from the Oregon Trail and the Clark fork valley."
11822,25,montana,11822,"The first gold discovered in Montana was in Gold Creek, near the present garrison in 1852."
11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of important mining discoveries in the western third of the state from 1862 onward found gold, silver, copper, lead and coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area."
11824,25,montana,11824,"The richest of all gold placer digs was found in Alder Gulch, where the city of Virginia City was established."
11825,25,montana,11825," Other rich placer deposits have been found in Last Chance Gulch, where the city of Helen, Confederate Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City is now located."
11826,25,montana,11826,Gold production from 1862 to 1876 was $144 million
11827,25,montana,11827,"The largest mining operations were in the town of Butte, which had huge deposits of silver and copper."
11828,25,montana,11828," Prior to the creation of Montana (1864–89), the present-day Montana areas were part of Oregon (1848–59), Washington (1853–63), Idaho (1863–64), and Dakota (1861–64)."
11829,25,montana,11829," Montana became an American territory (Montana Territory) on May 26, 1864."
11830,25,montana,11830,The first territorial capital is Bannack.
11831,25,montana,11831,The first territorial governor was Sidney Edgarton.
11832,25,montana,11832,The capital moved to Virginia City in 1865 and to Helena in 1875.
11833,25,montana,11833,"In 1870, the non-Indian population in Montana was 20,595."
11834,25,montana,11834,"The Montana Historical Society, founded February 2, 1865 in Virginia City, is the oldest such institution west of Mississippi (except Louisiana)."
11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870, respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and Washburn–Langford–Doane expeditions were launched from Helen into the Upper Yellowstone area and led directly to the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As settlers began to populate Montana between the 1850s and the 1870s, disputes ensued with the Amerindians, mainly over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, the territorial governor of Washington, Isaac Stevens, negotiated the Hellgate treaty between the U.S. government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille and the Kootenai people of western Montana, which established boundaries for tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838,The Treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839," While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reserve, the difficulty with the interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led Whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was open to colonization, but tribal nations challenged these provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first U.S. army post in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect the traffic of steamboats travelling to Fort Benton."
11842,25,montana,11842,More than a dozen additional military posts have been established in the State.
11843,25,montana,11843, Pressure on land ownership and control has increased due to gold discoveries in various parts of Montana and surrounding states.
11844,25,montana,11844,"Major battles took place in Montana during the Red Cloud War, the Great Sioux War of 1876 and the Nez Perce War and in conflicts with Piegan Blackfeet."
11845,25,montana,11845,"The most notable are the Marias Massacre (1870), the Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), the Battle of the Great Hole (1877) and the Battle of Bear Paw (1877)."
11846,25,montana,11846,The last conflict in Montana between the U.S. Army and the Amerindians occurred in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in the country of Big Horn.
11847,25,montana,11847,Survivors of Indians who have signed treaties are generally required to make reserves.
11848,25,montana,11848," Along with these conflicts, bison, a key arch species and the main source of proteins on which Aboriginal people had survived for centuries, were destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849," According to some estimates, more than 13 million bison were found in Montana in 1870."
11850,25,montana,11850,"In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded for a joint Congressional session to authorize the slaughter of herds in order to deprive the Indians of their food source."
11851,25,montana,11851,"In 1884, commercial hunting had led the bison to the brink of extinction; only 325 bison remained in the United States."
11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle farming has been at the heart of Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and exchanged fattened cattle in fertile valleys of Montana with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.
11853,25,montana,11853,Nelson Story introduced Texas Longhorn's first cattle into the territory in 1866.
11854,25,montana,11854,"Granville Stuart, Samuel Hauser and Andrew J. Davis began a large open-area cattle operation in Fergus County in 1879."
11855,25,montana,11855,The Ranch Grant-Kohrs National Historic Site at Deer Lodge is now maintained as a link to the late 19th-century ranch style.
11856,25,montana,11856,"Operated by the National Parks Service, this is a 1,900-acre ranch (7.7 km2)."
11857,25,montana,11857,The Northern Pacific Railroad (NPR) tracks reached Montana from the west in 1881 and from the east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858," However, in the 1870s, the railway played a leading role in tensions with the Amerindian tribes."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, president of the NPR, launched important surveys in the Yellowstone Valley in 1871, 1872 and 1873, which the Sioux strongly contested under the leadership of Chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860," These clashes, in part, contributed to the panic of 1873, a financial crisis which delayed the construction of the railway in Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"Surveys carried out in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped trigger the Great Sioux War in 1876."
11862,25,montana,11862,"The Transcontinental RPN was completed on September 8, 1883, at Gold Creek."
11863,25,montana,11863,"The Grand Chemin de fer du Nord (GNR) tracks reached the east of Montana in 1887 and when they reached the north of the Rocky Mountains in 1890, the GNR became a major tourism promoter in the Glacier National Park area."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893, in Scenic, Washington State."
11865,25,montana,11865,"In 1881, the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch line of the Pacific Union, completed a narrow line from northern Utah to Butte."
11866,25,montana,11866,"A number of small spur lines operated in Montana from 1881 to the 20th century, including the Oregon Short Line, the Montana Railway and the Milwaukee Road."
11867,25,montana,11867," Under the authority of territorial governor Thomas Meagher, the Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 as part of an unsuccessful attempt to become a state."
11868,25,montana,11868,"A second constitutional convention, held in Helena in 1884, produced a Constitution ratified 3:1 by the citizens of Montana in November 1884."
11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress only approved state status in Montana in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting state status in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington after the appropriate state constitutions had been drafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,In July 1889 the Montanas convened their third constitutional assembly and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government.
11871,25,montana,11871,"On November 8, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana the 41st State of the Union."
11872,25,montana,11872,The first governor of the State was Joseph K. Toole.
11873,25,montana,11873,In the 1880s Helena (the state capital) had more millionaires per capita than any other city in the United States.
11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land to settlers who could claim and ""proven"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875, Montana did not see a large influx of immigrants under the Act because 160 acres were usually insufficient to support a family in the arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,"In 1868 David Carpenter, near Helen, made the first claim under the act of ownership in Montana."
11877,25,montana,11877,"The first claim made by a woman was near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana pioneer, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"In 1880, the farms were in the greener valleys of central and western Montana, but few were on the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Lands Act of 1877 was passed to permit the settlement of arid lands in the west and awarded 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a $25 per acre price and a promise of irrigation of the land.
11880,25,montana,11880," After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would be owned by the colon."
11881,25,montana,11881," This law brought most of the cattle and sheep farmers to Montana, many of whom took their herds to the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land, and then abandoned it without paying the final fee."
11882,25,montana,11882," Some farmers arrived with the arrival of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railways during the 1880s and 1890s, albeit in relatively small numbers."
11883,25,montana,11883,"In the early 1900s James J. Hill, from the far north, began to promote settlement on the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods."
11884,25,montana,11884, This was followed by other railways.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the law on rehabilitation was passed, allowing the construction of irrigation projects in the river valleys of Montana."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909, Congress passed the Extended Houses Act, which extended the area of free land from 160 acres to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family, and in 1912 reduced the time to ""proven"" a claim to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Homesteads Act allowed 640 acres of homesteads in areas unfit for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888," This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of landowners, attracted by free land, with the First World War bringing particularly high wheat prices."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana was experiencing a temporary period of above-average rainfall."
11890,25,montana,11890,"The owners arriving at that time were known as ""Honyockers"" or ""scissors""."
11891,25,montana,11891," Although the word ""honyocker"", perhaps derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisory way to the owners as ""green horns"", ""new to their business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had agricultural experience, although many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892," However, farmers have had to deal with a number of problems."
11893,25,montana,11893, That was a massive debt.
11894,25,montana,11894,"In addition, most settlers came from moister areas, unprepared for dry climate, lack of trees and scarcity of water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small homes less than 320 acres (130 ha) were not suitable for the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896, Weather and agricultural conditions are much harsher and drier to the west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897, Then the droughts of 1917-1921 proved devastating.
11898,25,montana,11898," Many people left, and half of the state banks went bankrupt as a result of the provision of mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, the size of the holdings has increased and the number of holdings has decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"In 1910, the owners filed claims on more than five million acres, and in 1923, more than 93 million acres were cultivated."
11901,25,montana,11901,"In 1910, the Great Falls Land Office alone had more than a thousand property deposits per month, and at the top of 1917-1918, it had 14,000 each year."
11902,25,montana,11902,Major falls occurred as a result of the 1919 drought.
11903,25,montana,11903,"At the beginning of the First World War, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States declaration of war."
11904,25,montana,11904," His actions have been widely criticized in Montana, where support for war and patriotism have been strong."
11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917–18, due to a miscalculation of the population of Montana, approximately 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the state population, volunteered or were recruited into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906, This represented a contribution of the labour force to war that was 25 per cent higher than that of any other state on a per capita basis.
11907,25,montana,11907," About 1500 Montanians died as a result of the war and 2437 were wounded, as well as more than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908," Montana Remount station in Miles City provided 10,000 horse cavalry horses for the war, more than any other Army post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for Montana's mining, forestry and agricultural interests, as the demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the American Congress adopted the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the 1918 Sedition Act."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Parliament of Montana passed the Montana Sedition Act, which is a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912,"In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, the military, or symbols by speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana Act led to the arrest of more than 200 persons and the conviction of 78 persons, mainly of German or Austrian origin."
11914,25,montana,11914,Over 40 people spent time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, Governor Brian Schweitzer granted full posthumous pardons to all those found guilty of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed the entry of the United States into the war included groups of immigrants of the German and Irish heritage, as well as pacifist anabaptists such as the Hutterites and Mennonites, many of whom were also Germanic."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-war groups such as the Montana Defence Council, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and local ""loyalty committees"" were formed."
11918,25,montana,11918,The feeling of war was complicated by labour problems.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The Anaconda Copper Company, which was at its historic peak in copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and trade unions that struggle to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multi-ethnic community of important European immigrants, trade unions, in particular the new Metal Mining Workers' Union, opposed the war on the grounds that they mostly benefited from major interests in the softwood lumber and mining sector."
11921,25,montana,11921," Following the explosion of mining production and the speculator mine disaster in June 1917, Frank Little, a global organizer of industrial workers, arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave a few speeches with an incendiary anti-war rhetoric.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On 1 August 1917, he was dragged from his boarding school by masked vigilantes, and hanged on a railway lattice, considered to be a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,The murder of Little and the ensuing strikes led to the dispatch of the National Guard to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925," Overall, anti-German and anti-labor sentiment increased and created a movement that led to the adoption of the Montana Sedition Law the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Defence Council had become a State body empowered to prosecute and punish persons deemed to be in violation of the law."
11927,25,montana,11927,The council has also adopted rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting German speaking in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"In the wake of the legislative action of 1918, emotions increased."
11929,25,montana,11929,U.S. prosecutor Burton K. Wheeler and several District Court judges who were reluctant to prosecute or convict accused persons were strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930," Wheeler was brought before the Defence Council, although he avoided formal proceedings, and a judge of the Forsyth District Court was charged."
11931,25,montana,11931,Burns of German-language books and several quasi-hangings occurred.
11932,25,montana,11932,The ban on German speaking remains in force in the early 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Complementing wartime struggles, the 1918 influenza epidemic claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanians."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that took place led some historians to dub this period ""the agony of Montana""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after the First World War and lasted during the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936," This has caused enormous difficulties for farmers, herders and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937," Wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state an important producer; wheat has a relatively high protein content, which requires high prices."
11938,25,montana,11938," When the United States entered World War II on December 8, 1941, many Montanas enlisted in the army to escape the bad national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Over 40,000 Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year after the declaration of war and more than 57,000 joined before the end of the war."
11940,25,montana,11940," These figures represented about 10 per cent of the population of the state, and Montana again provided one of the highest per capita numbers of soldiers in any state."
11941,25,montana,11941," Many Native Americans were among those who served, including Crow Nation soldiers who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,"At least 1,500 Montanians died during the war."
11943,25,montana,11943," Montana was also the training ground of the First Special Service Force or ""Devil's Brigade"", an American commando-style joint force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for the mountain and winter conditions prior to its deployment."
11944,25,montana,11944,"Air bases were built in Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank and Glasgow, some of which were used as staging areas to prepare aircraft to be sent to Allied forces in the Soviet Union."
11945,25,montana,11945," During the war, some 30 Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs landed in Montana, although no victims or major forest fires were attributed to them."
11946,25,montana,11946,In 1940 Jeannette Rankin was again elected to Congress.
11947,25,montana,11947,"In 1941, as she did in 1917, she voted against the United States declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
11948,25,montana,11948," His was the only vote against the war, and following a public outcry over his vote, Rankin asked for police protection for a while."
11949,25,montana,11949," Other pacifists tended to be those of the ""Churches of Peace"" who generally opposed war."
11950,25,montana,11950, Many people claiming conscientious objector status from all over the United States were sent to Montana during the war as twins of smoke and for other tasks of fighting forest fires.
11951,25,montana,11951,"In 1942, the U.S. Army established the Rimini camp near Helen to train sled dogs in winter weather."
11952,25,montana,11952," During the Second World War, the planned USMontana warship was appointed in honour of the State, but it was never completed."
11953,25,montana,11953, Montana is the only one of the first 48 states that do not have a full warship to be named.
11954,25,montana,11954, Alaska and Hawaii both have nuclear submarines named after them.
11955,25,montana,11955, Montana is the only state of union without a modern naval ship named in its honour.
11956,25,montana,11956," However, in August 2007, Senator Jon Tester asked for a submarine to be named US Montana."
11957,25,montana,11957," Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced on September 3, 2015 that the Virginia-class SSN-794 submarine would become the second warship to bear this name."
11958,25,montana,11958," After World War II, Montana became host to the US Air Force Military Air Transport Service (1947) for air transport training in the C-54 Skymasters and, finally, in 1953, the Air Force and the Strategic Air Command's anti-missile forces were based at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls."

12593,27,nevada,12593,"In the framework of the Mexican Cessation (1848) and the California Gold Rush which then used Emigrant Trails across the region, the State region first evolved as part of the territory of Utah, then of the territory of Nevada (2 March 1861; named for Sierra Nevada)."
12594,27,nevada,12594," See History of Utah, History of Las Vegas, and the discovery of the first major American silver ore deposit at Comstock Lode under Virginia City, Nevada, in 1859."
12595,27,nevada,12595,"On 2 March 1861 the territory of Nevada separated from the territory of Utah and adopted its present name, abbreviated from the Sierra Nevada (Spanish for ""snowy mountain ranges"")."
12596,27,nevada,12596,The southern boundary of 1861 is commemorated by the historic markers of Nevada 57 and 58 in the counties of Lincoln and Nye.
12597,27,nevada,12597," Eight days before the presidential election of 1864, Nevada became the 36th state of the Union, despite the absence of the minimum required of 60,000 inhabitants to become a state."
12598,27,nevada,12598,"(At the time, the Nevada population was just over 10,000.)"
12599,27,nevada,12599," Rather than sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27 – the most expensive telegraph on file at the time for a single shipment."
12600,27,nevada,12600," Finally, Washington's answer came on October 31, 1864: ""the pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day has been admitted into the Union""."
12601,27,nevada,12601,"The state was rushed on 31 October to help secure the re-election of Abraham Lincoln on 8 November and Republican domination after the civil war in Congress, as the Nevada mining economy linked him to the more industrialized Union."
12602,27,nevada,12602,"As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the election hand in hand and did not need Nevada's help."
12603,27,nevada,12603, Nevada is one of only two states to extend its borders considerably after its admission to the Union.
12604,27,nevada,12604,"(The other was the Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the purchase of the Platte.)"
12605,27,nevada,12605,"In 1866, another part of the territory of western Utah was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state, setting the current eastern border."
12606,27,nevada,12606," Nevada reached its present southern boundary on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the part of Pah-Ute County in Arizona territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of the present Nevada south of the 37th parallel."
12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was caused by the discovery of gold in the region, and officials thought that Nevada would be better able to monitor the projected demographic boom."
12608,27,nevada,12608, This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area.
12609,27,nevada,12609, Mining has shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see Silver Mining in Nevada).
12610,27,nevada,12610," When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It, mining led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth."
12611,27,nevada,12611, Both mining and population declined temporarily in the late 19th century.
12612,27,nevada,12612," However, the rich silver strike in Tonopah in 1900, followed by strikes in Goldfield and Rhyolite, created a second mining boom in Nevada and the Nevada population."
12613,27,nevada,12613,"Unregulated gambling was common in the first mining towns in Nevada, but was banned in 1909 as part of a national anti-gambling crusade."
12614,27,nevada,12614," Due to subsequent declines in mining production and the decline in the agricultural sector during the Great Depression, Nevada again legalized the game on March 19, 1931, with the approval of the legislature."
12615,27,nevada,12615,The signature of Governor Fred B. Balzar promulgated the most liberal laws on divorce in the country and open gambling.
12616,27,nevada,12616,The reforms took place only eight days after the federal government introduced the $49 million construction contract for the Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam).
12617,27,nevada,12617,"The Nevada Test Site, 105 km northwest of the city of Las Vegas, was founded on 11 January 1951 for nuclear weapons testing."
12618,27,nevada,12618,"The site consists of approximately 1,350 square miles (3,500 square kilometres) of the desert and mountainous terrain."
12619,27,nevada,12619," Nuclear tests at the Nevada test site began with a 1 kiloton TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951."
12620,27,nevada,12620,"The last atmospheric test took place on July 17, 1962, and underground weapons tests continued until September 23, 1992."
12621,27,nevada,12621,The location is known to have the largest concentration of nuclear weapons detonated in the United States
12622,27,nevada,12622,More than 80 per cent of the state area belongs to the federal government.
12623,27,nevada,12623,The main reason for this is that homesteads have not been allowed in a size sufficient to be viable under the arid conditions prevailing throughout the Nevada desert.
12624,27,nevada,12624," Instead, the first settlers would house land surrounding a water source and then graze livestock on adjacent public lands, which is unnecessary for agriculture without access to water (this model of livestock farming still prevails)."
12625,27,nevada,12625,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Nevada's population was 3,080,156 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 45,764 residents (1.51%) since the 2018 U.S. Census estimate and an increase of 379,605 residents (14.06 per cent) since the 2010 U.S. Census."
12626,27,nevada,12626, Nevada recorded the highest population growth between 2017 and 2018.
12627,27,nevada,12627,"As of the 2010 census, 6.9 per cent of the State population was under the age of 5, 24.6 per cent under the age of 18 and 12 per cent over the age of 65."
12628,27,nevada,12628,Women made up approximately 49.5 per cent of the population.
12629,27,nevada,12629," Since the 2010 census, Nevada has experienced a natural increase of 87,581 people (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 people (104,032 of whom are due to internal migration and 42,594 due to international migration)."
12630,27,nevada,12630,The center of Nevada's population is in southern Nye County.
12631,27,nevada,12631,"In this county, the unincorporated city of Pahrump, 97 km west of Las Vegas on the California state line, grew very rapidly from 1980 to 2010."
12632,27,nevada,12632,"As of the 2010 census, the city had 36,441 residents."
12633,27,nevada,12633," Las Vegas grew from a mulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1970 and was the most dynamic city and metropolitan area in America from 1960 to 2000."
12634,27,nevada,12634," Between the 1940s and 2003, Nevada is the fastest growing state in the United States."
12635,27,nevada,12635," Between 1990 and 2000, Nevada's population increased by 66 per cent, while the country's population increased by 13 per cent."
12636,27,nevada,12636,"More than two-thirds of the population live in Clark County, which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12637,27,nevada,12637," Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation."
12638,27,nevada,12638,"Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the top 20 fastest growing cities in the United States with over 100,000 inhabitants."
12639,27,nevada,12639,"The rural community of Mesquite, 105 km northeast of Las Vegas, was an example of micropolitan growth in the 1990s and 2000."
12640,27,nevada,12640, Other desert cities like Indian Springs and Searchlight on the outskirts of Las Vegas have also seen some growth.
12641,27,nevada,12641," Since 1950, the Nevada-born population has never exceeded 27 per cent, the lowest rate in all states."

12643,27,nevada,12643," Most of the new residents of Nevada have moved from California, which has led some Nevadas to feel that their condition is ""californicized""."
12644,27,nevada,12644," According to the 2017 U.S. Community Survey, 28.2% of Nevada's population were of Hispanic or Latin origin (of any race): Mexican (21.4%), Puerto Rican (0.9%), Cuban (1.0%) and other Hispanic or Latin origin (4.8%)."
12645,27,nevada,12645,"The five largest non-Hispanic white ancestry groups were German (11.3%), Irish (9.0%), English (6.9%), Italian (5.8%) and American (4.7%)."

12647,27,nevada,12647,"In 2011, 63.6 per cent of the population of Nevada under 1 years of age were minorities."
12648,27,nevada,12648, Las Vegas is a minority town.
12649,27,nevada,12649," According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, as of 1 July 2018, non-Hispanic whites made up 48.7% of the Nevada population."

12655,27,nevada,12655,"At the end of the 20th century, many immigrants from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India and Vietnam arrived in the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12656,27,nevada,12656,"The city now has one of the most prolific American Asian communities in America, with a predominantly Chinese and Taiwanese region known as ""Chinatown"" west of the I-15 on Spring Mountain Road."
12657,27,nevada,12657,"The American Filipinos are the largest Asian group in the state, with a population of over 113,000."
12658,27,nevada,12658, They make up 56.5 per cent of the Asian population of Nevada and about 4.3 per cent of the population of the State as a whole.
12659,27,nevada,12659,The mining booms attract many Greek and Eastern European immigrants to Nevada.

12662,27,nevada,12662,"Note: The births in the table do not add up, as Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."
12663,27,nevada,12663,A small percentage of Nevada's population lives in rural areas.
12664,27,nevada,12664,The culture of these places differs significantly from the larger metropolitan areas.
12665,27,nevada,12665,"The inhabitants of these rural counties tend to be inhabitants of Nevada, unlike the Las Vegas and Reno regions, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state."
12666,27,nevada,12666,The rural population is also less diversified in terms of race and ethnicity.
12667,27,nevada,12667," Mining plays an important role in the economy of rural counties, with tourism being less important."
12668,27,nevada,12668,Ranching also has a long tradition in the rural Nevada.
12669,27,nevada,12669,Church attendance in Nevada is among the weakest in all U.S. states.
12670,27,nevada,12670,"In a 2009 Gallup poll, only 30% of Nevadas reported that they attended the church every week or almost, compared with 42% of all Americans (it was found that only four states had a lower attendance rate than Nevada)."

12681,27,nevada,12681, Nevada's economy has long been linked to vice-industries.
12682,27,nevada,12682,"""Nevada was founded on mining and refounded on sin – starting with the fight against prices and easy divorce a century ago, then extending to gambling and prostitution,"" said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist."
12683,27,nevada,12683,"In some parts of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas, mining plays a major economic role."
12684,27,nevada,12684,"In value terms, gold is by far the most important mineral exploited."
12685,27,nevada,12685,"In 2004, 6,800,000 ounces (1900,000,000 g) of gold worth $2.84 billion were exploited in Nevada and the State accounted for 8.7% of world gold production (see Gold Mining in Nevada)."
12686,27,nevada,12686,"Silver is a second distant, with 10,300,000 ounces (290,000 g) worth $69 million extracted in 2004 (see Silver mining in Nevada)."

12688,27,nevada,12688," Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high and production is very sensitive to world commodity prices."
12689,27,nevada,12689,Cattle rearing is a major economic activity in rural Nevada.
12690,27,nevada,12690," Nevada's agricultural products include cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions and potatoes."
12691,27,nevada,12691,"As at 1 January 2006, there were an estimated 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada."
12692,27,nevada,12692," Most of these animals feed in summer on routes, with extra food in winter."
12693,27,nevada,12693,Calfs are usually shipped to out-of-state feedlots in the fall to be fattened for the market.
12694,27,nevada,12694,"More than 90% of the 484,000 acres (196,000 ha) of Nevada's cropland are used to grow hay, mainly alfalfa, for livestock feed."
12695,27,nevada,12695,"The main employers of the State, in the first quarter of 2011, are the following, according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation:"
12696,27,nevada,12696,"Amtrak's California Zephyr train uses the original Union Pacific transcontinental railway line in daily service from Chicago to Emeryville, California, serving Elko, Winnemucca and Reno."
12697,27,nevada,12697, Las Vegas has not had a passenger train service since the cessation of Amtrak Desert Wind in 1997.
12698,27,nevada,12698,"Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provides a connecting service from Las Vegas for trains in Needles, California, Los Angeles and Bakersfield, California; and from Stateline, Nevada, to Sacramento, California."
12699,27,nevada,12699, There have been a number of proposals to reintroduce the service in Los Angeles or southern California.
12700,27,nevada,12700,The Union Pacific Railroad has a few railways to the north and south of Nevada.
12701,27,nevada,12701,Greyhound Lines offers a bus service to the state.
12702,27,nevada,12702,"Interstate 15 (I-15) passes through the south end of the state, serving Las Vegas and other communities."
12703,27,nevada,12703,I-215 and I-515 also serve the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area.
12704,27,nevada,12704,"The I-80 crosses the northern part of Nevada, following approximately the Humboldt River route from Utah to the east and the Truckee River to the west via Reno in California."
12705,27,nevada,12705,"He has a spur path, I-580."
12706,27,nevada,12706," Nevada is also served by several U.S. highways: U.S. 6, U.S. 50, U.S. 93, U.S. 95, and U.S. 395."
12707,27,nevada,12707, There are also 189 itineraries in the state of Nevada.

12709,27,nevada,12709, Nevada is one of the few states in the United States that do not have a continuous interstate highway connecting its two major population centres – the road link between the Las Vegas and Reno regions is a combination of several different interstate and American highways.
12710,27,nevada,12710,The routing proposed by Interstate 11 could possibly remedy this.
12711,27,nevada,12711,"The state is one of the few in the country to allow semi-trailers with three trailers – which could be called a ""road train"" in Australia."
12712,27,nevada,12712,"But American versions are usually smaller, partly because they have to climb and descend a few steep mountain passes."
12713,27,nevada,12713,RTC Transit is the transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12714,27,nevada,12714,"The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a bus network across the Las Vegas Valley, including the use of The Deuce, a two-storey bus, on the Las Vegas Strip and several peripheral routes."

12719,27,nevada,12719," Las Vegas Monorail serves several casinos and Las Vegas Convention Center, east of Las Vegas Strip, near Paradise Road, with a possible extension to McCarran International Airport."
12720,27,nevada,12720," Several hotels also manage their own monorail lines, which are usually several blocks of length."
12721,27,nevada,12721, Las Vegas McCarran International Airport is the busiest airport in Nevada.
12722,27,nevada,12722,Reno Tahoe International Airport (formerly Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the state.
12723,27,nevada,12723, Nevada had a thriving solar energy sector.
12724,27,nevada,12724,An independent study conducted in 2013 concluded that solar energy users created a net benefit of $36 million.
12725,27,nevada,12725," However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission allowed the State's only electricity company, NV Energy, to charge higher tariffs and charges to solar panel users, resulting in an immediate collapse of the use of solar panels on the roof."
12726,27,nevada,12726,"In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository as the only site to be considered a permanent repository for all highly radioactive waste in the country."
12727,27,nevada,12727," Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Government of Nevada are divided into three separate departments: the Executive, composed of the Governor of Nevada and their Cabinet, as well as other elected members of the Constitution; the Legislative, composed of the Legislative Assembly of Nevada and the Senate; and the Judicial, composed of the Supreme Court of Nevada and lower courts."
12728,27,nevada,12728,"The governor is the chief magistrate of Nevada, the head of the executive department of the government of the state, and the commander-in-chief of the military forces of the state."
12729,27,nevada,12729,"The present governor is Steve Sisolak, a Democrat."
12730,27,nevada,12730,The Legislature of Nevada is a bicameral body divided into an assembly and a senator.
12731,27,nevada,12731," Members of the Assembly sit for two years, and members of the Senate for four years."
12732,27,nevada,12732,"The two chambers of the Nevada Legislative Assembly will be affected by the time limits from 2010, since senators and deputies/women will be limited to a maximum of 12 years in each chamber (by appointment or election that is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the Constitution that has recently been confirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court in a unanimous decision."
12733,27,nevada,12733," Each session of the Parliament meets for a constitutional term of 120 days for each odd year, or more if the Governor requests an extraordinary session."
12734,27,nevada,12734,"On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a female majority in its legislative assembly."
12735,27,nevada,12735,Women hold nine of the 21 seats in the Nevada Senate and 23 of the 42 seats in the Nevada Assembly.
12736,27,nevada,12736,The Supreme Court of Nevada is the Supreme Court of State and the head of the judiciary of Nevada.
12737,27,nevada,12737,"The initial jurisdiction is divided between District Courts (with general jurisdiction), Courts and Municipal Courts (both with limited jurisdiction)."
12738,27,nevada,12738,"The appeals of district courts are addressed directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which, as part of a model of derogatory jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the Court of Appeal for final resolution."
12739,27,nevada,12739,"The cities of Nevada, known as cities, have the power to legislate on anything not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to allow local authorities to integrate the cities of Nevada in order to give them more flexibility and less restrictions on the part of the Legislative Assembly.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"The municipal councils of unincorporated cities are limited local governments created either by the local county commission or by referendum, and constitute a purely consultative role and do not in any way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"In 1900, Nevada's population was the smallest of all states and decreased, as the difficulties of living in a ""barren desert"" began to prevail over the lure of money for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743,The historian Lawrence Friedman explained what happened next:
12744,27,nevada,12744," With the arrival of air conditioning for the summer and the mild winters of southern Nevada, the state's fortunes began to turn around, as for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growth in the Union."

14113,31,new_york,14113," From about 1640 to 1680, the Iroquoian peoples conducted campaigns from modern Michigan to Virginia against the Algonquian and Siwan tribes, as well as both."
14114,31,new_york,14114,"The goal was to control more land for the trapping of animals, a career that most natives had turned to in the hope of first trading with whites."
14115,31,new_york,14115," This completely altered the ethnography of the area, and most of the big game was hunted before the whites fully exploded the land."
14116,31,new_york,14116," Subsequently, the Iroquoise Confederation offered shelter to refugees from the Muscouten, Erie, Chononton, Tutelo, Saponi and Tuscarora nations."

14124,31,new_york,14124," However, when Penn died, his sons managed to take over much of their land and banish it in Ohio."
14125,31,new_york,14125," When the U.S. drafted the Indian Abduction Act, the Lenapes were moved to Missouri, while their cousins, the Mohicans, were sent to Wisconsin."
14126,31,new_york,14126,"In addition, in 1778, the United States moved Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario, although they did not stay long."

14142,31,new_york,14142," During the 17th century, Dutch trading posts were established for the trade of skins from the Lenape, Iroquois and other tribes in the colony of New Netherlands."

14144,31,new_york,14144,"The success of the ironship of Rensselaerswyck (1630), which encircled Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the colony's initial success."

14152,31,new_york,14152,"At the same time, given the strong commercial, personal and sentimental ties with Britain, many residents of New York were loyalists."
14153,31,new_york,14153,The capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the gun and powder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the siege of Boston in 1775.

14161,31,new_york,14161," After their victory, the British occupied the city of New York, making it their military and political base of operations in North America during the period of the conflict, and therefore the centre of interest of General George Washington's intelligence network."

15162,33,north_dakota,15162,"At the dawn of the First World War, it was one of North America's richest agricultural regions."
15163,33,north_dakota,15163,"But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants failed in arid conditions."

15165,33,north_dakota,15165," Between the 1930s and the late 20th century, the North Dakota population gradually declined, interrupted by a few brief increases."

16233,36,oregon,16233,"The term ""orejón"" (meaning ""great ear"") comes from the historical chronicle Relación de la Alta y Baja California (1598) written by the new Spanish Rodrigo Montezuma and refers to the Columbia River when Spanish explorers entered the current North American territory which became part of the vice-royalty of New Spain."

16236,36,oregon,16236,"It is possible that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, because there is a river in Spain called ""Arroyo del Oregón"" (which is located in the province of Ciudad Real); it is also possible that the ""j"" in the Spanish expression ""El Orejón"" was then corrupted into a ""g"", and in the context could refer to the ""aurore"" of the massive Columbia River at its mouth."

16241,36,oregon,16241,"One theory is that the name comes from the French word Ouragan (""windstorm"" or ""hurricane""), which was applied to the West River from the Indian tales of powerful Chinook winds on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from the first-hand French experience with the Chinook winds of the Great Plains."

16245,36,oregon,16245," According to Stewart, the name comes from the error of a engraver in a French map published at the beginning of the 18th century, on which the Ouisiconink River (Wisconsin) was spelled ""Ouaricon-sint"", broken on two lines with the -sint below, so there seems to be a river flowing westward called ""Ouaricon""."

17531,39,south_carolina,17531,South Carolina has always had weak executive power and a strong legislature.
17532,39,south_carolina,17532," Prior to 1865, South Carolina's governors were appointed by the General Assembly and held the title of ""President of State""."

17839,40,south_dakota,17839,"The Sioux refused to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and the war broke out after the United States did not stop white miners and settlers from entering the area."
17840,40,south_dakota,17840," Eventually, the United States won and broke the Sioux Great Reserve into five reserves, settling the Lakota there."

17849,40,south_dakota,17849,"The fertile soil was blown into massive dust storms, and several crops were completely destroyed."
17850,40,south_dakota,17850,"The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with the seizure of local banks and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, have led to the departure of many Dakotas from the south of the state."
17851,40,south_dakota,17851,The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7 per cent between 1930 and 1940.

17860,40,south_dakota,17860," Despite the increase in the population of the State and recent economic development, many rural areas have struggled over the past 50 years with the decline of the local population and the emigration of educated young adults to the major cities of South Dakota, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states."
17861,40,south_dakota,17861,Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture have greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of small family farms and the resulting economic and demographic difficulties for rural cities.
17862,40,south_dakota,17862," However, the state is often in the lead for its way of life, and Gallup's 2018 Well-Being Index named South Dakota the happiest and healthier state in the United States."

17879,40,south_dakota,17879, Five of the State's counties are within the boundaries of sovereign Indian reserves.
17880,40,south_dakota,17880," Due to the limitations of climate and land and the isolation of urban areas with higher employment opportunities, the standard of living on many South Dakota reserves is often well below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest of the nation in 2009."
17881,40,south_dakota,17881,"The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, Crow Creek Reserve, is 70 per cent, and 21 per cent of households do not have basic plumbing or kitchen equipment."
17882,40,south_dakota,17882,A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found that 58% of households on the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve did not have telephones.
17883,40,south_dakota,17883,"The isolation of reserves also impedes their ability to generate income from gambling casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centres."
17884,40,south_dakota,17884,"In 1995, the legislature passed a law to make English the ""common language"" of the State."
17885,40,south_dakota,17885," Since 2019, ""the language of the Grand Sioux Nation, consisting of three dialects, Dakota, Lakota and Nakota"" is an official language."

17892,40,south_dakota,17892,"The change was described as a ""rural leak"" as family farming declined."
17893,40,south_dakota,17893,The young people settled in the cities to find another job.
17894,40,south_dakota,17894," This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 counties in South Dakota losing their population between the 1990 census and the 2000 census."
17895,40,south_dakota,17895," During this period, nine counties suffered a population loss of more than 10 per cent, with Harding County in the northwest corner of the state losing nearly 19 per cent of its population."
17896,40,south_dakota,17896, Low birth rates and lack of young immigrants have led to an increase in the median age of many of these counties.
17897,40,south_dakota,17897,"In 24 counties, at least 20% of the population is over the age of 65, compared with a national rate of 12.8%."
17898,40,south_dakota,17898," However, the effect of rural leakage was not equally widespread in South Dakota."

18084,41,tennessee,18084," This reduced competition in politics in the state until after the adoption of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century, although unlike in the deep South, the Republicans of Tennessee still expected at least one third of the votes in state-wide elections via the East Tennessee and the Unionists Highland Rim."
18085,41,tennessee,18085,"In the 20th century, Tennessee moved from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, with the aid of massive federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Administration and, in the early 1940s, in the city of Oak Ridge."
18086,41,tennessee,18086," This city was founded just outside Knoxville to house the Manhattan project's uranium enrichment facilities, helping to build the world's first atomic bombs, two of which were dropped on Imperial Japan towards the end of World War II."
18087,41,tennessee,18087," After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became and remains an essential centre for scientific research."
18088,41,tennessee,18088,"In 2016, the Tennessee element was named for the state, largely in recognition of the roles played by Oak Ridge, Vanderbilt University and Tennessee University in the discovery of the element."
18089,41,tennessee,18089,"Tennessee's major industries include agriculture, manufacturing and tourism."
18090,41,tennessee,18090,"Poultry, soybeans and livestock are the government's main agricultural products, and major manufacturing exports include chemicals, transportation equipment and electrical equipment."
18091,41,tennessee,18091,"Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the country's most visited national park, is located in the eastern part of the state, and part of the Appalachian Trail follows about the border between Tennessee and North Carolina."
18092,41,tennessee,18092," Other major tourist attractions include the Aquarium du Tennessee and the Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel in Chattanooga; Dollywood in Pigeon Forge; the Aquarium de Ripley des Smokies and Ober Gatlinburg in Gatlinburg; the Parthenon, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville; the Distillery of Jack Daniel in Lynchburg; the residence and tomb of Elvis Presley, the Memphis Zoo, the National Museum of Civil Rights in Memphis; and the Bristol Highway in Bristol."
18093,41,tennessee,18093,"The first variant of the name that became Tennessee was recorded by Captain Juan Pardo, the Spanish explorer, when he and his men crossed an American Indian village named ""Tanasqui"" in 1567 while traveling inland from South Carolina."
18094,41,tennessee,18094,"At the beginning of the 18th century, British merchants met a city of Cherokee called Tanasi (or ""Tanase"", in the syllable : """") in the present Monroe County, Tennessee."
18095,41,tennessee,18095,"The city was located on a river of the same name (now known as Little Tennessee River), and appears on the maps as early as 1725."
18096,41,tennessee,18096,"It is not known if it was the same city as Juan Pardo's, although recent research suggests that Pardo's ""Tanasqui"" was located at the confluence of the Pigeon River and the Broad River near modern Newport."
18097,41,tennessee,18097,The meaning and origin of this word is uncertain.
18098,41,tennessee,18098, Some accounts suggest that this is a Cherokee modification to a Yuchi word earlier.
18099,41,tennessee,18099,"It is said to be a meeting place, a winding river, or a large bend river."
18100,41,tennessee,18100," According to ethnographer James Mooney, the name ""can't be analyzed"" and its meaning is lost."
18101,41,tennessee,18101,"The modern spelling, Tennessee, is attributed to James Glen, the governor of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence in the 1750s."
18102,41,tennessee,18102,"The spelling was popularized by Henry Timberlake's publication ""Draught of the Cherokee Country"" in 1765."
18103,41,tennessee,18103,"In 1788, North Carolina established Tennessee County, the third county to be established in what is now the Middle Tennessee."
18104,41,tennessee,18104,(Tennessee County was the predecessor of the present counties of Montgomery and Robertson.)
18105,41,tennessee,18105," When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state outside the territory of the south-west, it adopted the name of the ""Tennessee"" state."
18106,41,tennessee,18106,"Tennessee is known as The Volunteer State, a nickname that some claimed to have been won during the War of 1812 because of the important role played by Tennessee volunteer soldiers, especially during the Battle of New Orleans."
18107,41,tennessee,18107," Other sources differ in the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to volunteers for the war between Mexico and America from 1846 to 1848."
18108,41,tennessee,18108," This explanation is more likely, because President Polk's call for 2,600 national volunteers at the beginning of the Mexico-America war resulted in only 30,000 Tennessee volunteers, largely in response to Davy Crockett's death and the appeals of the former Tennessee governor and then Texas politician Sam Houston."
18109,41,tennessee,18109,"Tennessee borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north; North Carolina to the east; Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi to the south; Arkansas and Missouri to the west on Mississippi."

18134,41,tennessee,18134,"The western part of the Tennessee valley, where depressions become wider and ridges lower, is called the Great Valley."
18135,41,tennessee,18135,"In this valley there are many cities and two of the three urban areas of the region, Knoxville, the third largest city in the state, and Chattanooga, the fourth largest city in the state."
18136,41,tennessee,18136,"The third urban area, the three cities, which include Bristol, Johnson City and Kingsport and their surroundings, is located northeast of Knoxville."

18145,41,tennessee,18145,The Middle Tennessee was a common destination for settlers crossing the Appalachians since Virginia in the late 18th century and early 19th century.
18146,41,tennessee,18146,"An important trade route called Natchez Trace, created and used for many generations by American Indians, connects the middle Tennessee to the city of the lower Mississippi of Natchez."

18167,41,tennessee,18167,"Sportsmen and visitors are attracted to Lake Reelfoot, originally formed by the earthquakes of 1811–12 in Madrid; the stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, as well as the lotus bed covering shallow waters, give the lake a strange beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168," Most of the condition has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher altitudes in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a temperate climate of mountain or continental humid due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee climate, with southern winds accounting for most of the annual rainfall in the state."
18170,41,tennessee,18170,"In general, the condition has warm summers and mild to cold winters with generous precipitation throughout the year, with the highest average monthly precipitation generally in winter and spring between December and April."
18171,41,tennessee,18171,"The driest months are, on average, August to October."

18178,41,tennessee,18178," Although the state is far enough away from the coast to avoid any direct impact of a hurricane, the location of the state makes it likely to be affected by the remnants of tropical cyclones that weaken on the earth and can cause significant precipitation, such as tropical storm Chris in 1982 and hurricane Opal in 1995."
18179,41,tennessee,18179,"The average state is about fifty days of storms a year, some of which can be severe with great hail and devastating winds."

18182,41,tennessee,18182,"On average, there are 15 tornadoes per year in the State."
18183,41,tennessee,18183," tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the country in the percentage of total tornadoes that have died."
18184,41,tennessee,18184,"Winter storms are an occasional problem, like the famous 1993 Blizzard, although ice storms are more likely."
18185,41,tennessee,18185,"Fog is a persistent problem in some parts of the state, particularly in eastern Tennessee."
18186,41,tennessee,18186,"The capital and largest city are Nashville, although Knoxville, Kingston and Murfreesboro have served as state capitals in the past."
18187,41,tennessee,18187,The metropolitan area of 13 counties of Nashville is the largest in the state since 1990.

18192,41,tennessee,18192,"The area now known as Tennessee was first inhabited by the Paleo-Indians nearly 12,000 years ago."
18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between the first colony and the time of European contact were unknown, but several distinct cultural phases were named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 B.C.), Woodland (1000 B.C. – 1000 B.C.) and Mississippi (1000–1600 B.C.), whose chiefs of staff were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who lived in the Tennessee River valley before the migration of Cherokee into river waters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first European excursions recorded in what is now known as Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559 and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo has registered the name ""Tanasqui"" of a local Indian village, which has evolved towards the current name of the state."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,At that time Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Youchi.
18197,41,tennessee,18197," Perhaps because of devastating European diseases the Indian tribes, which would have left a vacuum of population, and also because of the expansion of the European colony in the north, the Cherokee moved south of the area now called Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European settlers spread throughout the region, Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all the Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw peoples, and finally the Cherokee peoples in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British colony in today's Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near the current Vonore."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,Fort Loudoun became the westernmost British outpost on that date.
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard of Brahm and built by forces under British captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202," After his completion, Captain Raymond Demeré abandoned command on 14 Aug. 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203,"War broke out between the British and the neighbour Overhill Cherokees, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with his surrender on 7 Aug. 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The next morning, Captain Paul Demeré and a number of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of the Eastern and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began to arrive at the end of the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,"The majority of 18th-century settlers were English or mostly English, but almost 20% were also Scottish-Irish."
18207,41,tennessee,18207," These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on land leased to Cherokee."
18208,41,tennessee,18208," During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycomore Shoals (now Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his belligerent faction of Cherokee, who were aligned with British loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209, These Cherokee renegats were designated by settlers as Chickamauga.
18210,41,tennessee,18210, They oppose the annexation by North Carolina of the Washington District and the simultaneous colonization of Transylvania further north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The lives of many settlers were spared from the first warrior attacks by the warnings of Nancy Ward, the cousin of Dragging Canoe."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The border fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a gathering place in 1780 for Overmountain's men to hike over the Appalachian Mountains, engage and defeat the British army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213, Three counties in the Washington district (now part of Tennessee) left North Carolina in 1784 and formed the state of Franklin.
18214,41,tennessee,18214," Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (now eight) had joined North Carolina in 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the region to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized in the southwestern territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In an effort to encourage settlers to move westward into the new territory, in 1787, the mother state of North Carolina ordered to cut off a road to take settlers to the Cumberland colonies — from the south end of Mount Clinch (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Trace d'Avery"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Route de la Wilderness"" across the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,Tennessee was admitted to the Union on 1 June 1796 as the 16th state.
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It is the first state created from a territory under the jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States.
18220,41,tennessee,18220," Apart from the 13 former colonies, only Vermont and Kentucky preceded the creation of Tennessee, and neither was a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, article I, section 31, stipulates that the starting point for the identification of the boundary is the extreme height of the stone mountain, at the point where the Virginia line intersects it, and leads essentially the extreme heights of the mountain ranges through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee after the Amerindian cities of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (mount Unicoi) to the southern boundary of the State; all the territory, lands and waters to the west of the said line are included within the limits and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also specified that the boundaries and jurisdiction of the State would include the future acquisition of land, reference to possible land exchanges with other States, or the acquisition of territory west of the Mississippi River."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As other white settlers settled in Tennessee, they became increasingly in conflict with Amerindian tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224," During the administration of U.S. President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."
18225,41,tennessee,18225,"American troops forced them to walk from ""emigration depots"" in eastern Tennessee, like Fort Cass, to Indian territory farther west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma."
18226,41,tennessee,18226," During this relocation, approximately 4,000 Cherokees died along the west road."
18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi, ""the track where we screamed""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Indians forced to emigrate as a result of the expulsion efforts of the Indians from the United States, so the expression ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indians, particularly among the ""Five Civilized Tribes""."
18229,41,tennessee,18229,The expression was derived from a description of the previous emigration of the Choctaw Nation.
18230,41,tennessee,18230,"In February 1861 secessionists of the Tennessee government, led by Governor Isham Harris, asked for approval of an agreement to break ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a margin of 54-46%."
18231,41,tennessee,18231,"The strongest opposition to secession came from Eastern Tennessee, which later attempted to form a separate state aligned with the Union."
18232,41,tennessee,18232," Following the confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's appeal for Tennessee and other states in response, Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization, submitted a secession order to the General Assembly, and made direct openings to the confederate government."

18470,41,tennessee,18470,"The first was adopted in 1796, the year Tennessee joined the Union, and the second was adopted in 1834."
18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution prohibits martial law in its jurisdiction.
18472,41,tennessee,18472, This may be the result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by the Union (North) forces of the US government after the American civil war.
18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee politics, like that of most American states, is dominated by Republican and Democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474," Historian Dewey W. Grantham trace divisions in the state until the period of the American civil war; for decades after, a third east of the state was strongly republican and two thirds Western voted mostly democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475," This division was linked to the structure of the State in agriculture, plantations and servitude."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern part was made up of Yeoman farmers, but the middle and western Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton, which depended on slave labour."
18477,41,tennessee,18477, These areas were defined as democratic after the war.
18478,41,tennessee,18478," During the reconstruction, freed men and former free-coloured people were granted the right to vote; most of them joined the Republican Party."
18479,41,tennessee,18479," Many African-Americans have been elected to local offices, and some to state posts."
18480,41,tennessee,18480," After the reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have a competitive party policy, but in the 1880s, the White-majority state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a voting fee for the registration of voters."
18481,41,tennessee,18481," They have been used to deprive most African Americans of their rights, and their power in state and local politics has been significantly reduced."
18482,41,tennessee,18482,"In 1900, African Americans accounted for 23.8 per cent of the state's population, concentrated in the Middle and Western Tennessee."
18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of city commission government on the basis of a broad vote for a few positions on a board of directors of the Commission; several cities adopted this as another way of limiting African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,"In 1913, the State Parliament enacted a bill allowing cities to adopt the structure without legislative approval."
18485,41,tennessee,18485," After the abandonment of the right to vote of the blacks, the Republican Party in Tennessee became a mainly white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, with the exception of two republican landslides at the national level of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee strongly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio governor James Cox, and in 1928, when he voted more resolutely for Herbert Hoover over New York governor Al Smith), the state was part of the solid democratic South until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In this post-war decade, he voted twice for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during the Second World War."
18488,41,tennessee,18488," Since then, more state voters have turned to Republican support, and candidates for the democratic presidency have carried Tennessee only four times."
18489,41,tennessee,18489,"In 1960, African-Americans accounted for 16.45 per cent of the population of the state."
18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was only after the mid-1960s and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new mechanisms, such as the governments of the major municipal commissions, were adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491,The former government.
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former U.S. senator Bill Brock won in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among the Whites for state-wide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493," Since 1970, Tennessee has chosen governors from various parties."
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"At the beginning of the 21st century, Republican voters controlled most of the state, especially in rural and suburban areas outside cities; the democratic force was mainly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and was particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter area includes a large African-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496," Historically, the Republicans had their greatest strength in Eastern Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"The 1st and 2nd districts of Tennessee, based respectively in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, are among the few republican historic districts of the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498, Residents of these districts supported the Union on Confederation during the civil war
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first one has been in Republican hands permanently since 1881, and the Republicans (or their predecessors) have held it for all except four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The second was held permanently by the Republicans or their predecessors since 1859.

18502,41,tennessee,18502," Senator of Tennessee, did not bear his original state, an unusual event, but revealing the strengthening of republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503," Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, with his margin of victory in the state rising from 4% in 2000 to 14% in 2004."
18504,41,tennessee,18504," Candidates for the democratic presidency of southern states, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, are generally better off than their northern Tennessee counterparts, especially among voters split outside metropolitan areas."

18507,41,tennessee,18507,"In the 2008 elections, the Republican Party took control of the two chambers of the Tennessee legislature for the first time since the reconstruction."
18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, about 30 per cent of the state's electorate identified itself as independent."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"Baker v. Carr (1962) of the United States Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one voice"", requiring that state legislatures re-district the distribution of Congress according to decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,"He also demanded that the two chambers of state legislatures be population-based for representation, not geographical districts such as counties."
18511,41,tennessee,18511, This case was the result of a lawsuit challenging the long-standing rural bias in the allocation of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512," After decades of under-representation of urban populations in many state legislatures, this important decision has led to increased (and proportional) importance in the policy of the State by cities and, eventually, the suburbs, legislators and public office holders in relation to their population within the State."
18513,41,tennessee,18513,"The decision also applies to many other states that have long been under the control of rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont and Montana."
18514,41,tennessee,18514,"The State of Tennessee has four law enforcement entities: the Tennessee Road Patrol, the Tennessee Wildlife Agency, the Tennessee Investigation Bureau and the Tennessee Environment and Conservation Department."

18520,41,tennessee,18520,The Tennessee Constitution requires that every county have an elected Sheriff.
18521,41,tennessee,18521,"In 94 of the 95 counties, the Sheriff is the chief of law enforcement in the county and has jurisdiction over the whole county."
18522,41,tennessee,18522," Each Sheriff's Office is responsible for the service of warrants, court security, prison operations and primary law enforcement in unincorporated areas of a county, as well as support to municipal police services."
18523,41,tennessee,18523,Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police service in order to provide police services within the limits of their organization.

18528,41,tennessee,18528,The death penalty exists in Tennessee at various times since the creation of the State.
18529,41,tennessee,18529," Prior to 1913, the method of execution was hung."
18530,41,tennessee,18530," From 1913 to 1915, executions were interrupted, but they were restored in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531," From 1972 to 1978, the Supreme Court found capital punishment unconstitutional (Furman v. Georgia) and there were no other executions."
18532,41,tennessee,18532,"The death penalty resumed in 1978, although prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 were for the most part sentenced to life imprisonment."
18533,41,tennessee,18533," From 1916 to 1960, the state executed 125 prisoners."

18589,42,texas,18589,Archaeologists found that three large indigenous cultures lived in this territory and reached their development summit before the first European contact.
18590,42,texas,18590,The aim was to:
18591,42,texas,18591," When the Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Aboriginal people divided into several smaller tribes."
18592,42,texas,18592," These were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan."
18593,42,texas,18593,"The peoples of Puebloan Uto-Aztecan lived near Rio Grande in the western part of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived within the country, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mainly centered along the Gulf coast."
18594,42,texas,18594,"At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the Aranamas, lived in southern Texas."
18595,42,texas,18595,"The entire cultural group, mainly centered in north-eastern Mexico, is now extinct."
18596,42,texas,18596,It is difficult to say who originally lived in the northwestern region of the state.
18597,42,texas,18597,"At the time when the region came to be explored, it belonged to the well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztécan people that had transformed into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century."
18598,42,texas,18598,"It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siwans."
18599,42,texas,18599," There was no dominant culture in the present Texas region, and many peoples lived in it."

18601,42,texas,18601,"The name Texas derives from táysha, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, which means ""friends"" or ""allies""."
18602,42,texas,18602,"The area was mostly controlled by the Spaniards during the first two centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution."
18603,42,texas,18603," They were not particularly kind to their native populations, let alone to the Caddoans, who had no confidence because their culture was divided between the Spanish and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604," When the Spaniards briefly succeeded in conquering the colony of Louisiana, they decided to change tactics and try to be extremely friends with the Indians, which they continued even after the French had taken over the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605," Following the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, the United States inherited this strange circumstance."
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred the American company and almost all of their population migrated to the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spaniards felt swindled after spending so much time and effort and began to try to attract the Caddo back, promising them even more land."
18608,42,texas,18608," Apparently, without knowing how they arrived, the United States (which had begun to convince the tribes to separate from the Whites by selling everything and moving west since they bought Louisiana) faced an overflow of indigenous peoples from Missouri and Arkansas and had been able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced populations to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609," They included Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, among others, who had all come to consider the Caddoans as saviors, making these peoples very influential."

18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans have always been meaningless when questioned, the Texan and American authorities in the region have never been able to find any solid evidence linking them to it, and often it was so far from Caddoan lands, it made little sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,"It seems very likely that these are false flag attacks aimed at triggering a cascade effect in order to force the indigenous people under Caddoan's influence to enter into armed conflict without violating any treaty, preferably on the Spanish side."
18618,42,texas,18618," Although no evidence was found as to who the culprit was, Texas officials at the time tried several times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check."
18619,42,texas,18619," Moreover, the Caddoans have never turned to violence because of this, with the exception of self-defence cases."

18636,42,texas,18636," Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civil colony in the area."
18637,42,texas,18637,The hostile indigenous tribes and the distance of neighbouring Spanish settlements discouraged the settlers from moving to the area.

18649,42,texas,18649,"In hopes that more settlers will reduce Comanche's almost constant raids, Mexican Texas has liberalized its immigration policies to allow immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain."

18832,42,texas,18832,"At the beginning of its formation, the nascent basin of the Gulf of Mexico was restricted and sea water often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of the Jurassic age."
18833,42,texas,18833, These salt deposits form salt domes and are located in eastern Texas along the Gulf coast.
18834,42,texas,18834,Outcrops in eastern Texas consist of cretaceous and paleogenic sediments that contain significant deposits of eocene lignite.

18851,42,texas,18851,Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only under rare circumstances.
18852,42,texas,18852,"It is worth noting the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm when 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average temperature was 65°F in December."
18853,42,texas,18853," Maximum summer temperatures are on average 80°F (26°C) in the mountains of western Texas and on Galveston Island at approximately 100°F (38°C) in the Rio Grande Valley, but most regions of Texas see constant high summer temperatures in the 90°F (32°C) range."
18854,42,texas,18854,Summer temperatures at night range from 50 °F (14 °C) in the mountains of western Texas to 80 °F (27 °C) in Galveston.

18864,42,texas,18864," Hurricane Galveston of 1900 subsequently devastated this city, killing about 8,000 people, and even up to 12,000 people."
18865,42,texas,18865, That makes it the most deadly natural disaster in the history of the United States.
18866,42,texas,18866,"In 2017, Hurricane Harvey struck Rockport as a Category 4 hurricane and caused significant damage."
18867,42,texas,18867,"The storm lasted a long time, allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain on the Greater Houston area and surrounding counties."
18868,42,texas,18868,The result has been widespread and catastrophic floods that have flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.

19365,43,utah,19365," Among the most important settlements in Utah are St. George, Logan and Manti (where the settlers completed the first three Utah temples, each having started after but completed several years before the larger and better-known Salt Lake City temple was completed in 1893), as well as Parowan, Cedar City, Bluff, Moab, Vernal, Fillmore (which served as the territorial capital between 1850 and 1856), Nephi, Levan, Spanish Fork, Springville, Provo Bench (now Orem), Pleasant Grove, American Fork, Lehi, Sandy, Murray, Jordan, Centerville, Farmington, Huntsville, Kaysville, Grantsville, Tooele, Roy, Brigham City and many other smaller towns and settlements."
19366,43,utah,19366,"Young had an expansionist view of the territory that he and Mormon's pioneers were settling in, calling Deseret, who, according to the Book of Mormon, was an ancient word for ""the honey bee""."
19367,43,utah,19367," This is symbolized by the hive on the flag of Utah, and by the motto of the state, ""Industrie""."
19368,43,utah,19368,"The territory of Utah was much smaller than the proposed state of Desert, but it still contained all the present states of Nevada and Utah, as well as parts of modern Wyoming and Colorado."
19369,43,utah,19369,"It was created with the 1850 compromise, and Fillmore, named after President Billard Fillmore, was named the capital."

19392,43,utah,19392,"As a result of the American Civil War, federal troops were removed from Utah territory in 1861."
19393,43,utah,19393,It was an advantage for the local economy because the army sold everything in the camp for cents on the dollar before marching east to join the war.
19394,43,utah,19394,The territory was then left in the hands of LDS until Patrick E. Connor arrived with a regiment of volunteers from California in 1862.

19406,43,utah,19406, They published their own books in 1875.
19407,43,utah,19407," These books and the conferences of Ann Eliza Young were credited with the adoption by the United States Congress of anti-polygamy laws by newspapers across the United States as recorded in ""The Ann Eliza Young Vindicator"", a brochure that detailed Ms Young's travels and the warm reception throughout her lecture tour."
19408,43,utah,19408,"T. B. H. Stenhouse, former polygamous of Utah Mormon, a mormon missionary for thirteen years and owner of a Salt Lake City newspaper, finally left Utah and wrote The Rocky Mountain Saints."

19450,43,utah,19450,Western Utah is primarily an arid desert with a basin and a range topography.
19451,43,utah,19451,Small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape.
19452,43,utah,19452,"The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being relatively flat following the formation of the bed of the old Lake Bonneville."

19482,43,utah,19482,"The main source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, usually on the path to major Pacific storms from October to May."
19483,43,utah,19483,"In the summer, the state, especially the south and east of Utah, is on the path to monsoon moisture from the Gulf of California."
19484,43,utah,19484," Most lowland areas receive less than 12 inches (305 mm) of precipitation per year, although corridor I-15, including the densely populated Wasatch Front, receives approximately 15 inches (381 mm)."
19485,43,utah,19485,"The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest area of the state, with less than 5 inches (127 mm)."
19486,43,utah,19486,Snowfall is common in all valleys except in southern valleys.
19487,43,utah,19487," Although St. George receives only about 3 inches (76 mm) per year, Salt Lake City sees about 60 inches (1,524 mm), increased by snow from the Great Salt Lake effect, increasing total snowfall to the south, southeast and east of the lake."

19491,43,utah,19491,"The ever-deep snowpowder led the Utah ski industry to adopt the slogan ""The biggest snow on earth"" in the 1980s."
19492,43,utah,19492,"In winter, temperature inversions are a common phenomenon in the lower Utah basins and valleys, resulting in thick fog and fog that can last weeks at a time, especially in the Uintah basin."
19493,43,utah,19493," Although at other times of the year its air quality is good, winter reversals give Salt Lake City one of the worst winter pollution in the country."
19494,43,utah,19494,"Previous studies have shown a widespread decline in snow quantity above Utah, accompanied by a decrease in the snow-precipitation ratio, while anecdotal claims have been made that the measured changes in Utah snow quantity are misleading and do not reflect actual changes."
19495,43,utah,19495,"A 2012 study found that the proportion of winter precipitation (January to March) that falls as snow has decreased by nine percent over the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in precipitation and a slight decrease in snowfall."
19496,43,utah,19496," Meanwhile, the depth of snow observed across Utah decreased and was accompanied by a steady decrease in snow cover and surface albedo."

19500,43,utah,19500, January mean high temperatures range from about 30°F (−1°C) in some northern valleys to almost 55°F (13°C) in St. George.
19501,43,utah,19501," Temperatures below 0°F (−18°C) should be expected occasionally in most parts of the state in most years, although some regions often see it (for example, the city of Randolph has an average of about fifty days a year with such low temperatures)."
19502,43,utah,19502,"In July, average heights range from 85 to 100°F (29 to 38°C)."
19503,43,utah,19503," However, low humidity and high elevation usually result in large temperature variations, resulting in cool nights on most summer days."
19504,43,utah,19504,"The record temperature in Utah was 118°F (48°C), recorded south of St. George on 4 July 2007, and the low record was -69°F (−56°C), recorded at Peter Sinks in the Northern Bear Mountains of Utah on 1 February 1985."

19511,43,utah,19511,"The tornadoes are uncommon in Utah, with an average of two striking the state each year, rarely more intensity than the EF1."
19512,43,utah,19512,"An exception to note, however, was the unprecedented F2 Salt Lake City Tornado which moved directly through downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999, killing one person, wounding another sixty, and causing approximately $170 million in damage."
19513,43,utah,19513,The only other victim reported in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on 6 July 1884.
19514,43,utah,19514,"The last tornado of the above intensity (E)F0 occurred on September 8, 2002, when an F2 tornado struck Manti."

19996,44,vermont,19996," Today, many of Vermont's older trees are about 75 years old, dating back to the aftermath of this storm."

20004,44,vermont,20004, They were first allowed to vote in municipal elections and then in state parliamentary elections.
20005,44,vermont,20005,"In 1964, the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Reynolds v. Sims required ""one man, one vote"" in all states."
20006,44,vermont,20006,"It found that many State legislatures had not been reclassified and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated urban and industrial areas."
20007,44,vermont,20007," Furthermore, it found that many States had an upper chamber based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties."
20008,44,vermont,20008, This has given disproportionate power to rural and slightly populated counties.
20009,44,vermont,20009,The court held that there was no basis for such a structure.
20010,44,vermont,20010, Significant changes in political distribution have taken place in Vermont and other affected states.
20011,44,vermont,20011," This decision requires that districts be re-evaluated after each census and based on a roughly equal population, rather than geography (such as counties)."
20012,44,vermont,20012,"In the context of the redistribution, residents of urban areas had to obtain an equitable share of the distribution of the two houses in each State."
20013,44,vermont,20013,"Vermont and other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as had several southern states in those years, which had not been redistributed since the beginning of the century."
20014,44,vermont,20014,"Up to that time, the distribution of the upper chambers was often based on county courts, which had given more power to rural counties and had not taken into account the increase in population in urban areas."

20028,44,vermont,20028,"The demographic evolution between those who have multi-generational links with the state and those who are newcomers, bringing different values with them, has led to some tension between the two perspectives."

20032,44,vermont,20032,"All the towns of Chittenden have increased, except Burlington."
20033,44,vermont,20033,"More than 180 cities have experienced a decline, which has not occurred since the middle of the 19th century."
20034,44,vermont,20034,"Note: Births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."

20043,44,vermont,20043,"Partly because it has a small population for an American state, it has the smallest number of Hispanics of any state in the country."

20045,44,vermont,20045,"The linguists have identified the speech patterns found among the Vermonters as belonging to Western New England English, a dialect of New England English, which presents the complete pronunciation of all r sounds, pronouncing horse and wrapping the same, and pronouncing vowels as father and annoying the same, none of which are traditionally shared features in neighbouring Eastern New England English."
20046,44,vermont,20046," Some rural speakers realize t as a glottal stop (mitten sounds like ""mi'in"" and Vermont like ""Vermon"")."
20047,44,vermont,20047,"A decreasing portion of the Vermont population, generally rural and masculine, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g."
20048,44,vermont,20048," cows with an elevated vowel like [khyz] and climb with a sustained vowel, somewhat rounded like [yyd])."
20049,44,vermont,20049," Eastern New England English, also found in New Hampshire, Maine and Eastern Massachusetts, was common in eastern Vermont in the mid-20th century and before, but it became rare."
20050,44,vermont,20050," This accent reduces the sound r to words ending in r (the farmer sounds like ""farm-uh"") and adds a r sound to some words ending in a vowel (idea sounds like ""idee-er"") was common."
20051,44,vermont,20051, These features in eastern Vermont seem to have been inherited from the ancestors of West Country and Scottish-Irish.
20052,44,vermont,20052,"In the 21st century, Protestants (30 per cent) and Catholics (22 per cent) made up the majority of those who declared a religious preference, with 37 per cent who declared no religion, the highest rate of irreligion in all states."

20095,44,vermont,20095,"The dairy stable remains an emblematic image of Vermont, but the 87% decrease in the number of dairy farms active between 1947 and 2003 means that the preservation of dairy stables increasingly depends on a commitment to preserve a legacy rather than a fundamental need in the agricultural economy."

21075,46,washington,21075,"The main factors that determine Washington's climate are the large semi-permanent high-pressure and low-pressure systems of the northern Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In the spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the northern Pacific Ocean, causing a clockwise spiral of air."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means that the prevailing northwestern winds bring relatively fresh air and a predictable drought season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In the fall and winter, a system of low-pressure cyclones takes over in the northern Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,"The inward spiral air in the opposite direction of the clockwise makes the prevailing winds of Washington come from the southwest, and brings relatively warm and humid air masses and a likely wet season."
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is commonly used to describe the events of the atmospheric river, where repeated storm systems are led by this persistent cyclone in the tropical and quasi-tropical regions of the Pacific in the northwest Pacific."

21084,46,washington,21084, Southern oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085," During the El Niño phase, the jet enters the United States further south by California, so late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snow."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet across the Pacific Northwest, so Washington has more rain and snow than the average."

21092,46,washington,21092,"In the area of the rain shadow east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093, Precipitation then increases eastward towards the Rocky Mountains (about 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and waterfalls aggravate this climate pattern by causing an orographical uplift of blowing air masses inside the Pacific Ocean, resulting in high precipitation levels on the wind side of the mountains and low levels on the left side."
21095,46,washington,21095, This occurs most widely around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases, slopes facing the southwest wind receive high precipitation and mild and cool temperatures."

21102,46,washington,21102," Thus, instead of rainforests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry grasslands, shrub steppe and sand dunes."
21103,46,washington,21103,The mean annual temperature ranges from 51°F (11°C) on the Pacific coast to 40°F (4°C) in the northeast.

21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicas also began to designate themselves as Cherokees shortly afterwards, showing an apparent additional fusion."

21517,47,west_virginia,21517," During the war, settlers in western Virginia were usually active Whigs and many served in the Continental Army."
21518,47,west_virginia,21518," However, the Claypool rebellion of 1780–81, in which a group of men refused to pay the taxes imposed by the Continental Army, witnessed the tenacity of the war in what became Western Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,The social conditions in western Virginia were quite different from those in the eastern part of the state.
21520,47,west_virginia,21520,"The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable part of the immigration came through Pennsylvania and included Germans, Protestant Scottish-Irish, and settlers from more northerly states."
21521,47,west_virginia,21521,The eastern and southern counties were established primarily by eastern Virginians.
21522,47,west_virginia,21522," During the American Revolution, the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was presented in Congress, on the grounds that the mountains had a barrier almost impassable to the east."
21523,47,west_virginia,21523,"The wilderness of the country made slavery unprofitable, and time only increased the social, political, economic and cultural differences (see Tuckahoe-Cohee) between the two sections of Virginia."

21526,47,west_virginia,21526," However, Western reforms have been rejected by the leaders of the eastern Alleghenies who ""dive into political power in an effort to preserve their way of plantation dependent on the enslavement of the Blacks""."
21527,47,west_virginia,21527, Virginia's leaders maintained a property qualification to effectively deny the right to vote to poor farmers in the West whose families have done much of the agricultural work themselves.
21528,47,west_virginia,21528,"In addition, the 1829–30 convention granted slave counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population by allocating state representation in the United States House of Representatives."
21529,47,west_virginia,21529,"As a result, all but one of the counties west of the Alleghenies voted to reject the constitution, which was nonetheless adopted because of the support of the East."
21530,47,west_virginia,21530,The failure of the Eastern planter elite to carry out constitutional reforms exacerbated the East-West sectarianism existing in Virginia and contributed to its subsequent division.

21536,47,west_virginia,21536,"The representation of Senators was arbitrarily set at 50 seats, with the West receiving 20 and the East receiving 30 senators."
21537,47,west_virginia,21537," This was made acceptable to the West by a provision which required the General Assembly to resume its representation on the basis of the white population in 1865, or to refer the matter to a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the East has also given itself a tax advantage by requiring a real and real property tax, except for slaves."
21539,47,west_virginia,21539," Slaves under the age of 12 are not taxed and slaves over that age are taxed at only $300, a fraction of their real value."
21540,47,west_virginia,21540," However, the small farmers had all their property, animals and land taxed at their full value."
21541,47,west_virginia,21541," Despite this tax and lack of internal improvements in the West, the vote was 75,748 in favour and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542," Most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the west."
21543,47,west_virginia,21543," Given these differences, many in the West had long been considering a separate state."
21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men such as lawyer Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont had for a long time flouted under the political domination of the slaves of Tidewater and Piedmont."
21545,47,west_virginia,21545,"In addition to the differences on the abolition of slavery, he and his allies felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend money on the necessary internal improvements in the West, such as towering towers and railways."
21546,47,west_virginia,21546,West Virginia was the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate State (Virginia) during the American Civil War.
21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the 1861 Virginia Secession Agreement voted for the secession of the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwest corner (who eventually became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favour of the secession order, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548," Almost immediately after this vote, a mass meeting in Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to an assembly to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"At the first meeting, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, although more than a third of the delegates were from the North Panhandle region."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550," Soon, there was a division of feelings."
21551,47,west_virginia,21551," Some delegates led by John S. Carlile favoured the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that since Virginia's secession had not yet been adopted by the required referendum (as happened on 23 May), such action would constitute a revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if the Virginians adopted the secession order (of which there was little doubt), another convention including the elected members of the legislature would meet at Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On May 23, 1861, the secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted in favour."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on 11 June and stated that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its actions were null and void and that all those who had acceded to it had left their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never elected by public ballot to act on behalf of West Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of its 103 members, 33 were elected to the General Assembly of Virginia on 23 May."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557," These included United States senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and others who had left their offices to meet at Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558," Other members ""were chosen in an even more irregular way – some at mass meetings, others by county committee and others were apparently self-designated""."
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,A law for the reorganization of the Government was adopted on 19 June.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The next day, the delegates of the assembly chose Francis H. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, and elected other officers of a rival state government and two U.S. senators (Willy and Carlile) to replace the secessionists before adjourning."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,"The Washington federal government, D.C., quickly recognized the new government and sat on the two new senators."
21562,47,west_virginia,21562, Thus there were two state governments in Virginia: one promising allegiance to the United States and the other to Confederation.
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The Second Wheeling Convention had been suspended until 6 August, then reconvened on 20 August and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new State and a convention to govern a constitution if the vote were to be favourable."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"In the elections of 24 October 1861, 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The results of the elections were questioned, as the Union army occupying the area and the Union troops were stationed at numerous polls to prevent confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"It was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in confederate soldiers' camps, which elected rival state officials such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567, Most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the North Panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"More than 50,000 votes were cast on the Secession Order, but the vote on State status did not exceed 19,000 votes."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, where Wheeling is located, only a quarter of the registered voters voted."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote, since two-thirds of West Virginia's territory had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,The majority of the votes in the counties in favour of secession were cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from those counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572," Despite this controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to draft a new Constitution for the new State, beginning on 26 November 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573," During this constitutional convention, one Mr. Lamb from Ohio County and one Mr. Carskadon claimed that, in Hampshire County, out of only 195 votes, 39 were expressed by state citizens; the others were illegally deposited by EU soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One of the key figures was the Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools, as well as to limit the movement of slaves to the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The proposal on education was successful, but the convention presented the proposals on slavery before completing its work on 18 February 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution is more closely inspired by Ohio than Virginia, adopting a model of township government rather than Virginia's ""courthouse clicks"" than Carlile criticizes, and a compromise required by the Kanawha region (lawyers Charleston Benjamin Smith and Brown) allows counties and municipalities to vote for subsidies for railways or other improvement agencies."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578,"The resulting instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on April 11, 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,On 13 May 1862 the reorganized government state parliament approved the formation of the new state.
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,An application for admission to the Union was submitted to Congress by Senator Waitman Willey of the restored Virginia government.
21581,47,west_virginia,21581," However, Senator Carlile tried to sabotage the bill, first trying to expand the borders of the new state to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then defeat the Willey amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling law was approved by President Abraham Lincoln who admitted West Virginia, provided that a provision for the progressive abolition of slavery was included in its constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle insisted with the Wheeling Intelligencer and had also written to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584," While many felt that the admission of West Virginia as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln expressed his opinion on the admission of West Virginia by concluding that ""the organ that consents to the admission of West Virginia is the legislature of Virginia,"" and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and timely."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,"The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the request to abolish the federal enabling legislation was met."
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,The revised Constitution was adopted on 26 March 1863 and on 20 April 1863 President Lincoln issued a proclamation in which he admitted the State 60 days later on 20 June 1863.
21587,47,west_virginia,21587," Meanwhile, officers from the new state were chosen, while Gov."
21588,47,west_virginia,21588,"Pierpont moves its pro-Union capital Virginia to Alexandria occupied by the Union, where it asserts and exercises jurisdiction over all remaining counties of Virginia in federal lines."
21589,47,west_virginia,21589,The constitutionality of the formation of the new state was subsequently referred to the Supreme Court of the United States in Virginia v. West Virginia.
21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties, located on the Potomac east of the mountains, in 1863, with the agreement of the reorganized Virginia government, voted in favour of annexation to West Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591, Many voters in counties strongly in favour of secession were absent from the confederate army at the time of the vote and refused to recognize the transfer upon their return.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly repealed the act of secession and, in 1866, brought an action against West Virginia by asking the court to declare the counties part of Virginia, which would have declared the admission of West Virginia unconstitutional."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593," Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress adopted a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Western Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595," During the Civil War, General Union forces George B. McClellan took possession of most of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating in the Battle of Rich Mountain, and control of the Union was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863 General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 confederates, raided a considerable part of the state and burned the Pierpont Library, although Senator Willey fled their capture."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,"Bands of guerrillas burned and looted in some sections, and were not completely eliminated until after the end of the war."
21598,47,west_virginia,21598,"The counties of the Eastern Panhandle were more affected by the war, as military control of the region changed hands several times."
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The region that became West Virginia has indeed provided about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, about 22,000 to 25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to remove the voting rights of the Confederates' return in order to maintain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said that if it were not enacted, he would lose the 500-vote election."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of the Confederates could also be confiscated and, in 1866, a constitutional amendment was adopted which deprived all those who had helped and comforted Confederation."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prompted a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,"The Democratic Party gained control in 1870 and, in 1871, the constitutional amendment of 1866 was repealed."
21605,47,west_virginia,21605," However, the first steps towards this change were taken by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,On 22 August 1872 a new constitution was adopted.
21607,47,west_virginia,21607," From the reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states challenged the state's share of the debts of the pre-war government of Virginia, which had been primarily committed to finance public infrastructure improvements, such as canals, roads and railways, under the direction of the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,"The Virginians, led by former Confederate General William Mahone, formed a political coalition based on this: the Adjuster Party."
21609,47,west_virginia,21609," Although the first constitution of West Virginia provided for the taking over of part of Virginia's debt, the negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were unsuccessful, and in 1871 Virginia financed two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily allocated the rest to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally resolved in 1915, when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The last instalment of this sum was paid in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612," Following the reconstruction, the new 35th State benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613," Saltpeter caves were used throughout Appalachia for ammunition production; the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the Saltpeter Trail, a chain of limestone caves containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were returned and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail extends from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the road in the town of Union, Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615," Nearly half of these caves are on the west side of Virginia, including the Organ Cave and the Haynes Cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"In the late 18th century, Haynes Cave saltpet miners found large animal bones in the deposits."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617," They were sent by a local historian and border soldier, Colonel John Stuart, to Thomas Jefferson."
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were called Megalonyx jeffersonii, or great claw, and became known as Jefferson's three-finger laziness."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,It was declared the official fossil of the state of West Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The official rock of the state of Western Virginia is bituminous coal, and the official gemstone of the state is silicified fossil Mississippi Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621," Limestone has also produced a useful, generally small, quarry industry and softer, high-calcium seams have been burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622," This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years, a specific portion of the C & O railway transported limestone to Clifton Forge, Virginia, as an industrial stream."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"The extraction of salt had been under way since the 18th century, although it played largely in the era of the American civil war, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a precious commodity of the first Confederate forces, and later of the Union."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In the years that followed, more sophisticated extraction methods would restore West Virginia's role as the leading salt producer."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625," However, in the second half of the 19th century there was still an even larger treasure that was not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626,It would feed much of the industrial revolution in the United States and the steam ships of many of the world's marines.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627, Residents (both Amerindians and the first European settlers) have long known the underlying coal and could use it for heating and fuel.
21628,47,west_virginia,21628," However, for a long time, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629," After the war, with the new railways came a practical method of transporting large quantities of coal to the expansion of American and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630,"As the anthracite mines in northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play during the same period, investors and industrialists concentrated new interests in West Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted have studied potential coal fields and invested in land mining projects and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) across the state to the new town of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River coalfield.
21633,47,west_virginia,21633," Soon, the C&O was building its huge wharf at Newport News, Virginia, on the great harbour of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new owners of the former Atlantic Railway, Mississippi and Ohio (AM&O), which extended south of Virginia from Norfolk, had clear views of the state of the mountains, where the owners owned large lands."
21635,47,west_virginia,21635," Their railway was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railway city was developed in Roanoke to manage the planned expansion."
21636,47,west_virginia,21636," After his new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party travelled on horseback and first-hand saw the rich bituminous seam of coal, which Kimball's wife named Pocahontas, the N&W redirected his expansion project westward to reach him."
21637,47,west_virginia,21637," Soon, the N&W also sailed from new coal jetties on Hampton Roads."
21638,47,west_virginia,21638,"In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and western railway lines, the important coal centre of Bluefield, West Virginia was founded."
21639,47,west_virginia,21639,"The capital of the Pocahontas coalfield, this city will remain the largest city in the southern part of the state for decades."
21640,47,west_virginia,21640,"He shares a sister city of the same name, Bluefield, Virginia."
21641,47,west_virginia,21641,"In the northern part of the state and elsewhere, the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities."
21642,47,west_virginia,21642,The B&O developed coal jetties in Baltimore and several locations in the Great Lakes.
21643,47,west_virginia,21643,"The Western Maryland Railway (WM), Southern Railway (SOU) and the Louisville and Nashville Railway (L&N) are other major coal rail carriers."
21644,47,west_virginia,21644,"A delayer, the Virginian Railway (VGN), was particularly notable."
21645,47,west_virginia,21645,"In 1900, only the most rugged terrain in southwestern Virginia was at any distance from existing railways and mining."
21646,47,west_virginia,21646,"In this area west of the New River coalfield, in Raleigh and Wyoming counties, is the Winding Gulf coalfield, later promoted as a billion-dollar coalfield."
21647,47,west_virginia,21647,"Ansted's protégé was William Nelson Page (1854-1932), a civil engineer and mining director in Fayette County."
21648,47,west_virginia,21648,"The former Governor of West Virginia, William A. MacCorkle, described him as a man who knew the land ""as a farmer knows a field."""
21649,47,west_virginia,21649," Starting in 1898, Page teamed up with northern and European investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area."
21650,47,west_virginia,21650," They acquired extensive land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short-line railway chartered to extend between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka, a distance of approximately 80 miles (130 km)."
21651,47,west_virginia,21651," Although the Deepwater Plan should have provided a competitive marine transportation contract by either railway, the managers of the two major railways did not appreciate the project."
21652,47,west_virginia,21652,"In secret collusion, everyone refused to negotiate favorable rates with Page, and they did not offer to buy their railway, as they had many other short lines."
21653,47,west_virginia,21653," However, if the presidents of C&O and N&W thought they could kill the Page project, they had to be wrong."
21654,47,west_virginia,21654,"One of Page's silent investor-partners was the million-dollar industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a director of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, and an old hand in the development of natural resources and transportation."
21655,47,west_virginia,21655,"Master in competitive ""war"", Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his efforts and also had ""deep pockets."""
21656,47,west_virginia,21656," Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks to the east of Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost."
21657,47,west_virginia,21657,"At the completion of the Virginian Railway (VGN) in 1909, no fewer than three railways shipped ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads."
21658,47,west_virginia,21658,West Virginia coal was also in high demand in Great Lakes harbours.
21659,47,west_virginia,21659,"The NGV and N&W have finally become part of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the well-designed 21st century NGV lanes continue to provide a favourable gradient for Hampton roads."
21660,47,west_virginia,21660,"As coal mining and related activities became important employment activities in the State, working conditions, safety issues and economic concerns arose."
21661,47,west_virginia,21661," Even in the twenty-first century, mining safety and environmental concerns continue to be a problem for the state whose coal continues to supply power plants in many other states."
21662,47,west_virginia,21662," Coal is not the only precious mineral found in West Virginia, since the state was the site of the discovery in 1928 of the 34.48 carat Jones diamond (6.896 g)."
21663,47,west_virginia,21663," Located in the Appalachian Range, West Virginia covers an area of 62,754.8 km2, with 62,361.0 km2 of land and 393.8 km2 of water, making it the 41st state of the United States."
21664,47,west_virginia,21664,"West Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest, and Kentucky in the southwest."
21665,47,west_virginia,21665," Its longest border is with Virginia 381 miles (613 km), followed by Ohio 243 miles (391 km), Maryland 174 miles (280 km), Pennsylvania 118 miles (190 km) and Kentucky 79 miles (127 km)."
21666,47,west_virginia,21666,"West Virginia is entirely located in the Appalachian region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving rise to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi (""The mounttains are always free"")."
21667,47,west_virginia,21667,Altitude and robustness fall near large rivers like the Ohio River or the Shenandoah River.
21668,47,west_virginia,21668, About 75% of the state is located in the Cumberland Plateau and the Allegheny Plateau regions.
21669,47,west_virginia,21669," Although the terrain is not high, the plateau is extremely rugged in most regions."
21670,47,west_virginia,21670,"The average altitude of West Virginia is about 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, the highest of all American states east of Mississippi."
21671,47,west_virginia,21671,"On the eastern line of the state with Virginia, high peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region give rise to an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those in northern New England and eastern Canada."
21672,47,west_virginia,21672,"The highest point in the state is the summit of Spruce Knob at 1,482 m (1,863 feet) and is covered in dense spruce boreal forest at altitudes above 1,200 m (1,000 feet)."
21673,47,west_virginia,21673, Spruce Knob is located in Monongahela National Forest and is part of Spruce Knob-Senatorca Rocks National Recreational Area.
21674,47,west_virginia,21674,A total of six wild areas are also in the forest.
21675,47,west_virginia,21675," Outside the forest to the south, the New River Gorge is a 300 m deep canyon carved by the New River."
21676,47,west_virginia,21676,The National Parks Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as New River Gorge National Park and Reserve.
21677,47,west_virginia,21677, Other areas that are protected and managed include:
21678,47,west_virginia,21678," Most of West Virginia lies in the mixed ecoregion of the Appalachian Mesophyte forests, while the high elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie in the Appalachian and Blue Ridge forests."
21679,47,west_virginia,21679,"The native vegetation of most of the State was originally a mixed forest of hardwood oak, chestnut, maple, beech and white pine, with American willow and sycamore along the state's waterways."
21680,47,west_virginia,21680," Many of these areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact appreciated by native Virginians, who refer to their home as almost paradise (from John Denver's song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"")."
21681,47,west_virginia,21681," Before the song, he was known as ""The Cog State"" (coal, oil and gas) or ""The Mountain State""."
21682,47,west_virginia,21682,"The underlying rock strata are sandstone, shale, bituminous coal deposits, and limestone placed in an environment close to the coast from sediments from the mountains to the east in a shallow inland sea to the west."
21683,47,west_virginia,21683," Some beds illustrate a coastal marshy environment, a river delta, some shallow waters."
21684,47,west_virginia,21684,"Sea levels rose and fell several times during the Mississippi and Pennsylvania eras, giving a variety of rocky strata."
21685,47,west_virginia,21685,"The Appalachians are some of the oldest in the world, having formed more than three hundred million years ago."
21686,47,west_virginia,21686,"West Virginia's climate is generally a humid subtropical climate (climate classification of Köppen Cfa, except Dfb at higher altitudes) with warm to warm, humid and cold winters, increasing in severity with altitude."
21687,47,west_virginia,21687, Some regions of the southern highlands also have a temperate mountain climate (Köppen Cfb) where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are slightly cooler.
21688,47,west_virginia,21688," However, time is subject to change in all parts of the state."
21689,47,west_virginia,21689,Hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the Central Appalachian Mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest elevations.
21690,47,west_virginia,21690,"In the Eastern Panhandle and Ohio Valley, temperatures are warm enough to see and cultivate subtropical plants such as southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), bluertle crepe, Albizia julibrisin, American sweetgum and even needle palm and occasional minor sabal."
21691,47,west_virginia,21691, These plants do not thrive as well in other areas of the state.

21698,47,west_virginia,21698,The eastern valleys are less rainy because the ridges of the Allegheny Mountains to the west create a partial rain shadow.
21699,47,west_virginia,21699, Just over half of the rainfall occurs from April to September.
21700,47,west_virginia,21700,"Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the Kanawha section, especially in the Tygart Valley."

21702,47,west_virginia,21702,"In addition to the persistent cloudy sky caused by the degradation of moisture by the Alleghenies, West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation, with an average snowshoeing of nearly 200 days a year with rain or snow."
21703,47,west_virginia,21703,"Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower parts, but may persist for weeks in the upper mountainous regions."
21704,47,west_virginia,21704,"On average, 34 inches (860 mm) of snow fall each year in Charleston, although in the winter of 1995-96, more than three times this amount declined, with several cities in the state setting new snowfall records."

22431,49,wyoming,22431," Most of them are administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service in many national forests and a national prairie, not to mention large areas of ""public"" land and an air base near Cheyenne."
22432,49,wyoming,22432, There are also areas managed by the National Park Service and agencies such as the United States
22433,49,wyoming,22433, Wildlife and Fishing Service.

22445,49,wyoming,22445,"The territory was named after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, made famous by the poem Gertrude of Wyoming of 1809 by Thomas Campbell, based on the Battle of Wyoming in the American Revolution War."

22450,49,wyoming,22450,"In addition, copper has been mined in some areas between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the snow chain near Grand Encampment."

22452,49,wyoming,22452," This led to the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, which became the first national park in the world in 1872."

22454,49,wyoming,22454,"On December 10, 1869, Governor of the Territory John Allen Campbell extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and, later, the State of the United States, granting women the right to vote."

22463,49,wyoming,22463,The adoption of the Federal Homestead Act has led to an influx of small livestock farmers.
22464,49,wyoming,22464,A war of scope broke out when either or both of the groups chose a violent conflict over commercial competition in public land use.

22470,49,wyoming,22470,"In 2015, Wyoming had an estimated population of 586,107, an increase of 1,954, or 0.29%, over the previous year and 22,481, or 3.99%, since the 2010 census."
22471,49,wyoming,22471," This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase from the net migration of 4,035 people to the State."
22472,49,wyoming,22472,"Immigration has resulted in a net increase of 2,264 persons and internal migration has resulted in a net increase of 1,771 persons."

22474,49,wyoming,22474,"In 2005, the total number of births in Wyoming was 7,231 (birth rate of 14.04 per 1,000)."
22475,49,wyoming,22475,Wyoming is sparsely populated and is the least populated state of the United States.
22476,49,wyoming,22476,Wyoming has the second lowest population density in the country (behind Alaska) and is the sparsest of the 48 contiguous states.
22477,49,wyoming,22477,It is one of only two states (Vermont) with a population smaller than that of the national capital.
22478,49,wyoming,22478," According to the 2000 census, the largest ancestry groups in Wyoming are German (26.0%), English (16.0%), Irish (13.3%), Norwegian (4.3%), and Swedish (3.5%)."
22479,49,wyoming,22479,"Note: The births in the table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnic origin and race, giving a higher overall number."
22480,49,wyoming,22480,"The Constitution of Wyoming established three powers: executive, legislative and judicial."
22481,49,wyoming,22481,The State Legislative Assembly is composed of a 60-member House of Representatives and a 30-member Senator.
22482,49,wyoming,22482,"The executive branch is headed by the Governor and includes a Secretary of State, an auditor, a treasurer and a Superintendent of Public Education."
22483,49,wyoming,22483,Wyoming doesn't have a Lieutenant Governor.
22484,49,wyoming,22484,The Secretary of State is first and foremost in the line of succession.
22485,49,wyoming,22485,The small population of Wyoming earned him only one seat in the House of Representatives of the United States and thus only three votes in the electoral college.
22486,49,wyoming,22486,"The Wyoming State Liquor Association is the only legal wholesale distributor of government spirits, making it a state of control for alcoholic beverages."

22488,49,wyoming,22488,"Wyoming's highest court is the Supreme Court of Wyoming, with five judges presiding over appeals from the lower courts of the state."
22489,49,wyoming,22489,"Wyoming is unusual as it does not have an intermediate court of appeal, like most states."
22490,49,wyoming,22490, This is largely due to the population of the State and the decrease in the corresponding workload.
22491,49,wyoming,22491, Appeals from State District Courts are brought directly before the Wyoming Supreme Court.
22492,49,wyoming,22492,"Wyoming also has state district courts (formerly county courts) with limited jurisdiction, which deal with certain types of cases, such as lower-value civil claims, criminal offences and criminal prosecution."
22493,49,wyoming,22493,The judges of the travelling courts also hear low-value cases on a regular basis.
22494,49,wyoming,22494," Before 1972, Wyoming judges were chosen by popular vote on a non-partisan vote."
22495,49,wyoming,22495," This earlier system was criticized by the State Bar, which requested the adoption of the Missouri Plan, a system designed to balance the independence of the judiciary with judicial responsibility."
22496,49,wyoming,22496,"In 1972, an amendment to article 5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which included an amended version of the plan, was adopted by voters."

22498,49,wyoming,22498, They shall then be subject to a retention vote by the electorate one year after their appointment.
22499,49,wyoming,22499,Wyoming's political history challenges an easy classification.
22500,49,wyoming,22500,The State had been the first to grant women the right to vote and to elect a woman governor.
22501,49,wyoming,22501,"On December 10, 1869, John Allen Campbell, First Governor of Wyoming Territory, approved the first law in U.S. history explicitly granting women the right to vote."
22502,49,wyoming,22502, That day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day.
22503,49,wyoming,22503,"On 5 November 1889, voters approved the first constitution in the world which grants women the right to vote in their own right."
22504,49,wyoming,22504," While the state elected prominent democrats to the federal office in the 1960s and 1970s, politics became resolutely more conservative since the 1980s, when the Republican Party came to dominate the delegation of the State Congress."
22505,49,wyoming,22505," Today Wyoming is represented in Washington by his two senators, John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and his only member of the House of Representatives, Liz Cheney, MP."
