114,0,alabama,114,"Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools."
115,0,alabama,115,"In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs."
116,0,alabama,116,The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest.
117,0,alabama,117,"Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas."

122,0,alabama,122,"Continued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South."
123,0,alabama,123,"Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see ""historical populations"" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920."
124,0,alabama,124,"At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs."
125,0,alabama,125,"Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the ""Magic City""."
126,0,alabama,126,"By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States."
127,0,alabama,127,Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy.
128,0,alabama,128,"Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution."
129,0,alabama,129,This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.
130,0,alabama,130,Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.
131,0,alabama,131,Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living.
132,0,alabama,132,One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile.

134,0,alabama,134,Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.
135,0,alabama,135,"Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senatorte seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses."
136,0,alabama,136,They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
137,0,alabama,137,"One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature.
139,0,alabama,139,"A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, ""a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."""
140,0,alabama,140,"In the United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the court ruled that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures, and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142,"This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years."
143,0,alabama,143,Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144,"African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply."
146,0,alabama,146,"During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation."
147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery bus boycott (1955–56), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches."
148,0,alabama,148,These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the US Congress.
149,0,alabama,149,"Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court."
150,0,alabama,150,"According to The New York Times, by 2017, many of Alabama's African-Americans were living in Alabama's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery."
151,0,alabama,151,"Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama ""is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American."
152,0,alabama,152,"These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155,"At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats."
156,0,alabama,156,"Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158,This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County."
160,0,alabama,160,"In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County."
161,0,alabama,161,"Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens."
162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States."
163,0,alabama,163,About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

176,0,alabama,176,"A 1,000-foot (300 m)-wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago."
177,0,alabama,177,"The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (""star-wound"") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface."

351,0,alabama,351,Most counties do not have home rule.
352,0,alabama,352,"Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353,One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
354,0,alabama,354,Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches.
355,0,alabama,355,"The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senatorte, with 35 members."
356,0,alabama,356,"The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature.
358,0,alabama,358,The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).
359,0,alabama,359,"Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360,"It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,"It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either."
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one vote"", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.)"
363,0,alabama,363,"Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365,This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding."
367,0,alabama,367,"Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is headed by the governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370,"Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama."
371,0,alabama,371,The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey.
372,0,alabama,372,The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections.
373,0,alabama,373,"Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January."
374,0,alabama,374,The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state's Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases.
375,0,alabama,375,The state's highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama.
376,0,alabama,376,Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.
377,0,alabama,377,Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.
378,0,alabama,378,The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380,"There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts."
381,0,alabama,381,Some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions.
382,0,alabama,382,Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384,"However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385,Some of its cases have been highly controversial
386,0,alabama,386,It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence
387,0,alabama,387,This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,Taxes are collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue.
389,0,alabama,389,"Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending on the amount earned and filing status."
390,0,alabama,390,"Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if taking the standard deduction; those who itemize can also deduct FICA (the Social Security and Medicare tax)."
391,0,alabama,391,The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392,Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"As of 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the US Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.
399,0,alabama,399,The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400,"The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Property taxes are the lowest in the US
402,0,alabama,402,The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.
403,0,alabama,403,"Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405,Alabama has 67 counties.
406,0,alabama,406,"Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission."
407,0,alabama,407,It also has limited executive authority in the county.
408,0,alabama,408,"Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule."
409,0,alabama,409,"Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission."
411,0,alabama,411,Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county.
412,0,alabama,412,"United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of ""one man, one vote""."
413,0,alabama,413,"Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution."
416,0,alabama,416,"Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city."
417,0,alabama,417,"A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance."""
418,0,alabama,418,"Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol."
419,0,alabama,419,The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state.
420,0,alabama,420,"A total of 25 of the 67 counties are ""dry counties"" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales."
421,0,alabama,421,"During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope."
422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423,"After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution."
424,0,alabama,424,Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law."
427,0,alabama,427,"From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas."
428,0,alabama,428,"As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation."
429,0,alabama,429,"Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."
430,0,alabama,430,"Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation."
431,0,alabama,431,"Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections."
433,0,alabama,433,Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.
434,0,alabama,434,"In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing ""profound regret"" over slavery and its lingering impact."
435,0,alabama,435,"In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America."
436,0,alabama,436,"In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years."
437,0,alabama,437,"As of December 2017, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state."
438,0,alabama,438,"With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the ""Solid South"", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state."
439,0,alabama,439,"For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election."
440,0,alabama,440,"Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party."
441,0,alabama,441,"In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office."
442,0,alabama,442,Members of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office.
443,0,alabama,443,"Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats."
444,0,alabama,444,"In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper Sr. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court."
445,0,alabama,445,The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.
446,0,alabama,446,"In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices."
447,0,alabama,447,Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education.
448,0,alabama,448,"In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years."
449,0,alabama,449,"The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012."
450,0,alabama,450,"Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise."
451,0,alabama,451,"The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom (1999–2003), Kay Ivey (2011–2017), and Will Ainsworth (2019–present)."
452,0,alabama,452,"Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.)"
453,0,alabama,453,in the state are still held by Democrats.
454,0,alabama,454,"Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary."
455,0,alabama,455,"Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions."
456,0,alabama,456,"Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts."
457,0,alabama,457,"The current split is 35 Democrats, 31 Republicans, and one Independent Fayette."
458,0,alabama,458,"However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties."

529,1,alaska,529,"The Russians were the first Europeans to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state."
530,1,alaska,530,"The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the US in 1867 for US$7.2 million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km2)."
531,1,alaska,531,"The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11, 1912."
532,1,alaska,532,"It was admitted as the 49th state of the US on January 3, 1959."
533,1,alaska,533,"While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest, owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance."
534,1,alaska,534,"United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, parks, and wildlife refuges."
535,1,alaska,535,"Alaska's indigenous population is proportionally the highest of any US state, at over 15 percent."
536,1,alaska,536,"Close to two dozen native languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics."
537,1,alaska,537,"The name ""Alaska"" (Russian: Аля́ска, tr."
538,1,alaska,538,Alyáska) was introduced in the Russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the Alaska Peninsula.
539,1,alaska,539,"It was derived from an Aleut-language idiom, which figuratively refers to the mainland."
540,1,alaska,540,"Literally, it means object to which the action of the sea is directed."
541,1,alaska,541,Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States and has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the Aleutian Islands extend into the Eastern Hemisphere.
542,1,alaska,542,Alaska is the only non-contiguous US state on continental North America
543,1,alaska,543,"It is technically part of the continental US, but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the contiguous US, often called ""the Lower 48""."
544,1,alaska,544,"The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system."
545,1,alaska,545,"The state is bordered by Canada's Yukon and British Columbia to the east (making it the only state to border a Canadian territory), the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest, the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west and the Arctic Ocean to the north."
546,1,alaska,546,"Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian Big Diomede Island and Alaskan Little Diomede Island are only 3 miles (4.8 km) apart."
547,1,alaska,547,Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other US states combined.
548,1,alaska,548,"At 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2) in area, Alaska is by far the largest state in the United States, and is more than twice the size of the second-largest US state, Texas."
549,1,alaska,549,"Alaska is the seventh largest sub-national division in the world, and if it was an independent nation would be the 19th largest country in the world."
550,1,alaska,550,"There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions:"
551,1,alaska,551,"The most populous region of Alaska, containing Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and the Kenai Peninsula."
552,1,alaska,552,"Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the Alaska Range and west of the Wrangell Mountains also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the Prince William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez."
553,1,alaska,553,"Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States."
554,1,alaska,554,"As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase."
555,1,alaska,555,"The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States."
556,1,alaska,556,"It contains the state capital Juneau, the former capital Sitka, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska's largest city."
557,1,alaska,557,"The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system."
558,1,alaska,558,The Interior is the largest region of Alaska
559,1,alaska,559,Fairbanks is the only large city in the region.
560,1,alaska,560,Denali National Park and Preserve is located here.
561,1,alaska,561,"Denali, formerly Mount McKinley, is the highest mountain in North America."
562,1,alaska,562,Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 miles (800 km) inland from the Bering Sea.
563,1,alaska,563,Most of the population lives along the coast.
564,1,alaska,564,Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest.
565,1,alaska,565,"The massive Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here."
566,1,alaska,566,"Portions of the Alaska Peninsula are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below)."
567,1,alaska,567,The North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages.

569,1,alaska,569,"The city of Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow, is the northernmost city in the United States and is located here."
570,1,alaska,570,"The Northwest Arctic area, anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley, is often regarded as being part of this region."
571,1,alaska,571,"However, the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people."
572,1,alaska,572,"More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches more than 1,200 miles (1,900 km) into the Pacific Ocean."
573,1,alaska,573,"Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the International Date Line was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day."
574,1,alaska,574,"Two of the islands, Attu and Kiska, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II."
575,1,alaska,575,"With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (55,000 km) of tidal shoreline."
576,1,alaska,576,The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula.
577,1,alaska,577,Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions.
578,1,alaska,578,"Unimak Island, for example, is home to Mount Shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above the North Pacific."
579,1,alaska,579,"It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's Mount Fuji."
580,1,alaska,580,"The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland."

585,1,alaska,585,"Glacier ice covers about 28,957 square miles (75,000 km2) of Alaska."
586,1,alaska,586,"The Bering Glacier is the largest glacier in North America, covering 2,008 square miles (5,200 km2) alone."
587,1,alaska,587,"According to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the US federal government as public lands, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges."
588,1,alaska,588,"Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 million acres (35 million hectares), or 23.8% of the state."
589,1,alaska,589,The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
590,1,alaska,590,"It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising 16 million acres (6.5 million hectares)."
591,1,alaska,591,"Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns 101 million acres (41 million hectares), its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act."
592,1,alaska,592,"A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs."
593,1,alaska,593,Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities.
594,1,alaska,594,These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.
595,1,alaska,595,"The University of Alaska, as a land grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently."
596,1,alaska,596,"Another 44 million acres (18 million hectares) are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971."
597,1,alaska,597,"Regional Native corporation Doyon, Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications."
598,1,alaska,598,Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect.
599,1,alaska,599,"Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land."
600,1,alaska,600,"Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market, however."
601,1,alaska,601,"Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state."
602,1,alaska,602,"Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded."
603,1,alaska,603,The climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen Cfc) in the northern parts.
604,1,alaska,604,"On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year."
605,1,alaska,605,"Juneau averages over 50 in (130 cm) of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150 in (380 cm)."
606,1,alaska,606,This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.
607,1,alaska,607,The climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast.
608,1,alaska,608,"While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer."
609,1,alaska,609,"On average, Anchorage receives 16 in (41 cm) of precipitation a year, with around 75 in (190 cm) of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow."
610,1,alaska,610,"It is a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc) due to its brief, cool summers."
611,1,alaska,611,The climate of Western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.
612,1,alaska,612,It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north.
613,1,alaska,613,The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is.
614,1,alaska,614,This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation.
615,1,alaska,615,"An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley (i. e., the region around Kotzebue Sound) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10 in (25 cm) of precipitation annually."
616,1,alaska,616,"On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100 in (250 cm) of precipitation."
617,1,alaska,617,The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic.
618,1,alaska,618,Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks.
619,1,alaska,619,"The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below −60 °F (−51 °C)."
620,1,alaska,620,"Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than 10 in (25 cm) a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter."
621,1,alaska,621,The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior.
622,1,alaska,622,"The highest is 100 °F (38 °C) in Fort Yukon (which is just 8 mi or 13 km inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915, making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States."
623,1,alaska,623,"The lowest official Alaska temperature is −80 °F (−62 °C) in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971, one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada)."
624,1,alaska,624,"The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is Arctic (Köppen: ET) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers."
625,1,alaska,625,"Even in July, the average low temperature in Utqiagvik is 34 °F (1 °C)."
626,1,alaska,626,"Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than 10 in (25 cm) per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year."
627,1,alaska,627,Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area.
628,1,alaska,628,Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.
629,1,alaska,629,"At the Upward Sun River site in the Tanana River Valley in Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found."
630,1,alaska,630,The baby's DNA showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the New World at the end of the Pleistocene.
631,1,alaska,631,"Ben Potter, the University of Alaska Fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the Upward River Sun site in 2013, named this new group Ancient Beringians."
632,1,alaska,632,"The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon."
633,1,alaska,633,"Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts."
634,1,alaska,634,"The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the US Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla."
635,1,alaska,635,"All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption."
636,1,alaska,636,"The Aleutian Islands are still home to the Aleut people's seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by the Russians."
637,1,alaska,637,"Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the Yup'ik, while their cousins the Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska."
638,1,alaska,638,The Gwich'in people of the northern Interior region are Athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
639,1,alaska,639,The North Slope and Little Diomede Island are occupied by the widespread Inupiat people.
640,1,alaska,640,Some researchers believe the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.
641,1,alaska,641,"According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov's expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement."
642,1,alaska,642,"This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin, who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River, populated by ""bearded men"" who ""pray to the icons""."
643,1,alaska,643,Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with Koyuk River.
644,1,alaska,644,"The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the St. Gabriel under the authority of the surveyor M. S. Gvozdev and assistant navigator I. Fyodorov on August 21, 1732, during an expedition of Siberian cossack A. F. Shestakov and Russian explorer Dmitry Pavlutsky (1729–1735)."
645,1,alaska,645,"Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St. Peter."
646,1,alaska,646,"After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands."
647,1,alaska,647,The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.
648,1,alaska,648,"Between 1774 and 1800, Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest."
649,1,alaska,649,In 1789 a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound.
650,1,alaska,650,"These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez, Bucareli Sound, and Cordova."
651,1,alaska,651,"Later, the Russian-American Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century."
652,1,alaska,652,"Sitka, renamed New Archangel from 1804 to 1867, on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska, became the capital of Russian America."
653,1,alaska,653,It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States.
654,1,alaska,654,"The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable."
655,1,alaska,655,Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.
656,1,alaska,656,"William H. Seward, the United States Secretary of State, negotiated the Alaska Purchase (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million."
657,1,alaska,657,"Russia's contemporary ruler Tsar Alexander II, the Emperor of the Russian Empire, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland, also planned the sale; the purchase was made on March 30, 1867."
658,1,alaska,658,"Six months later the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged; the formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867."
659,1,alaska,659,"In the ceremony 250 uniformed US soldiers marched to the governor's house at ""Castle Hill"", where the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the US flag was raised."
660,1,alaska,660,"This event is celebrated as Alaska Day, a legal holiday on October 18."
661,1,alaska,661,"Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a district starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the President of the United States."
662,1,alaska,662,A federal district court was headquartered in Sitka.
663,1,alaska,663,"For most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers."
664,1,alaska,664,"They organized a ""provisional city government"", which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense."
665,1,alaska,665,"Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959."
666,1,alaska,666,"Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska."
667,1,alaska,667,Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912.
668,1,alaska,668,"Alaska's capital, which had been in Sitka until 1906, was moved north to Juneau."

671,1,alaska,671,"During World War II, the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on Attu, Agattu and Kiska, all which were occupied by the Empire of Japan."
672,1,alaska,672,"During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two United States Navy personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan."
673,1,alaska,673,About half of the Aleuts died during the period of internment.
674,1,alaska,674,"Unalaska/Dutch Harbor and Adak became significant bases for the United States Army, United States Army Air Forces and United States Navy."
675,1,alaska,675,"The United States Lend-Lease program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union."
676,1,alaska,676,The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.
677,1,alaska,677,Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate.
678,1,alaska,678,"Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946."
679,1,alaska,679,The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow.

685,1,alaska,685,"It was the second-most-powerful earthquake in recorded history, with a moment magnitude of 9.2 (more than a thousand times as powerful as the 1989 San Francisco earthquake)."
686,1,alaska,686,"The time of day (5:36 pm), time of year (spring) and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage."
687,1,alaska,687,The 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System led to an oil boom.
688,1,alaska,688,Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward.
689,1,alaska,689,"That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax."
690,1,alaska,690,"In 1989, the Exxon Valdez hit a reef in the Prince William Sound, spilling more than 11 million US gallons (42 megaliters) of crude oil over 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of coastline."

712,1,alaska,712,"A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 20 indigenous languages, known locally as ""native languages""."
713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages to have official status."
714,1,alaska,714,"This bill gave them symbolic recognition as official languages, though they have not been adopted for official use within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages that were included in the bill are:
716,1,alaska,716,"According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people identified as Evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholic, and 32,550 as mainline Protestants."
718,1,alaska,718,"Roughly 4% are Mormon, 0.5% are Jewish, 1% are Muslim, 0.5% are Buddhist, 0.2% are Baháʼí, and 0.5% are Hindu."
719,1,alaska,719,"The largest religious denominations in Alaska as of 2010 were the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 38,070 adherents, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 32,170 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents."
720,1,alaska,720,"Alaska has been identified, along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon, as being the least religious states of the USA, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,"In 1795, the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak."
722,1,alaska,722,Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724,Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems)."
726,1,alaska,726,"Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, Alaskan Hindus established the Sri Ganesha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu Temple in Alaska and the northernmost Hindu Temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728,"There are an estimated 2,000–3,000 Hindus in Alaska."
729,1,alaska,729,The vast majority of Hindus live in Anchorage or Fairbanks.
730,1,alaska,730,"Estimates for the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000."
731,1,alaska,731,The Islamic Community Center of Anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in Anchorage.
732,1,alaska,732,They broke ground on a building in south Anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014.
733,1,alaska,733,"When completed, the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world."
734,1,alaska,734,There's also a Baháʼí Center.
735,1,alaska,735,"The 2018 gross state product was $55 billion, 48th in the nation."
736,1,alaska,736,"Its per capita personal income for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation."
737,1,alaska,737,"According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent."
738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction."
739,1,alaska,739,"Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy.
741,1,alaska,741,"Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742,"Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere."
743,1,alaska,743,"Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744,"Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746,"Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747,There is also a growing service and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748,Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.
749,1,alaska,749,"Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted."
750,1,alaska,750,"Major oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California."
751,1,alaska,751,"Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although by early 2014 North Dakota's Bakken Formation was producing over 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752,"Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous Athabasca oil sands field, which by 2014 was producing about 1,500,000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"The Trans-Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope."
756,1,alaska,756,Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers.
757,1,alaska,757,Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.
758,1,alaska,758,"Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light."
759,1,alaska,759,"Although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g."
760,1,alaska,760,"with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once."
764,1,alaska,764,It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765,"It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768,"From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769,Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska.
770,1,alaska,770,"This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum."
771,1,alaska,771,"Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772,"Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences, and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a ""Basic income"" policy in the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal government employees, particularly United States Postal Service (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778,"Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779,"Most farms are in either the Matanuska Valley, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 60 miles (97 km) southwest of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons."
781,1,alaska,781,"The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus, especially the Delta Junction area, about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783,This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784,Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and community-supported agriculture."
786,1,alaska,786,"Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners, small farms and farmers' markets in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788,"Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789,"However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the Alaska State Fair in Palmer the largest), are held mostly in the late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792,"Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific."
793,1,alaska,793,Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it.
794,1,alaska,794,"Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport."
795,1,alaska,795,"This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Hunting for subsistence, primarily caribou, moose, and Dall sheep is still common in the state, particularly in remote Bush communities."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798,"Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799,"Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from ""Outside"", and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive."
801,1,alaska,801,"Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering a 1 US gallon (3.8 L) of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805,Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the US
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.
809,1,alaska,809,The Interstate Highways in Alaska consists of a total of 1082 miles.
810,1,alaska,810,"One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an active Alaska Railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of Whittier on Prince William Sound to the Seward Highway about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Anchorage at Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 2.5 miles (4.0 km), the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812,The tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in North America.
813,1,alaska,813,"Built around 1915, the Alaska Railroad (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from Seward to Interior Alaska by way of South Central Alaska, passing through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali, and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815,"The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as ""The Railbelt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country.
821,1,alaska,821,A stretch of about 60 miles (100 km) of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road
822,1,alaska,822,"Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northern Southeast Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Route also partly runs through the state from Skagway northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824,"This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was featured in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways.
826,1,alaska,826,The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the Canadian National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles to the southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the US Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48."
829,1,alaska,829,Some private companies provides car float service between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830,"Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea."
831,1,alaska,831,"Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832,The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada through the Inside Passage to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast."
836,1,alaska,836,The population of Ketchikan for example fluctuates dramatically on many days—up to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time.
837,1,alaska,837,"Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed bush air services—an Alaskan novelty."
838,1,alaska,838,"Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by many major airlines."
839,1,alaska,839,"Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska received almost two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841,"Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program."
842,1,alaska,842,"Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities."
843,1,alaska,843,"The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845,Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities.
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.
847,1,alaska,847,Many communities have small air taxi services.
848,1,alaska,848,These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849,Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any US state.
852,1,alaska,852,Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by all-terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as it is commonly referred to in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859,Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has ""two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska."
861,1,alaska,861,"In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government."
862,1,alaska,862,"Like all other US states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive branch consisting of the governor of Alaska and his or her appointees which head executive departments; a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senatorte; and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts."
863,1,alaska,863,"The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide."
864,1,alaska,864,The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senatorte.
865,1,alaska,865,Senatortors serve four-year terms and House members two.
866,1,alaska,866,The governor of Alaska serves four-year terms.
867,1,alaska,867,"The lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries, but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket."
868,1,alaska,868,"Alaska's court system has four levels: the Alaska Supreme Court, the Alaska Court of Appeals, the superior courts and the district courts."
869,1,alaska,869,The superior and district courts are trial courts.
870,1,alaska,870,"Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts hear only certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000."
871,1,alaska,871,The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are appellate courts.
872,1,alaska,872,"The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and habeas corpus."
873,1,alaska,873,The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.
874,1,alaska,874,"Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a Democratic state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as Republican-leaning."
875,1,alaska,875,"Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights."
876,1,alaska,876,"Alaska Natives, while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the Native corporations."
877,1,alaska,877,"These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship."
878,1,alaska,878,"Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force."
879,1,alaska,879,"The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the Alaskan Independence Party."
880,1,alaska,880,Six Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska.
881,1,alaska,881,"In addition, Republican governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected."
882,1,alaska,882,He officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.
883,1,alaska,883,"Alaska's voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on February 24, 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington as the first three US states where recreational marijuana is legal."
884,1,alaska,884,The new law means people over 21 can consume small amounts of pot.
885,1,alaska,885,The first legal marijuana store opened in Valdez in October 2016.
886,1,alaska,886,"To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies."
887,1,alaska,887,This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.
888,1,alaska,888,"It is one of five states with no sales tax, one of seven states with no individual income tax, and—along with New Hampshire—one of two that has neither."
889,1,alaska,889,The Department of Revenue Tax Division reports regularly on the state's revenue sources.
890,1,alaska,890,"The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division."
891,1,alaska,891,"In 2014 the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having the fourth most ""business friendly"" tax policy, behind only Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nevada."
892,1,alaska,892,"While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0 to 7.5%, typically 3–5%."

2449,5,colorado,2449,"Major parts of the economy include government and defense, mining, agriculture, tourism, and increasingly other kinds of manufacturing."
2450,5,colorado,2450,"With increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability, Colorado's agriculture, forestry and tourism economies are expected to be heavily affected by climate change."
2451,5,colorado,2451,"Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, which includes alpine mountains, high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons."
2452,5,colorado,2452,"In 1861, the United States Congress defined the boundaries of the new Territory of Colorado exclusively by lines of latitude and longitude, stretching from 37°N to 41°N latitude, and from 102°02′48″W to 109°02′48″W longitude (25°W to 32°W from the Washington Meridian)."

2459,5,colorado,2459,"This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the Mississippi River or the Rio Grande into the Gulf of Mexico."
2460,5,colorado,2460,"The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 true peaks with a total of 58 that are 14,000 feet (4,267 m) or higher in elevation above sea level, known as fourteeners."
2461,5,colorado,2461,"These mountains are largely covered with trees such as conifers and aspens up to the tree line, at an elevation of about 12,000 feet (3,658 m) in southern Colorado to about 10,500 feet (3,200 m) in northern Colorado."
2462,5,colorado,2462,Above this tree line only alpine vegetation grows.
2463,5,colorado,2463,Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year-round.

2499,5,colorado,2499,Across the Sangre de Cristo Range to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the Wet Mountain Valley.
2500,5,colorado,2500,"These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the Rio Grande Rift, a major geological formation of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches."
2501,5,colorado,2501,The Western Slope area of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the state to the western border.
2502,5,colorado,2502,This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts.
2503,5,colorado,2503,The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west of the mountains.
2504,5,colorado,2504,It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.
2505,5,colorado,2505,"From west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the Great Plains."
2506,5,colorado,2506,The famous Pikes Peak is located just west of Colorado Springs.
2507,5,colorado,2507,"Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south."
2508,5,colorado,2508,"The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted Dinosaur National Monument, which not only is a paleontological area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds."
2509,5,colorado,2509,"Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado."

2511,5,colorado,2511,"The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the Gunnison River, Green River, and the San Juan River), or by evaporation in its arid areas."
2512,5,colorado,2512,"The Colorado River flows through Glenwood Canyon, and then through an arid valley made up of desert from Rifle to Parachute, through the desert canyon of De Beque Canyon, and into the arid desert of Grand Valley, where the city of Grand Junction is located."
2513,5,colorado,2513,"Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the Grand Mesa, which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the Colorado Plateau, a high arid region that borders Southern Utah."
2514,5,colorado,2514,"Grand Junction, Colorado is the largest city on the Western Slope."
2515,5,colorado,2515,"Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of television broadcasting west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers."

2522,5,colorado,2522,The climate of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the Mountain States region.
2523,5,colorado,2523,"Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado."
2524,5,colorado,2524,"Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains."
2528,5,colorado,2528,"Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in."
2529,5,colorado,2529,Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.
2530,5,colorado,2530,"The climate of the Eastern Plains is semiarid (Köppen climate classification: BSk) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from 15 to 25 inches (380 to 640 millimeters) annually."
2531,5,colorado,2531,"The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average diurnal temperature range."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced precipitation shadow as a result of being on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this area can have many days above 95 °F (35 °C) and often 100 °F (38 °C)."
2535,5,colorado,2535,"On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to −10 °F (−4 to −23 °C)."
2536,5,colorado,2536,"About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts."
2537,5,colorado,2537,"Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538,"Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,"In much of the region, March is the snowiest month."
2540,5,colorado,2540,"April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to Chinook winds which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70 °F (21 °C) or higher in the winter."
2542,5,colorado,2542,The average July temperature is 55 °F (13 °C) in the morning and 90 °F (32 °C) in the afternoon.
2543,5,colorado,2543,"The average January temperature is 18 °F (−8 °C) in the morning and 48 °F (9 °C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40 °F (20 °C)."
2544,5,colorado,2544,"Just west of the plains and into the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types."
2545,5,colorado,2545,Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546,"Most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an alpine climate at the highest elevations."
2547,5,colorado,2547,"Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (Cfb/Cwb), humid subtropical (Cfa), humid continental (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterranean (Csa/Csb) and subarctic (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548,"Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549,"Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern Plains, especially the northeast part of the state."
2551,5,colorado,2551,"Hail is the most commonly reported warm-season severe weather hazard, and occasionally causes human injuries, as well as significant property damage."
2552,5,colorado,2552,The eastern Plains are subject to some of the biggest hail storms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553,"Notable examples are the severe hailstorms that hit Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the costliest ever in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of Tornado Alley; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the 2008 Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern Plains see especially frequent tornadoes, both those spawned from mesocyclones in supercell thunderstorms and from less intense landspouts, such as within the Denver convergence vorticity zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,"The Plains are also susceptible to occasional floods and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather."
2557,5,colorado,2557,"Notable examples include the 1965 Denver Flood, the Big Thompson River flooding of 1976 and the 2013 Colorado floods."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common during summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above 90 °F (32 °C) was broken during the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561,"Much of Colorado is very dry, with the state averaging only 17 inches (430 millimeters) of precipitation per year statewide."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely experiences a time when some portion is not in some degree of drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563,"The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state, such as the Hayman Fire of 2002."
2564,5,colorado,2564,"Other notable fires include the Fourmile Canyon Fire of 2010, the Waldo Canyon Fire and High Park Fire of June 2012, and the Black Forest Fire of June 2013."
2565,5,colorado,2565,"Even these fires were exceeded in severity by the Pine Gulch Fire, Cameron Peak Fire and East Troublesome Fire in 2020, all being the three largest fires in Colorado history (see 2020 Colorado wildfires)."
2566,5,colorado,2566,"However, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls."
2567,5,colorado,2567,"The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the Yampa River, the Colorado River, the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the South Platte River."
2568,5,colorado,2568,"Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas."
2569,5,colorado,2569,"A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico."
2570,5,colorado,2570,"The highest official ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115 °F (46.1 °C) on July 20, 2019, at John Martin Dam."
2571,5,colorado,2571,"The lowest official air temperature was −61 °F (−51.7 °C) on February 1, 1985, at Maybell."
2572,5,colorado,2572,"Despite its mountainous terrain, Colorado is relatively quiet seismically."
2573,5,colorado,2573,The US National Earthquake Information Center is located in Golden.
2574,5,colorado,2574,"On August 22, 2011, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake occurred 9 miles (14 km) west-southwest of the city of Trinidad."
2575,5,colorado,2575,There were no casualties and only a small amount of damage was reported.
2576,5,colorado,2576,It was the second-largest earthquake in Colorado's history.
2577,5,colorado,2577,A magnitude 5.7 earthquake was recorded in 1973.

2587,5,colorado,2587,The Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to US involvement in the region.
2588,5,colorado,2588,The US acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803.
2589,5,colorado,2589,This US claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper Arkansas River Basin as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of Santa Fé de Nuevo México.
2590,5,colorado,2590,"In 1806, Zebulon Pike led a US Army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region."
2591,5,colorado,2591,"Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the San Luis Valley the following February, taken to Chihuahua, and expelled from Mexico the following July."
2592,5,colorado,2592,The US relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the Arkansas River and south of 42nd parallel north and west of the 100th meridian west as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819.

2594,5,colorado,2594,"Having settled its border with Spain, the US admitted the southeastern portion of the Territory of Missouri to the Union as the state of Missouri on August 10, 1821."
2595,5,colorado,2595,"The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the question of slavery."
2596,5,colorado,2596,"After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the Treaty of Córdoba signed on August 24, 1821."
2597,5,colorado,2597,Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-Onís Treaty in 1831.
2598,5,colorado,2598,The Texian Revolt of 1835–36 fomented a dispute between the US and Mexico which eventually erupted into the Mexican–American War in 1846.
2599,5,colorado,2599,Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the US with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo at the conclusion of the war in 1848.
2600,5,colorado,2600,"Most American settlers traveling overland west to the Oregon Country, the new goldfields of California, or the new Mormon settlements of the State of Deseret in the Salt Lake Valley, avoided the rugged Southern Rocky Mountains, and instead followed the North Platte River and Sweetwater River to South Pass (Wyoming), the lowest crossing of the Continental Divide between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains."
2601,5,colorado,2601,"In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal State of Deseret, claiming the entire Great Basin and all lands drained by the rivers Green, Grand, and Colorado."

3322,6,connecticut,3322,It may have originated in the early machined sheet tin nutmeg grinders sold by early Connecticut peddlers.

3334,7,delaware,3334,"Delaware ( (listen) DEL-ə-wair) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Maryland to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean to its east."
3335,7,delaware,3335,"The state takes its name from the nearby Delaware River named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor."
3336,7,delaware,3336,Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and some islands and territory within the Delaware River.
3337,7,delaware,3337,"It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated."
3338,7,delaware,3338,"Delaware's largest city is Wilmington, while the state capital is Dover, the second-largest city in the state."
3339,7,delaware,3339,"The state is divided into three counties, having the lowest number of any state; from north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County."
3340,7,delaware,3340,"While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle is more urbanized."
3341,7,delaware,3341,"In a similar vein to Maryland, Delaware's geography, culture, and history combine elements of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the country."
3342,7,delaware,3342,"Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south."
3343,7,delaware,3343,"It was initially colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near the present town of Lewes, in 1631."
3344,7,delaware,3344,Delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the American Revolution.
3345,7,delaware,3345,"On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, and has since been known as The First State."
3346,7,delaware,3346,"Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware is also a de facto onshore corporate haven, in which by virtue of its corporate laws, the state is the domicile of over 50% of all NYSE-listed business and 60% of the Fortune 500."
3347,7,delaware,3347,"The state was named after the Delaware River, which in turn derived its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577–1618) who was the ruling governor of the Colony of Virginia at the time Europeans first explored the river."
3348,7,delaware,3348,"The Delaware people, a name used by Europeans for Lenape people indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source."
3349,7,delaware,3349,The surname de La Warr comes from Sussex and is of Anglo-Norman origin.
3350,7,delaware,3350,It came probably from a Norman lieu-dit La Guerre.
3351,7,delaware,3351,"This toponymic could derive from Latin ager, from the Breton gwern or from the Late Latin varectum (fallow)."
3352,7,delaware,3352,"The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire (the sound [ä] often mutated in [æ]) also appear in old texts cited by Lucien Musset, where the word ga(i)ra means gore."
3353,7,delaware,3353,It could also be linked with a patronymic from the Old Norse verr.
3354,7,delaware,3354,"Delaware is 96 miles (154 km) long and ranges from 9 miles (14 km) to 35 miles (56 km) across, totaling 1,954 square miles (5,060 km2), making it the second-smallest state in the United States after Rhode Island."
3355,7,delaware,3355,"Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania; to the east by the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by Maryland."
3356,7,delaware,3356,Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey.
3357,7,delaware,3357,"The state of Delaware, together with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia, form the Delmarva Peninsula, which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast."
3358,7,delaware,3358,The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual.
3359,7,delaware,3359,Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending 12 miles (19.3 km) from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of New Castle.
3360,7,delaware,3360,This boundary is often referred to as the Twelve-Mile Circle.
3361,7,delaware,3361,"Although the Twelve-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the US that is a true arc, the Mexican boundary with Texas includes several arcs, and many cities in the South (such as Plains, Georgia) also have circular boundaries."
3362,7,delaware,3362,"This border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the 12-mile (19 km) arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River."
3363,7,delaware,3363,"To the west, a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of Maryland."
3364,7,delaware,3364,The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc.
3365,7,delaware,3365,"The Wedge of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed."
3366,7,delaware,3366,"Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation."
3367,7,delaware,3367,"Its highest elevation, located at Ebright Azimuth, near Concord High School, is less than 450 feet (140 m) above sea level."
3368,7,delaware,3368,The northernmost part of the state is part of the Piedmont Plateau with hills and rolling surfaces.
3369,7,delaware,3369,"The Atlantic Seaboard fall line approximately follows the Robert Kirkwood Highway between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road is the Atlantic Coastal Plain with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground."
3370,7,delaware,3370,A ridge about 75 to 80 feet (23 to 24 m) high extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the watersheds that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west.
3371,7,delaware,3371,"Since almost all of Delaware is a part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate."
3372,7,delaware,3372,The state lies in the humid subtropical climate zone.
3373,7,delaware,3373,"Despite its small size (roughly 100 miles (160 km) from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County."
3374,7,delaware,3374,"Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state."
3375,7,delaware,3375,"Delaware's all-time record high of 110 °F (43 °C) was recorded at Millsboro on July 21, 1930."
3376,7,delaware,3376,"The all-time record low of −17 °F (−27 °C) was also recorded at Millsboro, on January 17, 1893."
3377,7,delaware,3377,The hardiness zones are 7a and 7b.
3378,7,delaware,3378,The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation.
3379,7,delaware,3379,In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States.
3380,7,delaware,3380,In the southern two-thirds of the state are found Middle Atlantic coastal forests.
3381,7,delaware,3381,"Trap Pond State Park, along with areas in other parts of Sussex County, for example, support the northernmost stands of bald cypress trees in North America."
3382,7,delaware,3382,"Delaware provides government subsidy support for the clean-up of property ""lightly contaminated"" by hazardous waste, the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales."
3383,7,delaware,3383,"Before Delaware was settled by European colonists, the area was home to the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as the Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mostly along the coast, and the Nanticoke who occupied much of the southern Delmarva Peninsula."
3384,7,delaware,3384,"John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of the Nanticoke—they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the Chesapeake Bay."
3385,7,delaware,3385,The Kuskarawocks were most likely the Tuscarora.
3386,7,delaware,3386,The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River.
3387,7,delaware,3387,"They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock."
3388,7,delaware,3388,"With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the Alleghany Mountains by the mid-18th century."
3389,7,delaware,3389,"Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael, near the site of Lewes in 1631."
3391,7,delaware,3391,Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with area Native American tribes.
3392,7,delaware,3392,"In 1638 New Sweden, a Swedish trading post and colony, was established at Fort Christina (now in Wilmington) by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch."
3393,7,delaware,3393,The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years.
3394,7,delaware,3394,"In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at present-day New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch New Netherland."
3395,7,delaware,3395,"Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York."
3396,7,delaware,3396,"Fighting off a prior claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, Proprietor of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to William Penn in 1682."
3397,7,delaware,3397,"Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the ""Lower Counties on the Delaware"" from the Duke."
3398,7,delaware,3398,Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682.
3399,7,delaware,3399,"However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at Philadelphia, and the other at New Castle."
3400,7,delaware,3400,Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties.
3401,7,delaware,3401,The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique.
3402,7,delaware,3402,From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.
3403,7,delaware,3403,Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.
3404,7,delaware,3404,"Dependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England."
3405,7,delaware,3405,"The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive."
3406,7,delaware,3406,"Like the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with Britain."
3407,7,delaware,3407,"The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies."
3408,7,delaware,3408,Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.
3409,7,delaware,3409,"So it was that New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and Kent County native John Dickinson became the ""Penman of the Revolution."""
3410,7,delaware,3410,"Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, Patriot leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776."
3411,7,delaware,3411,"The person best representing Delaware's majority, George Read, could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence."
3412,7,delaware,3412,Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.
3413,7,delaware,3413,"Initially led by John Haslet, Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the Continental Army, known as the ""Delaware Blues"" and nicknamed the ""Blue Hen's Chicks""."
3414,7,delaware,3414,In August 1777 General Sir William Howe led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the Battle of Brandywine and capture of the city of Philadelphia.
3415,7,delaware,3415,"The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the Battle of Cooch's Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777, at Cooch's Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a minor Loyalist rebellion in 1778."
3416,7,delaware,3416,"Following the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and State President John McKinly was taken prisoner."
3417,7,delaware,3417,"The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active Loyalist portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County."
3418,7,delaware,3418,"Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines."
3419,7,delaware,3419,"Following the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state."
3420,7,delaware,3420,"Many colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly."
3421,7,delaware,3421,The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves because of a decline in working class immigrants from England.
3422,7,delaware,3422,"Most of the English colonists had arrived as indentured servants (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid."
3423,7,delaware,3423,Most of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land.
3424,7,delaware,3424,"They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men."
3425,7,delaware,3425,"Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery."
3426,7,delaware,3426,"As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened."
3427,7,delaware,3427,"By the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline."
3428,7,delaware,3428,Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor.
3429,7,delaware,3429,"In addition local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons."
3430,7,delaware,3430,By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free.
3431,7,delaware,3431,"When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves."
3432,7,delaware,3432,"By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves."
3433,7,delaware,3433,"Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice."
3434,7,delaware,3434,"By the 1860 census on the verge of the Civil War, 91.7% of the black population were free; 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 ""free colored persons""."
3435,7,delaware,3435,"An independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave Peter Spencer as the ""Union Church of Africans""."
3436,7,delaware,3436,"This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the African Methodist Episcopal Church by Richard Allen, which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816."
3437,7,delaware,3437,Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.
3438,7,delaware,3438,"This was renamed as the African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection, more commonly known as the A.U.M.P."
3439,7,delaware,3439,Church.
3440,7,delaware,3440,"In 1814, Spencer called for the first annual gathering, known as the Big August Quarterly, which continues to draw members of this denomination and their descendants together in a religious and cultural festival."
3441,7,delaware,3441,"Delaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861, and so remained in the Union."
3442,7,delaware,3442,"While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments."
3443,7,delaware,3443,Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled.
3444,7,delaware,3444,"Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War but rejected the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869."
3445,7,delaware,3445,"Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901."
3446,7,delaware,3446,"The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Delaware was 973,764 on July 1, 2019, an 8.4% increase since the 2010 United States Census."
3447,7,delaware,3447,Delaware's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States.
3448,7,delaware,3448,"Generally, the rural Southern (or ""Slower Lower"") regions of Delaware below the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal embody a Southern culture, while densely-populated Northern Delaware above the canal—particularly Wilmington, a part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area—has more in common with that of the Northeast."
3449,7,delaware,3449,"The US Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the South Atlantic States, but it is commonly associated with the Mid-Atlantic States and/or Northeastern United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents."
3450,7,delaware,3450,"According to the 2010 United States Census, Delaware had a population of 897,934."
3451,7,delaware,3451,The racial composition of the state was:
3452,7,delaware,3452,"Ethnically, Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 8.2% of the population."
3453,7,delaware,3453,"Delaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile more than the national average, and ranking 45th in population."
3454,7,delaware,3454,"Delaware is one of five states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census."
3455,7,delaware,3455,"The center of population of Delaware is in New Castle County, in the town of Townsend."
3456,7,delaware,3456,"As of 2011, 49.7% of Delaware's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two parents of non-Hispanic white ancestry)."

3490,7,delaware,3490,The state's attractiveness as a corporate haven is largely because of its business-friendly corporation law.

3495,7,delaware,3495,"The transportation system in Delaware is under the governance and supervision of the Delaware Department of Transportation, also known as ""DelDOT""."
3496,7,delaware,3496,"Funding for DelDOT projects is drawn, in part, from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund, established in 1987 to help stabilize transportation funding; the availability of the Trust led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware state operations."
3497,7,delaware,3497,"DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware Adopt-a-Highway program, major road route snow removal, traffic control infrastructure (signs and signals), toll road management, Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles, the Delaware Transit Corporation (branded as ""DART First State"", the state government public transportation organization), among others."

3508,7,delaware,3508,"A bicycle route, Delaware Bicycle Route 1, spans the north–south length of the state from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island to the Pennsylvania border north of Montchanin."

3513,7,delaware,3513,It has been noted that the tar and chip composition of secondary roads in Sussex County makes them more prone to deterioration than are the asphalt roadways in almost the rest of the state.

3527,7,delaware,3527,"The DART First State public transportation system was named ""Most Outstanding Public Transportation System"" in 2003 by the American Public Transportation Association."
3528,7,delaware,3528,Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties.
3529,7,delaware,3529,"The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and paratransit modes."
3530,7,delaware,3530,"The paratransit system, consisting of a statewide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as ""the most generous paratransit system in the United States""."
3531,7,delaware,3531,"As of 2012, fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988."
3532,7,delaware,3532,"As of 2016, there is no scheduled air service from any Delaware airport, as has been the case in various years since 1991."
3533,7,delaware,3533,"Various airlines had served Wilmington Airport, the latest departure being Frontier Airlines in April 2015."
3534,7,delaware,3534,Delaware is centrally situated in the Northeast megalopolis region of cities along I-95.
3535,7,delaware,3535,"Therefore, Delaware commercial airline passengers most frequently use Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) for domestic and international transit."
3536,7,delaware,3536,"Residents of Sussex County will also use Wicomico Regional Airport (SBY), as it is located less than 10 miles (16 km) from the Delaware border."

3551,7,delaware,3551,"Significantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of Chancery in the nation, which has jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to mergers and acquisitions."
3552,7,delaware,3552,The Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers.
3553,7,delaware,3553,"In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law, which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs."
3554,7,delaware,3554,"For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are incorporated in Delaware, including 60% of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange."
3555,7,delaware,3555,"Delaware was the last US state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952."

3563,7,delaware,3563,"Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states—such as court and law enforcement—have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government."
3564,7,delaware,3564,"The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions."

3574,7,delaware,3574,"Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware including Senatorte and House."
3575,7,delaware,3575,"Delaware's swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's population (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle County's 535,000)."
3576,7,delaware,3576,New Castle County has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988.

3812,8,florida,3812,"On average, Florida is the flattest state in the United States."
3813,8,florida,3813,The climate of Florida is tempered somewhat by the fact that no part of the state is distant from the ocean.
3814,8,florida,3814,"North of Lake Okeechobee, the prevalent climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: Cfa), while areas south of the lake (including the Florida Keys) have a true tropical climate (Köppen: Aw, Am, and Af)."

3840,8,florida,3840,It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm.
3841,8,florida,3841,"In 1992, Florida was the site of what was then the costliest weather disaster in US history, Hurricane Andrew, which caused more than $25 billion in damages when it struck during August; it held that distinction until 2005, when Hurricane Katrina surpassed it, and it has since been surpassed by six other hurricanes."
3842,8,florida,3842,Andrew is currently the second costliest hurricane in Florida's history.

3861,8,florida,3861,The reef lies a little bit off of the coast of the Florida Keys.
3862,8,florida,3862,"A lot of the reef lies within John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which was the first underwater park in the United States."

4330,9,georgia,4330,Due to anthropogenic Climate change the climate of Georgia is warming.
4331,9,georgia,4331,"This is already causing major disruption, for example, from sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable to it than many other states because the its land is sinking) and further warming will increase it."
4332,9,georgia,4332,"The United States Census Bureau estimates that in 2019 Georgia had a population of 10,617,423, which was an increase of 97,948 from the previous year, and an increase of 929,770 (9.60%) since 2010."

4334,9,georgia,4334,"Immigration resulted in a net increase of 228,415 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 378,258 people."
4335,9,georgia,4335,"As of 2010, the number of illegal immigrants living in Georgia more than doubled to 480,000 from January 2000 to January 2009, according to a federal report."
4336,9,georgia,4336,That gave Georgia the greatest percentage increase among the 10 states with the biggest illegal immigrant populations during those years.
4337,9,georgia,4337,Georgia has banned sanctuary cities.
4338,9,georgia,4338,"There were 743,000 veterans in 2009."
4339,9,georgia,4339,"According to the 2010 United States Census, Georgia had a population of 9,687,653."
4340,9,georgia,4340,"In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 59.7% White (55.9% Non-Hispanic White alone), 30.5% Black or African American, 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 4.0% from some other race, and 2.1% from two or more races."
4341,9,georgia,4341,Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 8.8% of the population.
4342,9,georgia,4342,"As of 2011, 58.8% of Georgia's population younger than 1 were minorities (meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white) compared to other states like California with 75.1%, New York with 55.6%, and Texas with 69.8%."
4343,9,georgia,4343,The largest European ancestry groups are:
4344,9,georgia,4344,"In the 1980 census 1,584,303 Georgians claimed English ancestry out of a total state population of 3,994,817, making them 40% of the state, and the largest ethnic group at the time."
4345,9,georgia,4345,"Today, many of these same people claiming they are of ""American"" ancestry are actually of English descent, and some are of Scots-Irish descent; however, their families have lived in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify simply as having ""American"" ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346,"Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original thirteen colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim ""American"" ancestry, though they are of predominantly English ancestry."
4347,9,georgia,4347,"As of 2004, 7.7% of Georgia's population was reported as under 5 years of age, 26.4% under 18, and 9.6% were 65 or older."
4348,9,georgia,4348,"Also, as of 2004, females made up approximately 50.6% of the population and African Americans made up approximately 29.6%."
4349,9,georgia,4349,"Historically, about half of Georgia's population was composed of African Americans who, before the Civil War, were almost exclusively enslaved."
4350,9,georgia,4350,The Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African American population.
4351,9,georgia,4351,"Georgia had the second-fastest-growing Asian population growth in the US from 1990 to 2000, more than doubling in size during the ten-year period."
4352,9,georgia,4352,"In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percent of the total population that is African American (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and third in numeric Black population after New York and Florida."
4353,9,georgia,4353,"Georgia is the state with the third-lowest percentage of older people (65 or older), at 12.8 percent (as of 2015)."
4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonial settlement of large numbers of Scottish American, English American and Scotch-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmont, and coastal settlement by some English Americans and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported to coastal areas in the 18th century repeatedly from rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans.
4356,9,georgia,4356,"They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture were continued more than in some other areas."
4357,9,georgia,4357,"In the creolization of Southern culture, their foodways became an integral part of all Southern cooking in the Low Country."
4358,9,georgia,4358,"As of 2010, 87.35% (7,666,663) of Georgia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.42% (651,583) spoke Spanish, 0.51% (44,702) Korean, 0.44% (38,244) Vietnamese, 0.42% (36,679) French, 0.38% (33,009) Chinese (which includes Mandarin), and German, which was spoken as a main language by 0.29% (23,351) of the population over the age of 5."
4359,9,georgia,4359,"In total, 12.65% (1,109,888) of Georgia's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English."
4360,9,georgia,4360,"Atlanta, located in north-central Georgia at the Eastern Continental Divide, has been Georgia's capital city since 1868."
4361,9,georgia,4361,"It is the most populous city in Georgia, with an estimated 2019 population of just over 506,000."
4362,9,georgia,4362,"The Atlanta metropolitan area is the cultural and economic center of the Southeast; its estimated population in 2019 was over 6 million, or 57% of Georgia's total."
4363,9,georgia,4363,Atlanta is the nation's ninth largest metropolitan area.
4364,9,georgia,4364,"The state has seventeen cities with populations above 50,000, based on 2019 US Census estimates."
4365,9,georgia,4365,"Along with the rest of the Southeast, Georgia's population continues to grow rapidly, with primary gains concentrated in urban areas."
4366,9,georgia,4366,"The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area added 1.23 million people (24 percent) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta rose in rank from the eleventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States to the ninth-largest."
4367,9,georgia,4367,"The composition of religious affiliation in Georgia is 70% Protestant, 9% Catholic, 1% Mormon, 1% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu."
4368,9,georgia,4368,"Atheists, deists, agnostics, and other unaffiliated people make up 13% of the population."
4369,9,georgia,4369,"The largest Christian denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,759,317; the United Methodist Church with 619,394; and the Roman Catholic Church with 596,384."
4370,9,georgia,4370,"Non-denominational Evangelical Protestant had 566,782 members, the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) has 175,184 members, and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. has 172,982 members."
4371,9,georgia,4371,"The Presbyterian Church (USA) is the largest Presbyterian body in the state, with 300 congregations and 100,000 members."
4372,9,georgia,4372,"The other large body, Presbyterian Church in America, had at its founding date 14 congregations and 2,800 members; in 2010 it counted 139 congregations and 32,000 members."
4373,9,georgia,4373,"The Roman Catholic Church is noteworthy in Georgia's urban areas, and includes the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of Savannah."
4374,9,georgia,4374,"Georgia is home to the largest Hindu temple in the United States, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Atlanta, located in the suburb city of Lilburn."
4375,9,georgia,4375,"Georgia is home to several historic synagogues including The Temple (Atlanta), Congregation Beth Jacob (Atlanta), and Congregation Mickve Israel (Savannah)."
4376,9,georgia,4376,Chabad and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute are also active in the state.
4377,9,georgia,4377,"As with all other US states and the federal government, Georgia's government is based on the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial power."
4378,9,georgia,4378,"Executive authority in the state rests with the governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republican)."
4379,9,georgia,4379,Both the Governor of Georgia and lieutenant governor are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office.
4380,9,georgia,4380,"Unlike the federal government, but like many other US States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor."
4381,9,georgia,4381,"Legislative authority resides in the General Assembly, composed of the Senatorte and House of Representatives."
4382,9,georgia,4382,"The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senatorte, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker."
4383,9,georgia,4383,"The Georgia Constitution mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives."
4384,9,georgia,4384,The term of office for senators and representatives is two years.
4385,9,georgia,4385,The laws enacted by the General Assembly are codified in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
4386,9,georgia,4386,"State judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which have statewide authority."
4387,9,georgia,4387,"In addition, there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction, including Superior Courts, State Courts, Juvenile Courts, Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts."
4388,9,georgia,4388,Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms.
4389,9,georgia,4389,Judges for the smaller courts are elected to four-year terms by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction.
4390,9,georgia,4390,"Georgia consists of 159 counties, second only to Texas, with 254."
4391,9,georgia,4391,"Georgia had 161 counties until the end of 1931, when Milton and Campbell were merged into the existing Fulton."
4392,9,georgia,4392,"Some counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, and many bear names with Native American origin."
4393,9,georgia,4393,"Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county."
4394,9,georgia,4394,"Several counties have a sole Commissioner form of government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person."
4395,9,georgia,4395,Georgia is the only state with current Sole Commissioner counties.
4396,9,georgia,4396,"Georgia's Constitution provides all counties and cities with ""home rule"" authority."
4397,9,georgia,4397,"The county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county, as a municipality would."
4398,9,georgia,4398,"Georgia recognizes all local units of government as cities, so every incorporated town is legally a city."
4399,9,georgia,4399,"Georgia does not provide for townships or independent cities, though there have been bills proposed in the Legislature to provide for townships; it does allow consolidated city-county governments by local referendum."
4400,9,georgia,4400,"All of Georgia's second-tier cities except Savannah have now formed consolidated city-county governments by referendum: Columbus (in 1970), Athens (1990), Augusta (1995), and Macon (2012)."
4401,9,georgia,4401,"(Augusta and Athens have excluded one or more small, incorporated towns within their consolidated boundaries; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all smaller incorporated entities within their consolidated boundaries.)"
4402,9,georgia,4402,The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated city-county government after it merged with unincorporated Chattahoochee County in 2003.
4403,9,georgia,4403,"Three years later, in 2006, the town of Georgetown consolidated with the rest of Quitman County."
4404,9,georgia,4404,"There is no true metropolitan government in Georgia, though the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and Georgia Regional Transportation Authority do provide some services, and the ARC must approve all major land development projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area."
4405,9,georgia,4405,"Georgia had voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a streak that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020."
4406,9,georgia,4406,"Until 1964, Georgia's state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the Democratic Party, of any state in the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407,This record was established largely due to the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408,"Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century."
4409,9,georgia,4409,"White Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence, but this method came into disrepute."
4410,9,georgia,4410,"In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population."
4411,9,georgia,4411,"The whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, nearly half of the state population."
4412,9,georgia,4412,"It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the US and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property."
4413,9,georgia,4413,Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the American Revolution through the Spanish–American War was exempted from these additional qualifications.
4414,9,georgia,4414,"More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted."
4415,9,georgia,4415,"Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote."
4416,9,georgia,4416,"The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote."
4417,9,georgia,4417,The voter rolls dropped dramatically.
4418,9,georgia,4418,"In the early 20th century, Progressives promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics."
4419,9,georgia,4419,"Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate."
4420,9,georgia,4420,White one-party rule was solidified.
4421,9,georgia,4421,"For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly."
4422,9,georgia,4422,"Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats, who were fiscally and socially conservative by national standards."
4423,9,georgia,4423,This voting pattern continued after the segregationist period.
4424,9,georgia,4424,Legal segregation was ended by passage of federal legislation in the 1960s.
4425,9,georgia,4425,"According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the Great Migration to the North and Midwest."
4426,9,georgia,4426,New white residents arrived through migration and immigration.
4427,9,georgia,4427,"Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia."
4428,9,georgia,4428,"In the decades since the late 20th century, the conservative white-majority voters have increasingly supported Republicans for national and state offices."
4429,9,georgia,4429,"In 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor Roy Barnes was defeated by Republican Sonny Perdue, a state legislator and former Democrat."
4430,9,georgia,4430,"While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senatorte when four Democrats switched parties."
4431,9,georgia,4431,They lost the House in the 2004 election.
4432,9,georgia,4432,Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government.
4433,9,georgia,4433,"Even before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections."
4434,9,georgia,4434,It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960.
4435,9,georgia,4435,"In 1976 and 1980, native son Jimmy Carter carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton narrowly won the state."
4436,9,georgia,4436,"Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state."
4437,9,georgia,4437,Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century.
4438,9,georgia,4438,One of the most conservative of these was US
4439,9,georgia,4439,"Congressman Larry McDonald, former head of the John Birch Society, who died when the Soviet Union shot down KAL 007 near Sakhalin Island."
4440,9,georgia,4440,"Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous, as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state."
4441,9,georgia,4441,The ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia US House of Representatives member Newt Gingrich being elected as Speaker of the House following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994.
4442,9,georgia,4442,"Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP."
4443,9,georgia,4443,"Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for president in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries."
4444,9,georgia,4444,"In 2008, Democrat Jim Martin ran against incumbent Republican Senatortor Saxby Chambliss."
4445,9,georgia,4445,Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes.
4446,9,georgia,4446,"In the runoff election held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the US Senatorte."
4447,9,georgia,4447,"In the 2018 elections, the governor remained a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a democratic black female, Stacey Abrams), Republicans lost eight seats in the Georgia House of Representatives (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the Georgia Senatorte (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat US"
4448,9,georgia,4448,"Representatives were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost)."
4449,9,georgia,4449,"In the three presidential elections up to and including 2016, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin."
4450,9,georgia,4450,"This trend led to the state electing Democrat Joe Biden for president in 2020, and it coming to be regarded as a swing state."
4451,9,georgia,4451,"During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance."
4452,9,georgia,4452,"As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census."
4453,9,georgia,4453,"Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the US Supreme Court ruling in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964)."
4454,9,georgia,4454,The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.
4455,9,georgia,4455,"A related case, Reynolds v. Sims (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of ""one man, one vote""; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census."
4456,9,georgia,4456,These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.
4457,9,georgia,4457,"From the mid-1960s, the voting electorate increased after African Americans' rights to vote were enforced under civil rights law."
4458,9,georgia,4458,Economic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region.
4459,9,georgia,4459,"It was a bedrock of the emerging ""New South""."
4460,9,georgia,4460,"From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state."
4461,9,georgia,4461,"In the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former US"
4462,9,georgia,4462,"Senatortor and governor Zell Miller, decided to support Republicans."
4463,9,georgia,4463,The state's socially conservative bent results in wide support for measures such as restrictions on abortion.
4464,9,georgia,4464,"In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages was approved by 76% of voters."
4465,9,georgia,4465,"However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, all Georgia counties came into full compliance, recognizing the rights of same-sex couples to marry in the state."
4466,9,georgia,4466,"In presidential elections, Georgia voted solely Democratic in every election from 1900 to 1960."
4467,9,georgia,4467,"In 1964, it was one of only a handful of states to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater over Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson."
4468,9,georgia,4468,"In 1968, it did not vote for either of the two parties, but rather the American Independent Party and its nominee, Alabama Governor George Wallace."
4469,9,georgia,4469,"In 1972, the state returned to Republicans as part of a landslide victory for Richard Nixon."
4470,9,georgia,4470,"In 1976 and 1980, it voted for Democrat and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter."
4471,9,georgia,4471,"The state returned to Republicans in 1984 and 1988, before going Democratic once again in 1992."
4472,9,georgia,4472,"For every election between that year and 2020, Georgia voted heavily Republican, in line with many of its neighbors in the Deep South."
4473,9,georgia,4473,"In 2020, it voted Democratic for the first time in 28 years, aiding Joe Biden in his defeat of incumbent Republican Donald Trump."
4474,9,georgia,4474,"Prior to 2020, Republicans in state, federal and congressional races had seen decreasing margins of victory, and many election forecasts had ranked Georgia as a ""toss-up"" state, or with Biden as a very narrow favorite."
4475,9,georgia,4475,"Concurrent with the 2020 presidential election were two elections for both of Georgia's United States Senatorte seats (one of which being a special election due to the resignation of Senatortor Johnny Isakson, and the other being regularly scheduled)."
4476,9,georgia,4476,"After no candidate in either race received a majority of the vote, both went to January 5, 2021 run-offs, which Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won."
4477,9,georgia,4477,"Ossoff is the state's first Jewish senator, and Warnock is the state's first Black senator."
4478,9,georgia,4478,"Biden's, Ossoff's, and Warnock's wins were attributed to increased turnout of younger African American voters, particularly around the suburbs of Atlanta and in Savannah, Georgia, due to the work of local organizers such as Stacey Abrams and LaTosha Brown."
4479,9,georgia,4479,Georgia's 2018 total gross state product was $602 billion.
4480,9,georgia,4480,For years Georgia as a state has had the highest credit rating by Standard & Poor's (AAA) and is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating.
4481,9,georgia,4481,"If Georgia were a stand-alone country, it would be the 28th largest economy in the world, based on data from 2005."
4482,9,georgia,4482,"There are 17 Fortune 500 companies and 26 Fortune 1000 companies with headquarters in Georgia, including Home Depot, US Coca-Cola, TSYS, Delta Air Lines, Aflac, Southern Company, Anthem Inc., and SunTrust Banks."
4483,9,georgia,4483,"Atlanta boasts the world's busiest airport, as measured both by passenger traffic and by aircraft traffic."
4484,9,georgia,4484,"Also, the Port of Savannah is the fourth largest seaport and fastest-growing container seaport in North America, importing and exporting a total of 2.3 million TEUs per year."
4485,9,georgia,4485,"Atlanta has a large effect on the state of Georgia, the Southeastern United States, and beyond."
4486,9,georgia,4486,"Atlanta has been the site of growth in finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, service, logistics, transportation, film, communications, convention and trade show businesses and industries, while tourism is important to the economy."

4658,10,hawaii,4658,"Hawaii became a unified, internationally recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until Western businessmen overthrew the monarchy in 1893; this led to annexation by the US in 1898."
4659,10,hawaii,4659,"As a strategically valuable US territory, Hawaii was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global and historical significance, and contributed to America's decisive entry into World War II."
4660,10,hawaii,4660,"Hawaii became the most recent state to join the union on August 21, 1959."
4661,10,hawaii,4661,"In 1993, the US government formally apologized for its role in the overthrow of Hawaii's government, which spurred the Hawaiian sovereignty movement."
4662,10,hawaii,4662,"Historically dominated by a plantation economy, Hawaii remains a major agricultural exporter due to its fertile soil and uniquely tropical climate in the US Its economy has gradually diversified since the mid 20th century, with tourism and military defense becoming the two largest sectors."
4663,10,hawaii,4663,"The state attracts tourists, surfers, and scientists from around the world with its diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big Island."
4664,10,hawaii,4664,"Hawaii hosts the US Pacific Fleet, the largest naval command in the world, as well as 75,000 employees of the Defense Department."
4665,10,hawaii,4665,"Although its relative isolation results in one of the nation's highest costs of living, Hawaii ranks as the third wealthiest state in the US; Honolulu ranks high in several world livability rankings, ranking 22nd out of 140 cities worldwide in the 2019 Global Liveability Index, the highest of any American city."
4666,10,hawaii,4666,"The state of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, Hawaiʻi."
4667,10,hawaii,4667,"A common Hawaiian explanation of the name of Hawaiʻi is that it was named for Hawaiʻiloa, a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth."
4668,10,hawaii,4668,He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.
4669,10,hawaii,4669,"The Hawaiian language word Hawaiʻi is very similar to Proto-Polynesian Sawaiki, with the reconstructed meaning ""homeland""."
4670,10,hawaii,4670,"Cognates of Hawaiʻi are found in other Polynesian languages, including Māori (Hawaiki), Rarotongan (ʻAvaiki) and Samoan (Savaiʻi)."
4671,10,hawaii,4671,"According to linguists Pukui and Elbert, ""elsewhere in Polynesia, Hawaiʻi or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home, but in Hawaii, the name has no meaning""."
4672,10,hawaii,4672,"In 1978, Hawaiian was added to the Constitution of the State of Hawaii as an official state language alongside English."
4673,10,hawaii,4673,The title of the state constitution is The Constitution of the State of Hawaii.
4674,10,hawaii,4674,"Article XV, Section 1 of the Constitution uses The State of Hawaii."
4675,10,hawaii,4675,"Diacritics were not used because the document, drafted in 1949, predates the use of the ʻokina ⟨ʻ⟩ and the kahakō in modern Hawaiian orthography."
4676,10,hawaii,4676,The exact spelling of the state's name in the Hawaiian language is Hawaiʻi.
4677,10,hawaii,4677,"In the Hawaii Admission Act that granted Hawaiian statehood, the federal government recognized Hawaii as the official state name."
4678,10,hawaii,4678,"Official government publications, department and office titles, and the Seal of Hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length."
4679,10,hawaii,4679,"There are eight main Hawaiian islands, seven of which are permanently inhabited."
4680,10,hawaii,4680,The island of Niʻihau is privately managed by brothers Bruce and Keith Robinson
4681,10,hawaii,4681,Access to uninhabited Kahoʻolawe island is also restricted.
4682,10,hawaii,4682,"The Hawaiian archipelago is located 2,000 mi (3,200 km) southwest of the contiguous United States."
4683,10,hawaii,4683,Hawaii is the southernmost US state and the second westernmost after Alaska.
4684,10,hawaii,4684,"Hawaii, like Alaska, does not border any other US state."
4685,10,hawaii,4685,"It is the only US state that is not geographically located in North America, the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago, and the only state in which coffee is commercially cultivable."
4686,10,hawaii,4686,"In addition to the eight main islands, the state has many smaller islands and islets."
4687,10,hawaii,4687,Kaʻula is a small island near Niʻihau.
4688,10,hawaii,4688,"The Northwest Hawaiian Islands is a group of nine small, older islands to the northwest of Kauaʻi that extend from Nihoa to Kure Atoll; these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains."
4689,10,hawaii,4689,"Across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets, such as Molokini, which are either volcanic, marine sedimentary or erosional in origin."
4690,10,hawaii,4690,"Hawaiʻi's tallest mountain Mauna Kea is 13,796 ft (4,205 m) above mean sea level; it is taller than Mount Everest if measured from the base of the mountain, which lies on the floor of the Pacific Ocean and rises about 33,500 feet (10,200 m)."
4691,10,hawaii,4691,The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the Hawaiʻi hotspot.
4692,10,hawaii,4692,"The process is continuing to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes."
4693,10,hawaii,4693,"Because of the hotspot's location, all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of Hawaiʻi Island."
4694,10,hawaii,4694,"The newest volcano, Lōʻihi Seamount, is located south of the coast of Hawaiʻi Island."
4695,10,hawaii,4695,"The last volcanic eruption outside Hawaiʻi Island occurred at Haleakalā on Maui before the late 18th century, possibly hundreds of years earlier."
4696,10,hawaii,4696,"In 1790, Kīlauea exploded; it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the United States."
4697,10,hawaii,4697,"Up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on Kīlauea were killed by the eruption."
4698,10,hawaii,4698,Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features.
4699,10,hawaii,4699,Hawaii Island has the second-highest point among the world's islands.
4700,10,hawaii,4700,"On the flanks of the volcanoes, slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis, particularly in 1868 and 1975."
4701,10,hawaii,4701,Steep cliffs have been created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged flanks of ocean island volcanoes.
4702,10,hawaii,4702,"The Kīlauea erupted in May 2018, opening 22 fissure vents on its East Rift Zone."
4703,10,hawaii,4703,The Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens are situated within this territory.
4704,10,hawaii,4704,"The destruction affected at least 36 buildings and this coupled with the lava flows and the sulfur dioxide fumes, necessitated the evacuation of more than 2,000 local inhabitants from the neighborhoods."
4705,10,hawaii,4705,"Because the islands of Hawaiʻi are distant from other land habitats, life is thought to have arrived there by wind, waves (i.e."
4706,10,hawaii,4706,by ocean currents) and wings (i.e.
4707,10,hawaii,4707,"birds, insects, and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers)."
4708,10,hawaii,4708,"This isolation, in combination with the diverse environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates, and arid shorelines), allowed for the evolution of new endemic flora and fauna."
4709,10,hawaii,4709,Hawaiʻi has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other US state.
4710,10,hawaii,4710,"One endemic plant, Brighamia, now requires hand-pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct."
4711,10,hawaii,4711,The two species of Brighamia—B.
4712,10,hawaii,4712,rockii and B. insignis—are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants.
4713,10,hawaii,4713,"To ensure these plants set seed, biologists rappel down 3,000-foot (910 m) cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas."
4714,10,hawaii,4714,The extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10 million years
4715,10,hawaii,4715,The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field.
4716,10,hawaii,4716,"On a single island, the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimeters annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes, environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters per year), through a temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold, dry climate."
4717,10,hawaii,4717,"The rainy climate impacts soil development, which largely determines ground permeability, affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands."
4718,10,hawaii,4718,Several areas in Hawaiʻi are under the protection of the National Park Service.
4719,10,hawaii,4719,"Hawaii has two national parks: Haleakalā National Park located near Kula on the island of Maui, which features the dormant volcano Haleakalā that formed east Maui, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in the southeast region of the Hawaiʻi Island, which includes the active volcano Kīlauea and its rift zones."
4720,10,hawaii,4720,"There are three national historical parks; Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Kalaupapa, Molokaʻi, the site of a former leper colony; Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park in Kailua-Kona on Hawaiʻi Island; and Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park, an ancient place of refuge on Hawaiʻi Island's west coast."
4721,10,hawaii,4721,Other areas under the control of the National Park Service include Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on Hawaiʻi Island and the USArizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor on Oʻahu.
4722,10,hawaii,4722,"The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument was proclaimed by President George W. Bush on June 15, 2006."
4723,10,hawaii,4723,"The monument covers roughly 140,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls, and shallow and deep sea out to 50 miles (80 km) offshore in the Pacific Ocean—an area larger than all the national parks in the US combined."
4724,10,hawaii,4724,"Hawaiʻi's climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east."
4725,10,hawaii,4725,"Summer highs usually reach around 88 °F (31 °C) during the day, with the temperature reaching a low of 75 °F (24 °C) at night."
4726,10,hawaii,4726,Winter day temperatures are usually around 83 °F (28 °C)
4727,10,hawaii,4727,"Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at 13,800 feet (4,200 m) on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on Hawaii Island in some winter months."
4728,10,hawaii,4728,Snow rarely falls on Haleakalā.
4729,10,hawaii,4729,"Mount Waiʻaleʻale on Kauaʻi has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about 460 inches (12,000 mm) per year."
4730,10,hawaii,4730,Most of Hawaii experiences only two seasons
4731,10,hawaii,4731,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state, in Pahala on April 27, 1931, is 100 °F (38 °C), making it tied with Alaska as the lowest record high temperature observed in a US state."
4732,10,hawaii,4732,"Hawaiʻi's record low temperature is 12 °F (−11 °C) observed in May 1979, on the summit of Mauna Kea."
4733,10,hawaii,4733,Hawaiʻi is the only state to have never recorded sub-zero Fahrenheit temperatures.
4734,10,hawaii,4734,"Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into windward and leeward (koʻolau and kona, respectively) areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains."
4735,10,hawaii,4735,Windward sides face cloud cover.
4736,10,hawaii,4736,Hawaiʻi is one of two states that were widely recognized independent nations prior to joining the United States.
4737,10,hawaii,4737,The Kingdom of Hawaiʻi was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident American and European capitalists and landholders.
4738,10,hawaii,4738,"Hawaiʻi was an independent republic from 1894 until August 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the United States."
4739,10,hawaii,4739,"Hawaiʻi was admitted as a US state on August 21, 1959."
4740,10,hawaii,4740,"Based on archaeological evidence, the earliest habitation of the Hawaiian Islands dates to around AD 300, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands."
4741,10,hawaii,4741,A second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora took place in the 11th century.
4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of the human discovery and habitation of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743,"Some archaeologists and historians think it was a later wave of immigrants from Tahiti around AD 1000 who introduced a new line of high chiefs, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the building of heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744,This later immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (moʻolelo) about Paʻao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745,Other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of Tahitian settlers and that Paʻao must be regarded as a myth.
4746,10,hawaii,4746,"The history of the islands is marked by a slow, steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms, which grew to encompass whole islands."
4747,10,hawaii,4747,"Local chiefs, called aliʻi, ruled their settlements, and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals."
4748,10,hawaii,4748,"Ancient Hawaiʻi was a caste-based society, much like that of Hindus in India."
4749,10,hawaii,4749,The 1778 arrival of British explorer Captain James Cook marked the first documented contact by a European explorer with Hawaiʻi.
4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the archipelago ""the Sandwich Islands"" in honor of his sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the islands' location and rendering the native name as Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form 'Owyhee' or 'Owhyhee' is preserved in the names of certain locations in the American part of the Pacific Northwest, among them Owyhee County and Owyhee Mountains in Idaho, named after three native Hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in the area."
4752,10,hawaii,4752,"It is very possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778."
4753,10,hawaii,4753,"Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 bound for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot."
4754,10,hawaii,4754,"Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe an encounter with either Hawaiʻi or the Marshall Islands."
4755,10,hawaii,4755,"If de Villalobos' crew spotted Hawaiʻi, Gaetano would thus be considered the first European to see the islands."
4756,10,hawaii,4756,Some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility.
4757,10,hawaii,4757,"Nonetheless, Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as Hawaiʻi, but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands."
4758,10,hawaii,4758,"In this manuscript, the island of Maui is named La Desgraciada (The Unfortunate Island), and what appears to be Hawaiʻi Island is named La Mesa (The Table)."
4759,10,hawaii,4759,"Islands resembling Kahoʻolawe', Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi are named Los Monjes (The Monks)."
4760,10,hawaii,4760,"For two-and-a-half centuries, Spanish galleons crossed the Pacific from Mexico along a route that passed south of Hawaiʻi on their way to Manila."
4761,10,hawaii,4761,The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers.
4762,10,hawaii,4762,"Hawaiʻi thus maintained independence, despite being situated on a sea route east–west between nations that were subjects of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, an empire that exercised jurisdiction over many subject civilizations and kingdoms on both sides of the Pacific."
4763,10,hawaii,4763,"Despite such contested claims, Cook is generally credited as being the first European to land at Hawaiʻi, having visited the Hawaiian Islands twice."
4764,10,hawaii,4764,"As he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as Cook took temple idols and fencing as ""firewood"", and a minor chief and his men stole a boat from his ship."
4765,10,hawaii,4765,"Cook abducted the King of Hawaiʻi Island, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of Cook's boat, as this tactic had previously worked in Tahiti and other islands."
4766,10,hawaii,4766,"Instead, the supporters of Kalaniʻōpuʻu attacked, killing Cook and four sailors as Cook's party retreated along the beach to their ship."
4767,10,hawaii,4767,The ship departed without retrieving the stolen boat.
4768,10,hawaii,4768,"After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian Islands attracted many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers, who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies."
4769,10,hawaii,4769,"Early British influence can be seen in the design of the flag of Hawaiʻi, which bears the Union Jack in the top-left corner."
4770,10,hawaii,4770,"These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands, causing the Hawaiian population to drop precipitously."
4771,10,hawaii,4771,"Native Hawaiians had no resistance to Eurasian diseases, such as influenza, smallpox and measles."
4772,10,hawaii,4772,"By 1820, disease, famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the Native Hawaiian population."
4773,10,hawaii,4773,"During the 1850s, measles killed a fifth of Hawaiʻi's people."
4774,10,hawaii,4774,"Historical records indicated the earliest Chinese immigrants to Hawaiʻi originated from Guangdong Province; a few sailors had arrived in 1778 with Captain Cook's journey, and more arrived in 1789 with an American trader who settled in Hawaiʻi in the late 18th century."
4775,10,hawaii,4775,"It is said that leprosy was introduced by Chinese workers by 1830, and as with the other new infectious diseases, it proved damaging to the Hawaiians."
4776,10,hawaii,4776,"During the 1780s, and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power."
4777,10,hawaii,4777,"After a series of battles that ended in 1795, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler, who became known as King Kamehameha the Great."
4778,10,hawaii,4778,"He established the House of Kamehameha, a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872."
4779,10,hawaii,4779,"After Kamehameha II inherited the throne in 1819, American Protestant missionaries to Hawaiʻi converted many Hawaiians to Christianity."
4780,10,hawaii,4780,They used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people.
4781,10,hawaii,4781,"During the reign of King Kamehameha III, Hawaiʻi turned into a Christian monarchy with the signing of the 1840 Constitution."
4782,10,hawaii,4782,"Hiram Bingham I, a prominent Protestant missionary, was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period."
4783,10,hawaii,4783,"Other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs, leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive American subjects."
4784,10,hawaii,4784,"Catholic and Mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom, but they converted a minority of the Native Hawaiian population."
4785,10,hawaii,4785,"Missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at Kalaupapa on Molokaʻi, which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century."
4786,10,hawaii,4786,"The best known were Father Damien and Mother Marianne Cope, both of whom were canonized in the early 21st century as Roman Catholic saints."
4787,10,hawaii,4787,The death of the bachelor King Kamehameha V—who did not name an heir—resulted in the popular election of Lunalilo over Kalākaua.
4788,10,hawaii,4788,"Lunalilo died the next year, also without naming an heir."
4789,10,hawaii,4789,"In 1874, the election was contested within the legislature between Kalākaua and Emma, Queen Consort of Kamehameha IV."
4790,10,hawaii,4790,"After riots broke out, the United States and Britain landed troops on the islands to restore order."
4791,10,hawaii,4791,"King Kalākaua was chosen as monarch by the Legislative Assembly by a vote of 39 to 6 on February 12, 1874."
4792,10,hawaii,4792,"In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi."
4793,10,hawaii,4793,"Drafted by white businessmen and lawyers, the document stripped the king of much of his authority."
4794,10,hawaii,4794,"It established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier, white elite."
4795,10,hawaii,4795,Resident whites were allowed to vote but resident Asians were not.
4796,10,hawaii,4796,"As the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the Bayonet Constitution."
4797,10,hawaii,4797,"King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891."
4798,10,hawaii,4798,"His sister, Queen Liliʻuokalani, succeeded him; she was the last monarch of Hawaiʻi."
4799,10,hawaii,4799,"In 1893, Queen Liliʻuokalani announced plans for a new constitution to proclaim herself an absolute monarch."
4800,10,hawaii,4800,"On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed the Committee of Safety to stage a coup d'état against the kingdom and seek annexation by the United States."
4801,10,hawaii,4801,"United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, responding to a request from the Committee of Safety, summoned a company of US Marines."
4802,10,hawaii,4802,The Queen's soldiers did not resist.
4803,10,hawaii,4803,"According to historian William Russ, the monarchy was unable to protect itself."
4804,10,hawaii,4804,"On January 17, 1893, Queen Liliʻuokalani was overthrown and replaced by a provisional government composed of members of the Committee of Safety."
4805,10,hawaii,4805,The United States Minister to the Kingdom of Hawaii (John L. Stevens) conspired with US citizens to overthrow the monarchy.
4806,10,hawaii,4806,"After the overthrow, Lawyer Sanford B. Dole, a citizen of Hawaii, became President of the Republic when the Provisional Government of Hawaiʻi ended on July 4, 1894."
4807,10,hawaii,4807,Controversy ensued in the following years as the Queen tried to regain her throne.
4808,10,hawaii,4808,"The administration of President Grover Cleveland commissioned the Blount Report, which concluded that the removal of Liliʻuokalani had been illegal."
4809,10,hawaii,4809,"The US government first demanded that Queen Liliʻuokalani be reinstated, but the Provisional Government refused."
4810,10,hawaii,4810,"Congress conducted an independent investigation, and on February 26, 1894, submitted the Morgan Report, which found all parties, including Minister Stevens—with the exception of the Queen—""not guilty"" and not responsible for the coup."
4811,10,hawaii,4811,Partisans on both sides of the debate questioned the accuracy and impartiality of both the Blount and Morgan reports over the events of 1893.
4812,10,hawaii,4812,"In 1993, the US Congress passed a joint Apology Resolution regarding the overthrow; it was signed by President Bill Clinton."
4813,10,hawaii,4813,"The resolution apologized and said that the overthrow was illegal in the following phrase: ""The Congress—on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi on January 17, 1893, acknowledges the historical significance of this event which resulted in the suppression of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people."""
4814,10,hawaii,4814,"The Apology Resolution also ""acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi or through a plebiscite or referendum""."
4815,10,hawaii,4815,"After William McKinley won the 1896 US presidential election, advocates pressed to annex the Republic of Hawaiʻi."
4816,10,hawaii,4816,"The previous president, Grover Cleveland, was a friend of Queen Liliʻuokalani."
4817,10,hawaii,4817,McKinley was open to persuasion by US expansionists and by annexationists from Hawaiʻi.
4818,10,hawaii,4818,"He met with three non-native annexationists: Lorrin A. Thurston, Francis March Hatch and William Ansel Kinney."
4819,10,hawaii,4819,"After negotiations in June 1897, Secretary of State John Sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaiʻi."
4820,10,hawaii,4820,The US Senatorte never ratified the treaty.
4821,10,hawaii,4821,"Despite the opposition of most native Hawaiians, the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the US; it became the Territory of Hawaiʻi."
4822,10,hawaii,4822,"The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House on June 15, 1898, by 209 votes in favor to 91 against, and by the Senatorte on July 6, 1898, by a vote of 42 to 21."
4823,10,hawaii,4823,"In 1900, Hawaiʻi was granted self-governance and retained ʻIolani Palace as the territorial capitol building."
4824,10,hawaii,4824,"Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for 60 years."

5000,10,hawaii,5000,Hawaii's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic US government trade policy.
5001,10,hawaii,5001,"Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of California, Arizona and Florida, Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a ""sunshine tax""."
5002,10,hawaii,5002,"This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well."
5003,10,hawaii,5003,"The higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the Jones Act, which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the US, including between the mainland US west coast and Hawaii, using only US-owned, built, and crewed ships."
5004,10,hawaii,5004,"Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs."
5005,10,hawaii,5005,"While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g."
5006,10,hawaii,5006,"pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages."
5007,10,hawaii,5007,"Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the US west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living."
5008,10,hawaii,5008,Critics of the Jones Act contend that Hawaii consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.

5183,10,hawaii,5183,"Generally, their focus is on self-determination and self-governance, either for Hawaii as an independent nation (in many proposals, for ""Hawaiian nationals"" descended from subjects of the Hawaiian Kingdom or declaring themselves as such by choice), or for people of whole or part native Hawaiian ancestry in an indigenous ""nation to nation"" relationship akin to tribal sovereignty with US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians."
5184,10,hawaii,5184,The pro-federal recognition Akaka Bill drew substantial opposition among Hawaiian residents in the 2000s.
5185,10,hawaii,5185,Opponents to the tribal approach argue it is not a legitimate path to Hawaiian nationhood
5186,10,hawaii,5186,"The Hawaiian sovereignty movement views the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 as illegal, and views the subsequent annexation of Hawaii by the United States as illegal; the movement seeks some form of greater autonomy for Hawaii, such as free association or independence from the United States."
5187,10,hawaii,5187,"Some groups also advocate some form of redress from the United States for the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani, and for what is described as a prolonged military occupation beginning with the 1898 annexation."
5188,10,hawaii,5188,The Apology Resolution passed by US Congress in 1993 is cited as a major impetus by the movement for Hawaiian sovereignty.
5189,10,hawaii,5189,The sovereignty movement considers Hawaii to be an illegally occupied nation.
5190,11,idaho,5190,Idaho ( (listen)) is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.
5191,11,idaho,5191,"It borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west."
5192,11,idaho,5192,"To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia."
5193,11,idaho,5193,"With a population of approximately 1.7 million and an area of 83,570 square miles (216,400 km2), Idaho is the 14th largest, the 12th least populous and the 7th least densely populated of the 50 US states."
5194,11,idaho,5194,The state's capital and largest city is Boise.
5195,11,idaho,5195,For thousands of years Idaho has been inhabited by Native American peoples.
5196,11,idaho,5196,"In the early 19th century, Idaho was considered part of the Oregon Country, an area disputed between the United States and the British Empire."
5197,11,idaho,5197,"It officially became US territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863, instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory."
5198,11,idaho,5198,"Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd state."
5199,11,idaho,5199,"Forming part of the Pacific Northwest (and the associated Cascadia bioregion), Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions."
5200,11,idaho,5200,"The state's north, the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle, is closely linked with Eastern Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone—the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone."
5201,11,idaho,5201,The state's south includes the Snake River Plain (which has most of the population and agricultural land).
5202,11,idaho,5202,The state's southeast incorporates part of the Great Basin.
5203,11,idaho,5203,"Idaho is quite mountainous, and contains several stretches of the Rocky Mountains."
5204,11,idaho,5204,"The United States Forest Service holds about 38% of Idaho's land, the highest proportion of any state."
5205,11,idaho,5205,"Industries significant for the state economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism."
5206,11,idaho,5206,"A number of science and technology firms are either headquartered in Idaho or have factories there, and the state also contains the Idaho National Laboratory, which is the country's largest Department of Energy facility."
5207,11,idaho,5207,"Idaho's agricultural sector supplies many products, but the state is best known for its potato crop, which comprises around one-third of the nationwide yield."
5208,11,idaho,5208,"The official state nickname is the ""Gem State"", which references Idaho's natural beauty."
5209,11,idaho,5209,The name's origin remains a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the US Congress was considering organizing a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician posing as an unrecognized delegate from the unofficial Jefferson Territory."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a Shoshone term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""gem of the mountains"", but it was revealed later that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he had been inspired to coin the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"Since the name appeared to be fabricated, the US Congress ultimately decided to name the area Colorado Territory instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time this decision was made, the town of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been named after Willing's proposal."
5213,11,idaho,5213,"The same year Congress created Colorado Territory, a county called Idaho County was created in eastern Washington Territory."
5214,11,idaho,5214,"The county was named after a steamship named Idaho, which was launched on the Columbia River in 1860."
5215,11,idaho,5215,It is unclear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was revealed.
5216,11,idaho,5216,"Regardless, part of Washington Territory, including Idaho County, was used to create Idaho Territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217,"Eventually, the name was given to the Idaho Territory, which would later become the US state."
5218,11,idaho,5218,"Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well into the 20th century repeated as fact Willing's account the name ""Idaho"" derived from the Shoshone term ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,A 1956 Idaho history textbook says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"An alternative etymology attributes the name to the Plains Apache word ""ídaahę́"" IPA: [í.taː.hɛ̃́] (enemy) that was used in reference to the Comanche."
5221,11,idaho,5221,Idaho borders six US states and one Canadian province.
5222,11,idaho,5222,"The states of Washington and Oregon are to the west, Nevada and Utah are to the south, and Montana and Wyoming are to the east."
5223,11,idaho,5223,Idaho also shares a short border with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north.
5224,11,idaho,5224,The landscape is rugged with some of the largest unspoiled natural areas in the United States.
5225,11,idaho,5225,"For example, at 2.3 million acres (930,000 ha), the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area is the largest contiguous area of protected wilderness in the continental United States."

5229,11,idaho,5229,Shoshone Falls falls down cliffs from a height greater than Niagara Falls.
5230,11,idaho,5230,"By far, the most important river in Idaho is the Snake River, a major tributary of the Columbia River."
5231,11,idaho,5231,"The Snake River flows out from Yellowstone in northwestern Wyoming through the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho before turning north, leaving the state at Lewiston before joining the Columbia in Kennewick."
5232,11,idaho,5232,"Other major rivers are the Clark Fork/Pend Oreille River, the Spokane River, and major tributaries of the Snake river, including the Clearwater River, the Salmon River, the Boise River, and the Payette River."
5233,11,idaho,5233,"The Salmon River empties into the Snake in Hells Canyon and forms the southern boundary of Nez Perce County on its north shore, of which Lewiston is the county seat."
5234,11,idaho,5234,"The Port of Lewiston, at the confluence of the Clearwater and the Snake Rivers is the farthest inland seaport on the West Coast at 465 river miles from the Pacific at Astoria, Oregon."
5235,11,idaho,5235,"The vast majority of Idaho's population lives in the Snake River Plain, a valley running from across the entirety of southern Idaho from east to west."
5236,11,idaho,5236,"The valley contains the major cities of Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Caldwell, Twin Falls, Idaho Falls, and Pocatello."
5237,11,idaho,5237,"The plain served as an easy pass through the Rocky Mountains for westward-bound settlers on the Oregon Trail, and many settlers chose to settle the area rather than risking the treacherous route through the Blue Mountains and the Cascade Range to the west."
5238,11,idaho,5238,"The western region of the plain is known as the Treasure Valley, bound between the Owyhee Mountains to the southwest and the Boise Mountains to the northeast."
5239,11,idaho,5239,The central region of the Snake River Plain is known as the Magic Valley.
5240,11,idaho,5240,"Idaho's highest point is Borah Peak, 12,662 ft (3,859 m), in the Lost River Range north of Mackay."

5242,11,idaho,5242,The Sawtooth Range is often considered Idaho's most famous mountain range.
5243,11,idaho,5243,"Other mountain ranges in Idaho include the Bitterroot Range, the White Cloud Mountains, the Lost River Range, the Clearwater Mountains, and the Salmon River Mountains."
5244,11,idaho,5244,"Idaho has two time zones, with the dividing line approximately midway between Canada and Nevada."
5245,11,idaho,5245,"Southern Idaho, including the Boise metropolitan area, Idaho Falls, Pocatello, and Twin Falls, are in the Mountain Time Zone."

5249,11,idaho,5249,"Areas north of the Salmon River, including Coeur d'Alene, Moscow, Lewiston, and Sandpoint, are in the Pacific Time Zone, which contains less than a quarter of the state's population and land area."
5250,11,idaho,5250,Idaho's climate varies widely.
5251,11,idaho,5251,"Although the state's western border is about 350 miles (560 km) from the Pacific Ocean, the maritime influence is still felt in Idaho, especially in the winter when cloud cover, humidity, and precipitation are at their maximum extent."
5252,11,idaho,5252,This influence has a moderating effect in the winter where temperatures are not as low as would otherwise be expected for a northern state with predominantly high elevations.
5253,11,idaho,5253,"The maritime influence is least prominent in the state's eastern part where the precipitation patterns are often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid continental climate."
5254,11,idaho,5254,"Idaho can be hot, although extended periods over 98 °F (37 °C) are rare, except for the lowest point in elevation, Lewiston, which correspondingly sees little snow."
5255,11,idaho,5255,"Hot summer days are tempered by the low relative humidity and cooler evenings during summer months since, for most of the state, the highest diurnal difference in temperature is often in the summer."
5256,11,idaho,5256,"Winters can be cold, although extended periods of bitter cold weather below zero are unusual."
5257,11,idaho,5257,"Idaho's all-time highest temperature of 118 °F (48 °C) was recorded at Orofino on July 28, 1934; the all-time lowest temperature of −60 °F (−51 °C) was recorded at Island Park Dam on January 18, 1943."
5258,11,idaho,5258,"Humans may have been present in the Idaho area as long as 14,500 years ago."
5259,11,idaho,5259,"Excavations at Wilson Butte Cave near Twin Falls in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America."
5260,11,idaho,5260,American Indian peoples predominant in the area included the Nez Percé in the north and the Northern and Western Shoshone in the south.
5261,11,idaho,5261,A Late Upper Paleolithic site was identified at Cooper's Ferry in western Idaho near the town of Cottonwood by archaeologists in 2019.
5262,11,idaho,5262,"Based on evidence found at the site, first people lived in this area 15,300 to 16,600 years ago, predating the Beringia land bridge by about a thousand years."
5263,11,idaho,5263,"The discoverers, anthropology professor Loren Davis and colleagues, emphasized that they possess similarities with tools and artifacts discovered in Japan that date from 16,000 to 13,000 years ago."
5264,11,idaho,5264,"The discovery also showed that the first people might not have come to North America by land, as previously theorized."
5265,11,idaho,5265,"On the contrary, they probably came through the water, using a Pacific coastal road."
5266,11,idaho,5266,"An early presence of French-Canadian trappers is visible in names and toponyms: Nez Percé, Cœur d'Alène, Boisé, Payette, some preexisting the Lewis and Clark and Astorian expeditions which themselves included significant numbers of French and Métis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain."
5267,11,idaho,5267,"Idaho, as part of the Oregon Country, was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846."
5268,11,idaho,5268,"From 1843 to 1849, present-day Idaho was under the de facto jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon."
5269,11,idaho,5269,"When Oregon became a state, what is now Idaho was in what remained of the original Oregon Territory not part of the new state, and designated as the Washington Territory."
5270,11,idaho,5270,"Between then and the creation of the Idaho Territory on March 4, 1863, at Lewiston, parts of the present-day state were included in the Oregon, Washington, and Dakota Territories."
5271,11,idaho,5271,"The new territory included present-day Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming."
5272,11,idaho,5272,"The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific and in 1806 on the return, largely following the Clearwater River both directions."
5273,11,idaho,5273,"The first non-indigenous settlement was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Lake Pend Oreille for fur trading in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company."
5274,11,idaho,5274,"In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near present-day Lewiston."
5275,11,idaho,5275,"This post, known as ""MacKenzie's Post"" or ""Clearwater"", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was bought out by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned."
5276,11,idaho,5276,"The first attempts at organized communities, within the present borders of Idaho, were established in 1860."
5277,11,idaho,5277,"The first permanent, substantial incorporated community was Lewiston in 1861."
5278,11,idaho,5278,"After some tribulation as a territory, including the chaotic transfer of the territorial capital from Lewiston to Boise, disenfranchisement of Mormon polygamists upheld by the US Supreme Court in 1877, and a federal attempt to split the territory between Washington Territory which gained statehood in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho achieved statehood in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,Idaho was one of the hardest hit of the Pacific Northwest states during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280,"Prices plummeted for Idaho's major crops: in 1932 a bushel of potatoes brought only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income of $686 in 1929 drop to $250 by 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest single economic center (over 25% of the state's total revenue) within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined."
5283,11,idaho,5283,"The United States Census Bureau estimates Idaho's population was 1,787,065 on July 1, 2018, a 14% increase since 2010."
5284,11,idaho,5284,"Idaho had an estimated population of 1,754,208 in 2018, which was an increase of 37,265, from the prior year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010."
5285,11,idaho,5285,"This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 75,795 people into the state."
5286,11,idaho,5286,There are large numbers of Americans of English and German ancestry in Idaho.
5287,11,idaho,5287,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 61,273 people."
5288,11,idaho,5288,"This made Idaho the tenth fastest-growing state after District of Columbia (+16.74%), Utah (+14.37%), Texas (+14.14%), Florida (+13.29%), Colorado (+13.25%), North Dakota (+13.01%), Nevada (+12.36%), Arizona (+12.20%) and Washington."
5289,11,idaho,5289,"From 2017 to 2018, Idaho grew the second-fastest, surpassed only by Nevada."
5290,11,idaho,5290,"Nampa, about 20 miles (30 km) west of downtown Boise, became the state's second largest city in the late 1990s, passing Pocatello and Idaho Falls."
5291,11,idaho,5291,"Nampa's population was under 29,000 in 1990 and grew to over 81,000 by 2010."
5292,11,idaho,5292,"Located between Nampa and Boise, Meridian also experienced high growth, from fewer than 10,000 residents in 1990 to more than 75,000 in 2010 and is now Idaho's third largest city."
5293,11,idaho,5293,"Growth of 5% or more over the same period has also been observed in Caldwell, Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls, and Twin Falls."

5299,11,idaho,5299,"The five largest ancestry groups were: German (17.5%), English (16.4%), Irish (9.3%), American (8.1%), and Scottish (3.2%)."
5300,11,idaho,5300,"Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number."
5301,11,idaho,5301,"According to the Pew Research Center on Religion & Public Life, the self-identified religious affiliations of Idahoans over the age of 18 in 2008 and 2014 were:"

5344,11,idaho,5344,"Food is taxed, but prescription drugs are not."
5345,11,idaho,5345,"Hotel, motel, and campground accommodations are taxed at a higher rate (7% to 11%)."
5346,11,idaho,5346,Some jurisdictions impose local option sales tax.
5347,11,idaho,5347,"The sales tax was introduced at 3% in 1965, easily approved by voters, where it remained at 3% until 1983."
5348,11,idaho,5348,"As of 2017, the primary energy source in Idaho was hydropower, and the energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatthours (MWh)."
5349,11,idaho,5349,"As of 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market, with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission regulating the three major utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power, and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,Idaho's energy landscape is favorable to the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,The state is rich in renewable energy resources but has limited fossil fuel resources.
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller river basins provide Idaho with some of the nation's best hydroelectric power resources and its geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind power potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353,These realities have shaped much of the state's energy landscape.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports most of the energy it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355,"Imports account for more than 80% of energy consumption, including all of Idaho's natural gas and petroleum supplies and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"Of the electricity consumed in Idaho in 2005, 48% came from hydroelectricity, 42% was generated by burning coal and 9% was generated by burning natural gas."
5357,11,idaho,5357,The remainder came from other renewable sources such as wind.
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The state's numerous river basins allow hydroelectric power plants to provide 556,000 MWh, which amounts to about three-fourths of Idaho's electricity generated in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,Washington State provides most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two major pipeline systems supplying the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360,"Although the state relies on out-of-state sources for its entire natural gas supply, it uses natural gas-fired plants to generate 127,000 MWh, or about ten percent of its output."
5361,11,idaho,5361,Coal-fired generation and the state's small array of wind turbines supplies the remainder of the state's electricity output.
5362,11,idaho,5362,"The state produces 739,000 MWh but still needs to import half of its electricity from out-of-state to meet demand."
5363,11,idaho,5363,"While Idaho's 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) total energy consumption is low compared with other states and represents just 0.5% of United States consumption, the state also has the nation's 11th smallest population, 1.5 million, so its per capita energy consumption of 352 million BTU (103 MWh) is just above the national average of 333 million BTU (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th‑largest state in terms of land area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), distance creates the additional problem of ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365,"When the length of an electrical transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electric current passing through it is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States with the population expected to increase by 31% from 2008 to 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367,"This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, further straining Idaho's finite hydroelectric resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has an upper-boundary estimate of development potential to generate 44,320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind power, and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar power using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of rooftop photovoltaics, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar power."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Transportation Department is the government agency responsible for Idaho's transportation infrastructure, including operations and maintenance as well as planning for future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The agency is also responsible for overseeing the disbursement of federal, state, and grant funding for the transportation programs of the state."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is among the few states in the nation without a major freeway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"US-95 links the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it is badly in need of repair and upgrade."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Transportation Department stated the state's highway infrastructure faces a $200 million per year shortfall in maintenance and upgrades."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main highway linking the southeast and southwest portions of the state, along with I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Major federal aid highways in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"Major airports include the Boise International Airport which serves the southwest region of Idaho and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) which serves northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377,"Other airports with scheduled service are the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving the Palouse; the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport, serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and north central and west central Idaho; The Magic Valley Regional Airport in Twin Falls; the Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and the Pocatello Regional Airport."
5378,11,idaho,5378,Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland, and Spokane to the west, and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"The BNSF travels through Kootenai, Bonner, and Boundary counties."
5381,11,idaho,5381,"The Union Pacific Railroad crosses North Idaho entering from Canada through Boundary and Bonner, and proceeding to Spokane."
5382,11,idaho,5382,"Canadian Pacific Railway uses Union Pacific Railroad tracks in North Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon."
5383,11,idaho,5383,"Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop being in Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384,"Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho"
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific Railroad also crosses southern Idaho traveling between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming, and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls, and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,The Port of Lewiston is the farthest inland Pacific port on the west coast.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and Columbia River facilitate barge travel from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded on ocean-going vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,The constitution of Idaho is roughly modeled on the national constitution with several additions.
5389,11,idaho,5389,"The constitution defines the form and functions of the state government, and may be amended through plebiscite."
5390,11,idaho,5390,"Notably, the state constitution presently requires the state government to maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391,"As result, Idaho has limited debt (construction bonds, etc."
5392,11,idaho,5392,).
5393,11,idaho,5393,All of Idaho's state laws are contained in the Idaho Code and Statutes.
5394,11,idaho,5394,The code is amended through the legislature with the approval of the governor.
5395,11,idaho,5395,Idaho still operates under its original (1889) state constitution.
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The constitution of Idaho provides for three branches of government: the executive, legislative and judicial branches."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected from 35 legislative districts, each represented by one senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398,"Since 1946, statewide elected constitutional officers have been elected to four-year terms."
5399,11,idaho,5399,"They include: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Idaho state controller (Auditor before 1994), Treasurer, Attorney General, and Superintendent of Public Instruction."
5400,11,idaho,5400,"Last contested in 1966, Inspector of Mines was an originally elected constitutional office."
5401,11,idaho,5401,Afterward it was an appointed position and ultimately done away with entirely in 1974.
5402,11,idaho,5402,Idaho's government has an alcohol monopoly.
5403,11,idaho,5403,"The governor of Idaho serves a four-year term, and is elected during what is nationally referred to as midterm elections."
5404,11,idaho,5404,"As such, the governor is not elected in the same election year as the president of the United States."
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current governor is Republican Brad Little, who was elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,Idaho's legislature is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407,"However, the session may be extended if necessary, and often is."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"Because of this, Idaho's legislators are considered ""citizen legislators"", meaning their position as a legislator is not their main occupation."
5409,11,idaho,5409,Terms for both the Senatorte and House of Representatives are two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410,Legislative elections occur every even numbered year.
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The Idaho Legislature has been continuously controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although Democratic legislators are routinely elected from Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and the northern Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,The highest court in Idaho is the Idaho Supreme Court.
5413,11,idaho,5413,"There is also an intermediate appellate court, the Idaho Court of Appeals, which hears cases assigned to it from the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The state's District Courts serve seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416,"Since 1919 there are 44 counties in the state, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 km2)."
5417,11,idaho,5417,Three counties were first designated as such by the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861
5418,11,idaho,5418,"The 1861 Nez Percé county has since been broken up into Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai, and Clearwater counties."
5419,11,idaho,5419,Idaho license plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county's name.
5420,11,idaho,5420,"Where a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number accompanies precedingly in alphabetical order."
5421,11,idaho,5421,"This reflects an anomalous coincidental situation wherein 10 counties begin with B, seven with C and four with L, which is 21 of the 44 counties."
5422,11,idaho,5422,"After the Civil War, many Midwestern and Southern Democrats moved to the Idaho Territory."
5423,11,idaho,5423,"As a result, the early territorial legislatures were solidly Democrat-controlled."
5424,11,idaho,5424,"In contrast, most of the territorial governors were appointed by Republican presidents and were Republicans."
5425,11,idaho,5425,"This led to sometimes-bitter clashes between the two parties, including a range war with the Democrats backing the sheepherders and the Republicans the cattlemen, which ended in the ""Diamondfield"" Jack Davis murder trial."
5426,11,idaho,5426,"In the 1880s, Republicans became more prominent in local politics."
5427,11,idaho,5427,"In 1864, Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and the state constitution from a locked safe, and took them to Boise."
5428,11,idaho,5428,"This effectively moved the capital from where they were stored (Lewiston, Idaho) to the current capital Boise."
5429,11,idaho,5429,"Since statehood, the Republican Party has usually been the dominant party in Idaho."
5430,11,idaho,5430,"At one time, Idaho had two Democratic parties, one being the mainstream and the other called the Anti-Mormon Democrats, lasting into the early 20th century."
5431,11,idaho,5431,"In the 1890s and early 1900s, the Populist Party enjoyed prominence while the Democratic Party maintained a brief dominance in the 1930s during the Great Depression."
5432,11,idaho,5432,"Since World War II most statewide-elected officials have been Republicans, though the Democrats did hold the majority in the House (by one seat) in 1958 and the governorship from 1971 to 1995."
5433,11,idaho,5433,Idaho Congressional delegations have also been generally Republican since statehood.
5434,11,idaho,5434,"Several Idaho Democrats have had electoral success in the House over the years, but the Senatorte delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades."
5435,11,idaho,5435,"Several Idaho Republicans, including current Senatortor Mike Crapo, have won reelection to the Senatorte, but only Frank Church has won reelection as a Democrat."
5436,11,idaho,5436,"Church was the last Idaho Democrat to win a US Senatorte race, in 1974."
5437,11,idaho,5437,Walt Minnick's 2008 win in the First Congressional District was the state's first Democratic Congressional victory in 16 years.
5438,11,idaho,5438,"In modern times, Idaho has been a reliably Republican state in presidential politics."
5439,11,idaho,5439,It has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964.
5440,11,idaho,5440,"Even in that election, Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in the state by fewer than two percentage points, compared to a landslide nationally."
5441,11,idaho,5441,"In 2004, Republican George W. Bush carried Idaho by a margin of 38 percentage points and with 68.4% of the vote, winning in 43 of 44 counties."
5442,11,idaho,5442,"Only Blaine County, which contains the Sun Valley ski resort, supported John Kerry, who owns a home in the area."
5443,11,idaho,5443,In 2008 Barack Obama's 36.1 percent showing was the best for a Democratic presidential candidate in Idaho since 1976.
5444,11,idaho,5444,"However, Republican margins were narrower in 1992 and 1976."
5445,11,idaho,5445,"In the 2006 elections, Republicans, led by gubernatorial candidate CL ""Butch"" Otter, won all the state's constitutional offices and retained both of the state's seats in the United States House of Representatives."
5446,11,idaho,5446,"However, Democrats picked up several seats in the Idaho Legislature, notably in the Boise area."
5447,11,idaho,5447,"Republicans lost one of the House seats in 2008 to Minnick, but Republican Jim Risch retained Larry Craig's Senatorte seat for the GOP by a comfortable margin."
5448,11,idaho,5448,Minnick lost his seat in the 2010 election to Republican State Rep. Raul Labrador.
5449,11,idaho,5449,"In 2020, Idaho overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump."
5450,11,idaho,5450,"Despite the view that Idaho's bigger cities are ""blue islands in a sea of red"", as several articles have put it; that was not the case in 2020."
5451,11,idaho,5451,"Only 3 Idaho counties went blue, and those were Latah, Blaine, and Teton counties, respectively."
5452,11,idaho,5452,Every Republican candidate running won their respective race and Idaho residents voted overwhelmingly to retain Republican judges.
5453,11,idaho,5453,"Additionally, ballot measures leaned towards the right."
5454,11,idaho,5454,Medical/recreational marijuana and a crime bill to give victims more rights were absent from the ballot.
5455,11,idaho,5455,"Former Vice President, Joe Biden, received roughly 33.6 percent of the votes, which was slightly lower than what was received by former president, Barack Obama."
5456,11,idaho,5456,"As of January 2020, the State of Idaho contains 105 school districts and 62 charter schools."
5457,11,idaho,5457,"The school districts range in enrollment from two to 39,507 students."
5458,11,idaho,5458,"Idaho school districts are governed by elected school boards, which are elected in November of odd-numbered years, except for the Boise School District, whose elections are held in September."

5462,11,idaho,5462,"Idaho State University in Pocatello opened in 1901 as the Academy of Idaho, attained four-year status in 1947 and university status in 1963."
5463,11,idaho,5463,Boise State University is the most recent school to attain university status in Idaho.
5464,11,idaho,5464,The school opened in 1932 as Boise Junior College and became Boise State University in 1974.
5465,11,idaho,5465,"Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston is the only public, non-university four-year college in Idaho."
5466,11,idaho,5466,It opened as a normal school in 1893.
5467,11,idaho,5467,"Idaho has four regional community colleges: North Idaho College in Coeur d'Alene; College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls; College of Western Idaho in Nampa, which opened in 2009, College of Eastern Idaho in Idaho Falls, which transitioned from a technical college in 2017."
5468,11,idaho,5468,"Private institutions in Idaho are Boise Bible College, affiliated with congregations of the Christian churches and churches of Christ; Brigham Young University-Idaho in Rexburg, which is affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a sister college to Brigham Young University; The College of Idaho in Caldwell, which still maintains a loose affiliation with the Presbyterian Church; Northwest Nazarene University in Nampa; and New Saint Andrews College in Moscow, of reformed Christian theological background."

5484,12,illinois,5484,Illinois has been noted as a microcosm of the entire United States.
5485,12,illinois,5485,"With Chicago in northeastern Illinois, small industrial cities and immense agricultural productivity in the north and center of the state, and natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base, and is a major transportation hub."

5494,12,illinois,5494,"Following increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes after the construction of the Erie Canal, Chicago was incorporated in the 1830s on the banks of the Chicago River at one of the few natural harbors on the southern section of Lake Michigan."
5495,12,illinois,5495,"John Deere's invention of the self-scouring steel plow turned Illinois's rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden."
5496,12,illinois,5496,"The Illinois and Michigan Canal (1848) made transportation between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River valley faster and cheaper, and new railroads carried immigrants to new homes in the country's west and shipped commodity crops to the nation's east."

5508,12,illinois,5508,"""Illinois"" is the modern spelling for the early French Catholic missionaries and explorers' name for the Illinois Native Americans, a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records."
5509,12,illinois,5509,"American scholars previously thought the name ""Illinois"" meant ""man"" or ""men"" in the Miami-Illinois language, with the original iliniwek transformed via French into Illinois."
5510,12,illinois,5510,"This etymology is not supported by the Illinois language, as the word for ""man"" is ireniwa, and plural of ""man"" is ireniwaki."

5518,12,illinois,5518,"Diverse marine life lived at this time, including trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoids."
5519,12,illinois,5519,Changing environmental conditions led to the formation of large coal swamps in the Carboniferous.
5520,12,illinois,5520,"Illinois was above sea level for at least part of the Mesozoic, but by its end was again submerged by the Western Interior Seaway."
5521,12,illinois,5521,This receded by the Eocene Epoch.
5522,12,illinois,5522,"During the Pleistocene Epoch, vast ice sheets covered much of Illinois, with only the Driftless Area remaining exposed."
5523,12,illinois,5523,These glaciers carved the basin of Lake Michigan and left behind traces of ancient glacial lakes and moraines.
5524,12,illinois,5524,American Indians of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.
5525,12,illinois,5525,"The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation."
5526,12,illinois,5526,"Cahokia, the largest regional chiefdom and Urban Center of the Pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois."
5527,12,illinois,5527,"They built an urban complex of more than 100 platform and burial mounds, a 50-acre (20 ha) plaza larger than 35 football fields, and a woodhenge of sacred cedar, all in a planned design expressing the culture's cosmology."
5528,12,illinois,5528,"Monks Mound, the center of the site, is the largest Pre-Columbian structure north of the Valley of Mexico."
5529,12,illinois,5529,"It is 100 feet (30 m) high, 951 feet (290 m) long, 836 feet (255 m) wide, and covers 13.8 acres (5.6 ha)."
5530,12,illinois,5530,"It contains about 814,000 cubic yards (622,000 m3) of earth."
5531,12,illinois,5531,"It was topped by a structure thought to have measured about 105 feet (32 m) in length and 48 feet (15 m) in width, covered an area 5,000 square feet (460 m2), and been as much as 50 feet (15 m) high, making its peak 150 feet (46 m) above the level of the plaza."
5532,12,illinois,5532,"The finely crafted ornaments and tools recovered by archaeologists at Cahokia include elaborate ceramics, finely sculptured stonework, carefully embossed and engraved copper and mica sheets, and one funeral blanket for an important chief fashioned from 20,000 shell beads."
5533,12,illinois,5533,"These artifacts indicate that Cahokia was truly an urban center, with clustered housing, markets, and specialists in toolmaking, hide dressing, potting, jewelry making, shell engraving, weaving and salt making."
5534,12,illinois,5534,"The civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources."
5535,12,illinois,5535,Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare.
5536,12,illinois,5536,"According to Suzanne Austin Alchon, ""At one site in the central Illinois River valley, one third of all adults died as a result of violent injuries."""
5537,12,illinois,5537,"The next major power in the region was the Illinois Confederation or Illini, a political alliance."
5538,12,illinois,5538,"As the Illini declined during the Beaver Wars era, members of the Algonquian-speaking Potawatomi, Miami, Sauk, and other tribes including the Fox (Mesquakie), Ioway, Kickapoo, Mascouten, Piankashaw, Shawnee, Wea, and Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) came into the area from the east and north around the Great Lakes."
5539,12,illinois,5539,French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Illinois River in 1673.
5540,12,illinois,5540,Marquette soon after founded a mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois in Illinois Country.
5541,12,illinois,5541,"In 1680, French explorers under René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti constructed a fort at the site of present-day Peoria, and in 1682, a fort atop Starved Rock in today's Starved Rock State Park."
5542,12,illinois,5542,"French Empire Canadiens came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of first New France, and then of La Louisiane until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the Seven Years' War."
5543,12,illinois,5543,"The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to Ste."

5545,12,illinois,5545,"A few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians, and then part of the British Province of Quebec."
5546,12,illinois,5546,"In 1778, George Rogers Clark claimed Illinois County for Virginia."
5547,12,illinois,5547,"In a compromise, Virginia (and other states that made various claims) ceded the area to the new United States in the 1780s and it became part of the Northwest Territory, administered by the federal government and later organized as states."
5548,12,illinois,5548,The Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois.
5549,12,illinois,5549,"The Illinois Territory was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at Kaskaskia, an early French settlement."
5550,12,illinois,5550,"During the discussions leading up to Illinois's admission to the Union, the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice."
5551,12,illinois,5551,The original provisions of the Northwest Ordinance had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan.
5552,12,illinois,5552,Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all.
5553,12,illinois,5553,"However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a 10-mile (16 km) northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan."
5554,12,illinois,5554,"However, the Illinois delegate, Nathaniel Pope, wanted more, and lobbied to have the boundary moved further north."
5555,12,illinois,5555,"The final bill passed by Congress included an amendment to shift the border to 42° 30' north, which is approximately 51 miles (82 km) north of the Indiana northern border."
5556,12,illinois,5556,"This shift added 8,500 square miles (22,000 km2) to the state, including the lead mining region near Galena."
5557,12,illinois,5557,"More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River."
5558,12,illinois,5558,Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers and thus connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.
5559,12,illinois,5559,"In 1818, Illinois became the 21st US state."
5560,12,illinois,5560,"The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state."
5561,12,illinois,5561,"In 1819, Vandalia became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building."
5562,12,illinois,5562,"In 1837, the state legislators representing Sangamon County, under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield, where a fifth capitol building was constructed."
5563,12,illinois,5563,"A sixth capitol building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today."
5564,12,illinois,5564,"Though it was ostensibly a ""free state"", there was nonetheless slavery in Illinois."
5565,12,illinois,5565,"The ethnic French had owned black slaves since the 1720s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky."
5566,12,illinois,5566,"Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves."
5567,12,illinois,5567,"When Illinois became a sovereign state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state."
5568,12,illinois,5568,"As the southern part of the state, later known as ""Egypt"" or ""Little Egypt"", was largely settled by migrants from the South, the section was hostile to free blacks."
5569,12,illinois,5569,"Settlers were allowed to bring slaves with them for labor, but, in 1822, state residents voted against making slavery legal."
5570,12,illinois,5570,"Still, most residents opposed allowing free blacks as permanent residents."
5571,12,illinois,5571,Some settlers brought in slaves seasonally or as house servants.
5572,12,illinois,5572,The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed.
5573,12,illinois,5573,"In 1853, John A. Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state."
5574,12,illinois,5574,"The winter of 1830–1831 is called the ""Winter of the Deep Snow""; a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished."
5575,12,illinois,5575,"Several severe winters followed, including the ""Winter of the Sudden Freeze""."
5576,12,illinois,5576,"On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter."
5577,12,illinois,5577,The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state.
5578,12,illinois,5578,"The southern part of the state shipped food north, and this may have contributed to its name: ""Little Egypt"", after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers."
5579,12,illinois,5579,"In 1832, the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki), and Kickapoo Indian tribes."
5580,12,illinois,5580,It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region.
5581,12,illinois,5581,"The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to Iowa in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by US militia."
5582,12,illinois,5582,The survivors were forced back to Iowa.
5583,12,illinois,5583,"By 1839, the Latter Day Saints had founded a utopian city called Nauvoo."
5584,12,illinois,5584,"Located in Hancock County along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished, and soon rivaled Chicago for the position of the state's largest city."
5585,12,illinois,5585,"But in 1844, the Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith was killed in the Carthage Jail, about 30 miles away from Nauvoo."
5586,12,illinois,5586,"Following a succession crisis (Latter Day Saints), Brigham Young led most Latter Day Saints out of Illinois in a mass exodus to present-day Utah; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo rapidly declined afterward."
5587,12,illinois,5587,"After it was established in 1833, Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port, and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward."

5592,12,illinois,5592,"King, a Jacksonville, Illinois businessman, who invited her to Illinois, where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane."
5593,12,illinois,5593,"With the lobbying expertise of Dix, plans for the Jacksonville State Hospital (now known as the Jacksonville Developmental Center) were signed into law on March 1, 1847."
5594,12,illinois,5594,"During the American Civil War, Illinois ranked fourth in men who served (more than 250,000) in the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio."
5595,12,illinois,5595,"Beginning with President Abraham Lincoln's first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments."
5596,12,illinois,5596,"Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments."
5597,12,illinois,5597,"The town of Cairo, at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the Union army."

5645,12,illinois,5645,"The midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called Central Illinois."
5646,12,illinois,5646,It is an area of mainly prairie and known as the Heart of Illinois.

5658,12,illinois,5658,"In addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago Metropolitan area is often called ""downstate"" Illinois."
5659,12,illinois,5659,"This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area."
5660,12,illinois,5660,"Thus, some cities in Northern Illinois, such as DeKalb, which is west of Chicago, and Rockford—which is actually north of Chicago—are sometimes incorrectly considered to be 'downstate'."
5661,12,illinois,5661,Illinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year.
5662,12,illinois,5662,"Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), with hot, humid summers and cold winters."

5674,12,illinois,5674,"Illinois's population declined by 69,259 people from July 2018 to July 2019, making it the worst decline of any state in the US in raw terms."
5675,12,illinois,5675,"This includes a natural increase since the last census of 462,146 people (i.e., 1,438,187 births minus 976,041 deaths) and an decrease due to net migration of 622,928 people."
5676,12,illinois,5676,"Immigration resulted in a net increase of 242,945 people, and migration from within the US resulted in a net decrease of 865,873 people."
5677,12,illinois,5677,Illinois is the most populous state in the Midwest region.
5678,12,illinois,5678,"Chicago, the third-most populous city in the United States, is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area or Chicagoland, as this area is nicknamed."

6354,13,indiana,6354,"Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises."
6355,13,indiana,6355,This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid.
6356,13,indiana,6356,Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.
6357,13,indiana,6357,"In 2016, Indiana was home to seven Fortune 500 companies with a combined $142.5 billion in revenue."
6358,13,indiana,6358,"Columbus-based Cummins, Inc. and Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Company and Simon Property Group were recognized in Fortune publication's ""2017 World's Most Admired Companies List"", ranking in each of their respective industries."
6359,13,indiana,6359,Northwest Indiana has been the largest steel producing center in the US since 1975 and accounted for 27 percent of American-made steel in 2016.
6360,13,indiana,6360,"Indiana is home to the international headquarters and research facilities of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, the state's largest corporation, as well as the world headquarters of Mead Johnson Nutritionals in Evansville."
6361,13,indiana,6361,"Overall, Indiana ranks fifth among all US states in total sales and shipments of pharmaceutical products and second highest in the number of biopharmaceutical related jobs."
6362,13,indiana,6362,Indiana is within the US Corn Belt and Grain Belt.
6363,13,indiana,6363,The state has a feedlot-style system raising corn to fatten hogs and cattle.
6364,13,indiana,6364,"Along with corn, soybeans are also a major cash crop."
6365,13,indiana,6365,"Its proximity to large urban centers, such as Indianapolis and Chicago, assure dairying, egg production, and specialty horticulture occur.Other crops include melons, tomatoes, grapes, mint, popping corn, and tobacco in the southern counties."
6366,13,indiana,6366,Most of the original land was not prairie and had to be cleared of deciduous trees.
6367,13,indiana,6367,Many parcels of woodland remain and support a furniture-making sector in the southern portion of the state.
6368,13,indiana,6368,In 2011 Indiana was ranked first in the Midwest and sixth in the country for best places to do business according to CEO magazine.
6369,13,indiana,6369,Tax is collected by the Indiana Department of Revenue.
6370,13,indiana,6370,Indiana has a flat state income tax rate of 3.23%.
6371,13,indiana,6371,Many of the state's counties also collect income tax.
6372,13,indiana,6372,"The state sales tax rate is 7% with exemptions for food, prescription medications and over-the-counter medications."
6373,13,indiana,6373,"In some jurisdictions, an additional Food and Beverage Tax is charged, at a rate of 1% (Marion County's rate is 2%), on sales of prepared meals and beverages."
6374,13,indiana,6374,Property taxes are imposed on both real and personal property in Indiana and are administered by the Department of Local Government Finance.
6375,13,indiana,6375,"Property is subject to taxation by a variety of taxing units (schools, counties, townships, municipalities, and libraries), making the total tax rate the sum of the tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which a property is located."
6376,13,indiana,6376,"However, a ""circuit breaker"" law enacted on March 19, 2008 limits property taxes to 1% of assessed value for homeowners, 2% for rental properties and farmland, and 3% for businesses."
6377,13,indiana,6377,Indiana does not have a legal requirement to balance the state budget either in law or its constitution.
6378,13,indiana,6378,"Instead, it has a constitutional ban on assuming debt."
6379,13,indiana,6379,The state has a Rainy Day Fund and for healthy reserves proportional to spending.
6380,13,indiana,6380,Indiana is one of six US states to not allow a line-item veto.
6381,13,indiana,6381,"Since 2010, Indiana has been one of a few states to hold AAA bond credit ratings with the Big Three credit rating agencies, the highest possible rating."
6382,13,indiana,6382,"Indiana's power production chiefly consists of the consumption of fossil fuels, mainly coal."
6383,13,indiana,6383,"It has 24 coal power plants, including the country's largest coal power plant, Gibson Generating Station, across the Wabash River from Mount Carmel, Illinois."
6384,13,indiana,6384,"Indiana is also home to the coal-fired plant with the highest sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States, the Gallagher power plant, just west of New Albany."
6385,13,indiana,6385,"In 2010, Indiana had estimated coal reserves of 57 billion tons, and state mining operations produced 35 million tons of coal annually."
6386,13,indiana,6386,"Indiana also has at least 900 million barrels of petroleum reserves in the Trenton Field, though they are not easily recoverable."
6387,13,indiana,6387,"While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, progress has been very slow, mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana."
6388,13,indiana,6388,Most of the new plants in the state have been coal gasification plants.
6389,13,indiana,6389,Another source is hydroelectric power.
6390,13,indiana,6390,Wind power has been developed.
6391,13,indiana,6391,"Estimates in 2006 raised Indiana's wind capacity from 30 MW at 50 m turbine height to 40,000 MW at 70 m, and to 130,000 MW at 100 m, in 2010, the height of newer turbines."
6392,13,indiana,6392,"By the end of 2011, Indiana had installed 1,340 MW of wind turbines."
6393,13,indiana,6393,Indianapolis International Airport serves the greater Indianapolis area.
6394,13,indiana,6394,"It opened in November 2008 and offers a midfield passenger terminal, concourses, air traffic control tower, parking garage, and airfield and apron improvements."
6395,13,indiana,6395,"Other major airports include Evansville Regional Airport, Fort Wayne International Airport (which houses the 122d Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard), and South Bend International Airport."
6396,13,indiana,6396,A long-standing proposal to turn Gary Chicago International Airport into Chicago's third major airport received a boost in early 2006 with the approval of $48 million in federal funding over the next ten years.
6397,13,indiana,6397,No airlines operate out of Terre Haute Regional Airport but it is used for private planes.
6398,13,indiana,6398,"Since 1954, the 181st Fighter Wing of the Indiana Air National Guard was stationed at there, but the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Proposal of 2005 stated the 181st would lose its fighter mission and F-16 aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility a general-aviation-only facility."
6399,13,indiana,6399,"Louisville International Airport, across the Ohio River in Louisville, Kentucky, serves southern Indiana, as does Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Kentucky."
6400,13,indiana,6400,"Many residents of Northwest Indiana, which is primarily in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, use Chicago's airports, O'Hare International Airport and Chicago Midway International Airport."
6401,13,indiana,6401,"The major US Interstate highways in Indiana are I-64, I-65, I-265, I-465, I-865, I-69, I-469, I-70, I-74, I-80, I-90, I-94, and I-275."
6402,13,indiana,6402,"The various highways intersecting in and around Indianapolis, along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America."
6403,13,indiana,6403,There are also many US routes and state highways maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
6404,13,indiana,6404,These are numbered according to the same convention as US
6405,13,indiana,6405,Highways.
6406,13,indiana,6406,Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number.
6407,13,indiana,6407,"For example, I-64 and Indiana State Road 64 both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another."
6408,13,indiana,6408,A $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway.
6409,13,indiana,6409,"The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking Evansville to Martinsville) now complete."
6410,13,indiana,6410,The sixth and final phase to Indianapolis is in planning.
6411,13,indiana,6411,"When complete, I-69 will traverse an additional 142 miles (229 km) through the state."
6412,13,indiana,6412,"Most Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the 9-1-1 system."
6413,13,indiana,6413,Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state.
6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415,"There are also counties in northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one."
6416,13,indiana,6416,"Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417,Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"Notably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e."
6420,13,indiana,6420,"Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.)"
6421,13,indiana,6421,"in alphabetical order for north–south roads and presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.)"
6422,13,indiana,6422,in alphabetical order for east–west roads.
6423,13,indiana,6423,There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka.
6424,13,indiana,6424,Hamilton County's east-west roads continue Indianapolis's numbered street system from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.
6425,13,indiana,6425,"Indiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway."
6426,13,indiana,6426,"Other Class I railroads in Indiana include the Canadian National Railway and Soo Line Railroad, a Canadian Pacific Railway subsidiary, as well as Amtrak."
6427,13,indiana,6427,"The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads."
6428,13,indiana,6428,"The South Shore Line is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to South Bend."
6429,13,indiana,6429,Indiana is implementing an extensive rail plan prepared in 2002 by the Parsons Corporation.
6430,13,indiana,6430,"Many recreational trails, such as the Monon Trail and Cardinal Greenway, have been created from abandoned rails routes."
6431,13,indiana,6431,"Indiana annually ships more than 70 million tons of cargo by water each year, which ranks 14th among all US states."
6432,13,indiana,6432,"More than half of Indiana's border is water, which includes 400 miles (640 km) of direct access to two major freight transportation arteries: the Great Lakes/St."
6433,13,indiana,6433,Lawrence Seaway (via Lake Michigan) and the Inland Waterway System (via the Ohio River).
6434,13,indiana,6434,"The Ports of Indiana manages three major ports which include Burns Harbor, Jeffersonville, and Mount Vernon."
6435,13,indiana,6435,"In Evansville, three public and several private port facilities receive year-round service from five major barge lines operating on the Ohio River."
6436,13,indiana,6436,Evansville has been a US Customs Port of Entry for more than 125 years.
6437,13,indiana,6437,"Because of this, it is possible to have international cargo shipped to Evansville in bond."
6438,13,indiana,6438,The international cargo can then clear Customs in Evansville rather than a coastal port.
6439,13,indiana,6439,Indiana's 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state-funded public school system.
6440,13,indiana,6440,It also allotted one township for a public university.
6441,13,indiana,6441,"However, the plan turned out to be far too idealistic for a pioneer society, as tax money was not accessible for its organization."
6442,13,indiana,6442,"In the 1840s, Caleb Mills pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution."
6443,13,indiana,6443,"In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of Union Literary Institute and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves."
6444,13,indiana,6444,"Although the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870."
6445,13,indiana,6445,"Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly ten percent attend private schools and parochial schools."
6446,13,indiana,6446,About half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.
6447,13,indiana,6447,Indiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history.
6448,13,indiana,6448,"Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state."
6449,13,indiana,6449,These new standards were adopted in April 2014.
6450,13,indiana,6450,The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.
6451,13,indiana,6451,State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools.
6452,13,indiana,6452,"Mathematics, English/Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies are among the top, prioritized standards."
6453,13,indiana,6453,"In 2017, the Indiana Department of Education reported that the state's overall graduation rates were 87.19% for waivered graduations and 80.10% for non-waiver graduations."
6454,13,indiana,6454,"The largest educational institution is Indiana University, the flagship campus of which was endorsed as Indiana Seminary in 1820."
6455,13,indiana,6455,Indiana State University was established as the state's Normal School in 1865
6456,13,indiana,6456,"The three other independent state universities are Vincennes University (Founded in 1801 by the Indiana Territory), Ball State University (1918) and University of Southern Indiana (1965 as ISU – Evansville)."
6457,13,indiana,6457,Many of Indiana's private colleges and universities are affiliated with religious groups.
6458,13,indiana,6458,"The University of Notre Dame, Marian University, and the University of Saint Francis are popular Roman Catholic schools."
6459,13,indiana,6459,"Universities affiliated with Protestant denominations include Anderson University, Butler University, Huntington University, Manchester University, Indiana Wesleyan University, Taylor University, Franklin College, Hanover College, DePauw University, Earlham College, Valparaiso University, University of Indianapolis, and University of Evansville."
6460,13,indiana,6460,"The state's community college system, Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, serves nearly 200,000 students annually, making it the state's largest public post-secondary educational institution and the nation's largest singly accredited statewide community college system."
6461,13,indiana,6461,"In 2008, the Indiana University system agreed to shift most of its associate (2-year) degrees to the Ivy Tech Community College System."
6462,13,indiana,6462,The state has several universities ranked among the best in 2013 rankings of the US News & World Report.
6463,13,indiana,6463,"The University of Notre Dame is ranked among the top 20, with Indiana University Bloomington and Purdue University ranking in the top 100."
6464,13,indiana,6464,Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) has recently made it into the top 200 US News & World Report rankings.
6465,13,indiana,6465,"Butler, Valparaiso, and the University of Evansville are ranked among the top ten in the Regional University Midwest Rankings."
6466,13,indiana,6466,Purdue's engineering programs are ranked eighth in the country.
6467,13,indiana,6467,"In addition, Taylor University is ranked first in the Regional College Midwest Rankings and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology has been considered the top Undergraduate Engineering school (where a doctorate is not offered) for 15 consecutive years."
6468,14,iowa,6468,"Iowa ( (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern United States, bordered by the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west."

6478,14,iowa,6478,Iowa is bordered by the Mississippi River on the east and the Missouri River and the Big Sioux River on the west.
6479,14,iowa,6479,"The northern boundary is a line along 43 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude."
6480,14,iowa,6480,"The southern border is the Des Moines River and a not-quite-straight line along approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north, as decided by the US Supreme Court in Missouri v. Iowa (1849) after a standoff between Missouri and Iowa known as the Honey War."
6481,14,iowa,6481,Iowa is the only state whose east and west borders are formed almost entirely by rivers.
6482,14,iowa,6482,"Carter Lake, Iowa, is the only city in the state located west of the Missouri River."
6483,14,iowa,6483,"Iowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two."
6484,14,iowa,6484,"The state capital, Des Moines, is in Polk County."

6503,14,iowa,6503,The explosion in the number of high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural water contamination and a decline in air quality.
6504,14,iowa,6504,"Other factors negatively affecting Iowa's environment include the extensive use of older coal-fired power plants, fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production, and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer."
6505,14,iowa,6505,Iowa has a humid continental climate throughout the state (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with extremes of both heat and cold.
6506,14,iowa,6506,"The average annual temperature at Des Moines is 50 °F (10 °C); for some locations in the north, such as Mason City, the figure is about 45 °F (7 °C), while Keokuk, on the Mississippi River, averages 52 °F (11 °C)."

6520,14,iowa,6520,"By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems."
6521,14,iowa,6521,This transformation happened gradually.
6522,14,iowa,6522,"During the Archaic period (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased."
6523,14,iowa,6523,"More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants."
6524,14,iowa,6524,"The subsequent Woodland period saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence."
6525,14,iowa,6525,During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.

6952,15,kansas,6952,The western third of the state—from roughly the US Route 83 corridor westward—has a semi-arid steppe climate.
6953,15,kansas,6953,"Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid."

6960,15,kansas,6960,"Routes 83 and 81, as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of US 50, reach 90 °F (32 °C) or above on most days of June, July, and August."
6961,15,kansas,6961,"High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the heat index into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, Hutchinson, Salina, Russell, Hays, and Great Bend."
6962,15,kansas,6962,"Temperatures are often higher in Dodge City, Garden City, and Liberal, but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature."
6963,15,kansas,6963,"Although temperatures of 100 °F (38 °C) or higher are not as common in areas east of US 81, higher humidity and the urban heat island effect lead most summer days to heat indices between 107 °F (42 °C) and 114 °F (46 °C) in Topeka, Lawrence, and the Kansas City metropolitan area."
6964,15,kansas,6964,"During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below 80 °F (27 °C)."

6970,15,kansas,6970,Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of California and Arizona.
6971,15,kansas,6971,"Kansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer."
6972,15,kansas,6972,"Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms."
6973,15,kansas,6973,"Some of these storms become supercell thunderstorms; these can produce some tornadoes, occasionally those of EF3 strength or higher."
6974,15,kansas,6974,Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.
6975,15,kansas,6975,Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large hail over Kansas as well.

6979,15,kansas,6979,"Kansas's record high of 121 °F (49.4 °C) ties with North Dakota for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California (134 °F or 56.7 °C), Arizona (128 °F or 53.3 °C), Nevada (125 °F or 51.7 °C), and New Mexico (122 °F or 50 °C)."

6981,15,kansas,6981,"This includes a natural increase since the last census of 93,899 (246,484 births minus 152,585 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 20,742 people out of the state."

6985,15,kansas,6985,"The focus on labor-efficient grain-based agriculture—such as a large wheat farm that requires only one or a few people with large machinery to operate, rather than a vegetable farm that requires many people—is causing the de-population of rural areas across Kansas."
6986,15,kansas,6986,"According to the 2010 United States Census, the racial makeup of the population was:"

6998,15,kansas,6998,"Kansas's capital Topeka is sometimes cited as the home of Pentecostalism as it was the site of Charles Fox Parham's Bethel Bible College, where glossolalia was first claimed as the evidence of a spiritual experience referred to as the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1901."

7014,15,kansas,7014,"The northeastern portion of the state, extending from the eastern border to Junction City and from the Nebraska border to south of Johnson County is home to more than 1.5 million people in the Kansas City (Kansas portion), Manhattan, Lawrence, and Topeka metropolitan areas."

7846,17,louisiana,7846,"In the post-Civil War environment, Anglo-Americans increased the pressure for Anglicization, and in 1921, English was for a time made the sole language of instruction in Louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was revived in 1974."
7847,17,louisiana,7847,"There has never been an official language in Louisiana, and the state constitution enumerates ""the right of the people to preserve, foster, and promote their respective historic, linguistic, and cultural origins""."
7848,17,louisiana,7848,"Like other states in the Deep South region, Louisiana frequently ranks low in terms of health, education, and development, and high in measures of poverty."
7849,17,louisiana,7849,"In 2018, Louisiana was ranked as the least healthy state in the country, with high levels of drug-related deaths and excessive alcohol consumption, while it has had the highest homicide rate in the United States since at least the 1990s."
7850,17,louisiana,7850,"Louisiana was named after Louis XIV, King of France from 1643 to 1715."
7851,17,louisiana,7851,"When René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle claimed the territory drained by the Mississippi River for France, he named it La Louisiane."
7852,17,louisiana,7852,"The suffix ‑ana (or ‑ane) is a Latin suffix that can refer to ""information relating to a particular individual, subject, or place""."
7853,17,louisiana,7853,"Thus, roughly, Louis + ana carries the idea of ""related to Louis""."
7854,17,louisiana,7854,"Once part of the French Colonial Empire, the Louisiana Territory stretched from present-day Mobile Bay to just north of the present-day Canada–United States border, including a small part of what is now the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan."
7855,17,louisiana,7855,Louisiana was inhabited by Native Americans for many millennia before the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century.
7856,17,louisiana,7856,"During the Middle Archaic period, Louisiana was the site of the earliest mound complex in North America and one of the earliest dated, complex constructions in the Americas, the Watson Brake site near present-day Monroe."
7857,17,louisiana,7857,"An 11-mound complex, it was built about 5400 BP (3500 BC)."
7858,17,louisiana,7858,"The Middle Archaic sites of Caney and Frenchman's Bend have also been securely dated to 5600–5000 BP (3700–3100 BC), demonstrating that seasonal hunter-gatherers organized to build complex earthwork constructions in present-day northern Louisiana."
7859,17,louisiana,7859,These discoveries overturned previous assumptions in archaeology that such complex mounds were built only by cultures of more settled peoples who were dependent on maize cultivation.
7860,17,louisiana,7860,"The Hedgepeth Site in Lincoln Parish is more recent, dated to 5200–4500 BP (3300–2600 BC)."
7861,17,louisiana,7861,"Nearly 2,000 years later, Poverty Point was built; it is the largest and best-known Late Archaic site in the state."
7862,17,louisiana,7862,The city of modern-day Epps developed near it.
7863,17,louisiana,7863,"The Poverty Point culture may have reached its peak around 1500 BC, making it the first complex culture, and possibly the first tribal culture in North America."
7864,17,louisiana,7864,It lasted until approximately 700 BC.
7865,17,louisiana,7865,"The Poverty Point culture was followed by the Tchefuncte and Lake Cormorant cultures of the Tchula period, local manifestations of Early Woodland period."
7866,17,louisiana,7866,The Tchefuncte culture were the first people in the area of Louisiana to make large amounts of pottery.
7867,17,louisiana,7867,These cultures lasted until AD 200.
7868,17,louisiana,7868,"The Middle Woodland period started in Louisiana with the Marksville culture in the southern and eastern part of the state, reaching across the Mississippi River to the east around Natchez and the Fourche Maline culture in the northwestern part of the state."
7869,17,louisiana,7869,The Marksville culture was named after the Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site in Avoyelles Parish.
7870,17,louisiana,7870,"These cultures were contemporaneous with the Hopewell cultures of present-day Ohio and Illinois, and participated in the Hopewell Exchange Network."
7871,17,louisiana,7871,Trade with peoples to the southwest brought the bow and arrow.
7872,17,louisiana,7872,The first burial mounds were built at this time.
7873,17,louisiana,7873,"Political power began to be consolidated, as the first platform mounds at ritual centers were constructed for the developing hereditary political and religious leadership."
7874,17,louisiana,7874,"By 400 the Late Woodland period had begun with the Baytown culture, Troyville culture, and Coastal Troyville during the Baytown Period and were succeeded by the Coles Creek cultures."
7875,17,louisiana,7875,"Where the Baytown peoples built dispersed settlements, the Troyville people instead continued building major earthwork centers."
7876,17,louisiana,7876,Population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity.
7877,17,louisiana,7877,Many Coles Creek sites were erected over earlier Woodland period mortuary mounds.
7878,17,louisiana,7878,Scholars have speculated that emerging elites were symbolically and physically appropriating dead ancestors to emphasize and project their own authority.
7879,17,louisiana,7879,"The Mississippian period in Louisiana was when the Plaquemine and the Caddoan Mississippian cultures developed, and the peoples adopted extensive maize agriculture, cultivating different strains of the plant by saving seeds, selecting for certain characteristics, etc."
7880,17,louisiana,7880,The Plaquemine culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana began in 1200 and continued to about 1600.
7881,17,louisiana,7881,"Examples in Louisiana include the Medora Site, the archaeological type site for the culture in West Baton Rouge Parish whose characteristics helped define the culture, the Atchafalaya Basin Mounds in St Mary Parish, the Fitzhugh Mounds in Madison Parish, the Scott Place Mounds in Union Parish, and the Sims Site in St Charles Parish."
7882,17,louisiana,7882,"Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture that is represented by its largest settlement, the Cahokia site in Illinois east of St. Louis, Missouri."
7883,17,louisiana,7883,"At its peak Cahokia is estimated to have had a population of more than 20,000."
7884,17,louisiana,7884,"The Plaquemine culture is considered ancestral to the historic Natchez and Taensa peoples, whose descendants encountered Europeans in the colonial era."
7885,17,louisiana,7885,"By 1000 in the northwestern part of the state, the Fourche Maline culture had evolved into the Caddoan Mississippian culture."
7886,17,louisiana,7886,"The Caddoan Mississippians occupied a large territory, including what is now eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, northeast Texas, and northwest Louisiana."
7887,17,louisiana,7887,Archaeological evidence has demonstrated that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present.
7888,17,louisiana,7888,The Caddo and related Caddo-language speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact were the direct ancestors of the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma of today.
7889,17,louisiana,7889,Significant Caddoan Mississippian archaeological sites in Louisiana include Belcher Mound Site in Caddo Parish and Gahagan Mounds Site in Red River Parish.
7890,17,louisiana,7890,"Many current place names in Louisiana, including Atchafalaya, Natchitouches (now spelled Natchitoches), Caddo, Houma, Tangipahoa, and Avoyel (as Avoyelles), are transliterations of those used in various Native American languages."
7891,17,louisiana,7891,The first European explorers to visit Louisiana came in 1528 when a Spanish expedition led by Pánfilo de Narváez located the mouth of the Mississippi River.
7892,17,louisiana,7892,"In 1542, Hernando de Soto's expedition skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and Tunica groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the Gulf of Mexico in 1543."
7893,17,louisiana,7893,Spanish interest in Louisiana faded away for a century and a half.
7894,17,louisiana,7894,"In the late 17th century, French and French Canadian expeditions, which included sovereign, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast."
7895,17,louisiana,7895,"With its first settlements, France laid claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada."
7896,17,louisiana,7896,"In 1682, the French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle named the region Louisiana to honor King Louis XIV of France."
7897,17,louisiana,7897,"The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at what is now Ocean Springs, Mississippi, near Biloxi), was founded in 1699 by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, a French military officer from Canada."
7898,17,louisiana,7898,"By then the French had also built a small fort at the mouth of the Mississippi at a settlement they named La Balise (or La Balize), ""seamark"" in French."
7899,17,louisiana,7899,By 1721 they built a 62-foot (19 m) wooden lighthouse-type structure here to guide ships on the river.
7900,17,louisiana,7900,A royal ordinance of 1722—following the Crown's transfer of the Illinois Country's governance from Canada to Louisiana—may have featured the broadest definition of Louisiana: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghenies.
7901,17,louisiana,7901,"A generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general Vaudreuil set the northern and eastern bounds of his domain as the Wabash valley up to the mouth of the Vermilion River (near present-day Danville, Illinois); from there, northwest to le Rocher on the Illinois River, and from there west to the mouth of the Rock River (at present day Rock Island, Illinois)."
7902,17,louisiana,7902,"Thus, Vincennes and Peoria were the limit of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near present-day Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana), and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada."
7903,17,louisiana,7903,"The settlement of Natchitoches (along the Red River in present-day northwest Louisiana) was established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana."
7904,17,louisiana,7904,"The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in Texas via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana."
7905,17,louisiana,7905,"The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves."
7906,17,louisiana,7906,"Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town."
7907,17,louisiana,7907,"This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane."
7908,17,louisiana,7908,"Louisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the Illinois Country, around present-day St. Louis, Missouri."
7909,17,louisiana,7909,The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.
7910,17,louisiana,7910,"Initially, Mobile and then Biloxi served as the capital of La Louisiane."
7911,17,louisiana,7911,"Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes."
7912,17,louisiana,7912,"From then until the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi."
7913,17,louisiana,7913,"In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the German Coast."
7914,17,louisiana,7914,"France ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War (generally referred to in North America as the French and Indian War)."
7915,17,louisiana,7915,"The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, had become a colony of Spain by the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)."
7916,17,louisiana,7916,The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.
7917,17,louisiana,7917,"In 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of Acadia (now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been expelled from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War."
7918,17,louisiana,7918,They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called Acadiana.
7919,17,louisiana,7919,"The governor Luis de Unzaga y Amézaga, eager to gain more settlers, welcomed the Acadian refugees, the ancestors of Louisiana's Cajuns."
7920,17,louisiana,7920,"Spanish Canary Islanders, called Isleños, emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783."
7921,17,louisiana,7921,"In 1800, France's Napoleon Bonaparte reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, an arrangement kept secret for two years."
7922,17,louisiana,7922,"Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies."
7923,17,louisiana,7923,"In 1709, French financier Antoine Crozat obtained a monopoly of commerce in La Louisiane, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico to what is now Illinois."
7924,17,louisiana,7924,"""That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year,"" the British historian Hugh Thomas wrote."
7925,17,louisiana,7925,"Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves."
7926,17,louisiana,7926,"Starting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the Du Maine and the Aurore, arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa."
7927,17,louisiana,7927,Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724, the French government issued a law called the Code Noir (""Black Code"" in English) which ""regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed ""interracial"" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted manumission, outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar."
7933,17,louisiana,7933,"Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935,Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves."
7937,17,louisiana,7937,"During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938,"Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939,They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941,"On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern Thirteen Colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"Fugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maroon"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", meaning ""fugitive cattle""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"In the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946,"When the United States purchased Louisiana in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring Mississippi, though it violated US law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947,"Despite demands by United States Rep. James Hillhouse and by the pamphleteer Thomas Paine to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"At the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949,It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations.
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers ""cannot be had in this unhealthy climate""."
7951,17,louisiana,7951,"Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the US and Great Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade—the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"By 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,"New Orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation."
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"During the decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved African Americans underwent forced migration from the Upper South to the Deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957,Others were transported by their owners as slaveholders moved west for new lands.
7958,17,louisiana,7958,"With changing agriculture in the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959,Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South.
7960,17,louisiana,7960,Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the coastwise slave trade.
7961,17,louisiana,7961,"After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963,"Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from Saint-Domingue, following a slave rebellion that started in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, free people of color, and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965,"They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The process of gaining independence in Saint-Domingue was complex, but uprisings continued."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803, France pulled out its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two-thirds sent to the island two years before, mostly to yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic in the western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, achieved by slave leaders."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) said: ""Saint-Domingue was, of all our colonies in the Antilles, the one whose mentality and customs influenced Louisiana the most."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970,"When the United States won its independence from Great Britain in 1783, one of its major concerns was having a European power on its western boundary, and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachian Mountains provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship produce was to use a flatboat to float it down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974,Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the Caribbean sugar trade.
7975,17,louisiana,7975,"By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe to the French."
7976,17,louisiana,7976,"Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to US settlement."
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.When the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979,"With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to US commerce at any time."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, US Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for US commerce."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded.
7986,17,louisiana,7986,"Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987,"President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed James Monroe a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989,"However, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the entirety of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for sixty million Francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,"Part of this sum, $3.5 million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States."
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in United States bonds, which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of Hope and Company, and the British banking house of Baring, at a discount of ​87 1⁄2 per each $100 unit."
7994,17,louisiana,7994,"As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"English banker Alexander Baring conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money—which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country."
7996,17,louisiana,7996,"When news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,"He had authorized the expenditure of $10 million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a land package which would double the size of the country."
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents in the Federalist Party argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or negotiating treaties without the consent of the Senatorte."
7999,17,louisiana,7999,"What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000,"President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty."
8001,17,louisiana,8001,"Despite Federalist objections, the US Senatorte ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002,"By statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance."
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004,"Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,"The following day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States."
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony was held in St. Louis on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The following day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the First US"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole.
8009,17,louisiana,8009,"The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010,"The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012,"Shortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the Territory of Orleans to the south and the District of Louisiana (subsequently formed as the Louisiana Territory) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013,"Louisiana became the eighteenth US state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the Missouri Territory."
8014,17,louisiana,8014,"An area known as the Florida Parishes was soon annexed into the state of Louisiana on April 14, 1812."
8015,17,louisiana,8015,"From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against Whigs, then Know Nothings, and finally only other Democrats."
8016,17,louisiana,8016,"According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, nearly 47% of the state's total population of 708,002."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,"The strong economic interest of elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to secede from the Union on January 26, 1861."
8018,17,louisiana,8018,It followed other Southern states in seceding after the election of Abraham Lincoln as president of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019,"Louisiana's secession was announced on January 26, 1861, and it became part of the Confederate States of America."
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated in the Civil War, a result of Union strategy to cut the Confederacy in two by seizing the Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,"Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862."
8022,17,louisiana,8022,"Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives to the US Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023,"Following the Civil War and emancipation of slaves, violence rose in the South as the war was carried on by insurgent private and paramilitary groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024,"Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate freedmen and generally refused to give the vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025,They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.)
8026,17,louisiana,8026,"Following the Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans riot the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen."
8027,17,louisiana,8027,"Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,It was grouped with Texas in what was administered as the Fifth Military District.
8029,17,louisiana,8029,African Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030,"Both freedmen and people of color who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in Ku Klux Klan chapters."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"By 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034,"Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect was immediate and long lasting.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"The state population in 1900 was 47% African-American: a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038,"Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of free people of color before the Civil War."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"By 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after congressional passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,The boll weevil infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046,"Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went West to California for jobs in its expanding defense industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047,"During some of the Great Depression, Louisiana was led by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected to office on populist appeal.
8049,17,louisiana,8049,"His public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased suffrage for poor whites, but Long was criticized for his allegedly demogogic and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana's state government.
8051,17,louisiana,8051,Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule ended abruptly when he was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,Mobilization for World War II created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,"But thousands of other workers, black and white alike, migrated to California for better jobs in its burgeoning defense industry."
8055,17,louisiana,8055,"Many African Americans left the state in the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s through the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers.
8057,17,louisiana,8057,"They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living in communities where they could vote."
8058,17,louisiana,8058,"On November 26, 1958, at Chennault Air Force Base, a USAF B-47 bomber with a nuclear weapon on board developed a fire while on the ground."
8059,17,louisiana,8059,The aircraft wreckage and the site of the accident were contaminated after a limited explosion of non-nuclear material.
8060,17,louisiana,8060,In the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration.
8061,17,louisiana,8061,"Despite opposition by the States Rights Party, downstate black voters had begun to increase their rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes."
8062,17,louisiana,8062,"In 1960 the state established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission, to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation."
8063,17,louisiana,8063,"Despite this, gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20% and more, and it was 32% by 1964, when the first national civil rights legislation of the era was passed."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"The percentage of black voters ranged widely in the state during these years, from 93.8% in Evangeline Parish to 1.7% in Tensas Parish, for instance, where there were white efforts to suppress the vote in the black-majority parish."
8065,17,louisiana,8065,"Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill towns were catalysts to the founding of the first two chapters of the Deacons for Defense and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa, respectively."
8066,17,louisiana,8066,"Made up of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, they were armed self-defense groups established to protect activists and their families."
8067,17,louisiana,8067,"Continued violent white resistance in Bogalusa to blacks trying to use public facilities in 1965, following passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, caused the federal government to order local police to protect the activists."
8068,17,louisiana,8068,"Other chapters were formed in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama."
8069,17,louisiana,8069,By 1960 the proportion of African Americans in Louisiana had dropped to 32%.
8070,17,louisiana,8070,"The 1,039,207 black citizens were still suppressed by segregation and disfranchisement."
8071,17,louisiana,8071,African Americans continued to suffer disproportionate discriminatory application of the state's voter registration rules.
8072,17,louisiana,8072,"Because of better opportunities elsewhere, from 1965 to 1970, blacks continued to migrate out of Louisiana, for a net loss of more than 37,000 people."
8073,17,louisiana,8073,"Based on official census figures, the African American population in 1970 stood at 1,085,109, a net gain of more than 46,000 people compared to 1960."
8074,17,louisiana,8074,"During the latter period, some people began to migrate to cities of the New South for opportunities."
8075,17,louisiana,8075,"Since that period, blacks entered the political system and began to be elected to office, as well as having other opportunities."
8076,17,louisiana,8076,"On May 21, 1919, the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, giving women full rights to vote, was passed at a national level, and was made the law throughout the United States on August 18, 1920."
8077,17,louisiana,8077,"Louisiana finally ratified the amendment on June 11, 1970."
8078,17,louisiana,8078,"Due to its location on the Gulf Coast, Louisiana has regularly suffered the effects of tropical storms and damaging hurricanes."
8079,17,louisiana,8079,"On August 29, 2005, New Orleans and many other low-lying parts of the state along the Gulf of Mexico were hit by the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina."
8080,17,louisiana,8080,It caused widespread damage due to breaching of levees and large-scale flooding of more than 80% of the city.
8081,17,louisiana,8081,"Officials had issued warnings to evacuate the city and nearby areas, but tens of thousands of people, mostly African Americans, stayed behind, many of them stranded."
8082,17,louisiana,8082,Many people died and survivors suffered through the damage of the widespread floodwaters.
8083,17,louisiana,8083,In July 2016 the shooting of Alton Sterling sparked protests throughout the state capital of Baton Rouge.
8084,17,louisiana,8084,"In August 2016, an unnamed storm dumped trillions of gallons of rain on southern Louisiana, including the cities of Denham Springs, Baton Rouge, Gonzales, St. Amant and Lafayette, causing catastrophic flooding."
8085,17,louisiana,8085,"An estimated 110,000 homes were damaged and thousands of residents were displaced."
8086,17,louisiana,8086,"In 2019, three Louisiana black churches were set on fire."
8087,17,louisiana,8087,"The suspect used gasoline, destroying each church completely."
8088,17,louisiana,8088,"Holden Matthews, 21 years old, was charged with the destruction of the churches."
8089,17,louisiana,8089,"The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was announced on March 9, 2020."
8090,17,louisiana,8090,"Since the first confirmed case as of October 27, 2020, there had been 180,069 confirmed cases; 5,854 people have died of COVID-19."
8091,17,louisiana,8091,Louisiana entered phase one of re-opening the state on May 15.
8092,17,louisiana,8092,"On June 4, Governor John Bel Edwards signed an order moving to phase two."
8093,17,louisiana,8093,Gov.
8094,17,louisiana,8094,"Edwards extended phase two until September 11, and phase three began with speculation on October 9."
8095,17,louisiana,8095,Louisiana is bordered to the west by Texas
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The state may properly be divided into two parts, the uplands of the north, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and barrier islands that cover about 20,000 square miles (52,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098,"This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River, which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about 600 mi (970 km) and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the Red River; the Ouachita River and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is 10–60 miles (15–100 km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15 km) across."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a levee), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103,They consist of prairie and woodlands.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3 m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50–60 feet (15–18 m) at the prairie and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to Driskill Mountain, the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106,"From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) spends around $1 billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana shoreline and land in both federal and state funding.
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"Besides the waterways already named, there are the Sabine, forming the western boundary; and the Pearl, the eastern boundary; the Calcasieu, the Mermentau, the Vermilion, Bayou Teche, the Atchafalaya, the Boeuf, Bayou Lafourche, the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, the Macon River, the Tensas, Amite River, the Tchefuncte, the Tickfaw, the Natalbany River, and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over 4,000 miles (6,400 km) long."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately 3-mile (4.8 km)-wide portion of subsea land of the inner continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110,"Through a peculiarity of the political geography of the United States, this is substantially less than the 9-mile (14 km)-wide jurisdiction of nearby states Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have extensive Gulf coastlines."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is among the fastest-disappearing areas in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112,This has largely resulted from human mismanagement of the coast (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one time, the land was added to when spring floods from the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated marsh growth; the land is now shrinking."
8114,17,louisiana,8114,There are multiple causes.
8115,17,louisiana,8115,Artificial levees block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119,Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120,"There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121,"Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as the communities disappear, more and more people are leaving the region."
8123,17,louisiana,8123,"Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,The Gulf of Mexico 'dead zone' off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"It was 8,776 square miles (22,730 km2) in 2017, the largest ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico did not exist 250 million years ago when there was but one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As Pangea split apart, the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico opened."
8128,17,louisiana,8128,"Louisiana slowly developed, over millions of years, from water into land, and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,"The oldest rocks are exposed in the north, in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest."
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date back to the early Cenozoic Era, some 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,The history of the formation of these rocks can be found in D. Spearing's Roadside Geology of Louisiana.
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest parts of the state were formed during the last 12,000 years as successive deltas of the Mississippi River: the Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, the modern Mississippi, and now the Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133,The sediments were carried from north to south by the Mississippi River.
8134,17,louisiana,8134,"In between the Tertiary rocks of the north, and the relatively new sediments along the coast, is a vast belt known as the Pleistocene Terraces."
8135,17,louisiana,8135,Their age and distribution can be largely related to the rise and fall of sea levels during past ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels, while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter."
8137,17,louisiana,8137,Salt domes are also found in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138,Their origin can be traced back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean had high rates of evaporation.
8139,17,louisiana,8139,"There are several hundred salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140,Salt domes are important not only as a source of salt
8141,17,louisiana,8141,"Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long, hot, humid summers and short, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its farthest point is no more than 200 mi (320 km) away."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's wet season."
8144,17,louisiana,8144,There is a dip in precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging 90 °F (32 °C) or more, and overnight lows averaging above 70 °F (21 °C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148,"At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with dew points in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over 120 °F (49 °C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies."
8150,17,louisiana,8150,"Temperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66 °F (19 °C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging 59 °F (15 °C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152,"The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with 46 °F (8 °C) the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37 °F (3 °C) in the winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153,"On occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154,Low temperatures near 20 °F (−7 °C) occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state.
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is 114 °F (46 °C) in Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is −16 °F (−27 °C) at Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157,"Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to strikes by major hurricanes, particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161,Louisiana averages 27 tornadoes annually.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state."
8163,17,louisiana,8163,"Tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the state, and from February through March in the northern part of the state."
8164,17,louisiana,8164,"Owing to its location and geology, the state has high biological diversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165,"Some vital areas, such as southwestern prairie, have experienced a loss in excess of 98 percent."
8166,17,louisiana,8166,"The pine flatwoods are also at great risk, mostly from fire suppression and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167,There is not yet a properly organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168,"Such a system would consist of a protected system of core areas linked by biological corridors, such as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169,"Louisiana contains a number of areas which, to varying degrees, prevent people from using them."
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to National Park Service areas and a United States National Forest, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, one state preservation area, one state forest, and many Wildlife Management Areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of Louisiana's largest government-owned areas is Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172,"It is some 600,000 acres in area, more than half of which is flatwoods vegetation, which supports many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173,These include the Louisiana pinesnake and red-cockaded woodpecker.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The system of government-owned cypress swamps around Lake Pontchartrain is another large area, with southern wetland species including egrets, alligators, and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 core areas would be needed to build a ""protected areas system"" for the state; these would range from southwestern prairies, to the Pearl River Floodplain in the east, to the Mississippi River alluvial swamps in the north."

8258,17,louisiana,8258,"Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02)."

8260,17,louisiana,8260,Louisiana is rich in petroleum and natural gas.

8268,17,louisiana,8268,"The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and refining, have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s."

8270,17,louisiana,8270,"Interior Department, in efforts by the federal government to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights."

8272,17,louisiana,8272,"When petroleum and gas boomed in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy."
8273,17,louisiana,8273,The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries.
8274,17,louisiana,8274,"For example, in the 1970s over 40 percent of Louisiana's state revenues came directly from severance taxes and mineral royalties."
8275,17,louisiana,8275,"Since the 1980s, these industries' headquarters have consolidated in Houston, but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the US Gulf of Mexico crude-oil-and-gas industry remain in Louisiana."
8276,17,louisiana,8276,"While the energy industry is still an important component of Louisiana's economy, the composition of this industry has changed dramatically over time."
8277,17,louisiana,8277,As of 2019 the refining and chemical manufacturing sector employs more people in Louisiana than the up-stream oil and gas extraction sector.
8278,17,louisiana,8278,"Louisiana is home to many, especially notable are the distinct culture of the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of color, descendants of free mixed-race families of the colonial and early statehood periods."
8279,17,louisiana,8279,The French colony of La Louisiane struggled for decades to survive.
8280,17,louisiana,8280,"Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281,Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As described by historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285,"This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in Saint-Domingue were from Africa than in the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286,"They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word crioulo; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289,"The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word ""Creole"", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of Creoles of Color (gens de couleur libres), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.)"
8292,17,louisiana,8292,"Often the French would free their concubines and mixed-race children, and pass on social capital to them."
8293,17,louisiana,8293,"They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294,They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295,The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education
8296,17,louisiana,8296,Many became artisans and property owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""Creole"" became associated with this class of Creoles of Color, many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,Wealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"The ancestors of Cajuns immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, known originally as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301,"After the British defeated France in the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304,"Some, who escaped the British, remained in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305,"Others scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306,Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around Lafayette and the LaFourche Bayou country.
8307,17,louisiana,8307,"They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309,"Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered somewhat derogatory."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isleños.
8311,17,louisiana,8311,"Its members are descendants of colonists from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as Frenchman, Acadians, Creoles, Spaniards, and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, the Isleños originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313,"Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century.
8315,17,louisiana,8315,"This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Through the centuries, the various Isleño communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317,Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana.
8318,17,louisiana,8318,The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.
8319,17,louisiana,8319,"According to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among persons five years old and older, 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% speak French (standard French, French Creole, or Cajun French), 3.30% speak Spanish, and 0.59% speak Vietnamese."
8320,17,louisiana,8320,"Historically, Native American peoples in the area at the time of European encounter were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa, and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321,"Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322,"Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east."
8323,17,louisiana,8323,"Among these were Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples."
8324,17,louisiana,8324,"Starting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans."
8325,17,louisiana,8325,They established French culture and language institutions.
8326,17,louisiana,8326,"They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French."
8329,17,louisiana,8329,"During the 19th century after the Louisiana Purchase by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers."
8330,17,louisiana,8330,Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private.
8331,17,louisiana,8331,Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French.
8332,17,louisiana,8332,"The State Constitution of 1812 gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread."
8333,17,louisiana,8333,Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The 1868 constitution, passed during the Reconstruction era before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335,"Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-Civil War prominence."
8336,17,louisiana,8336,"Several unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana."
8337,17,louisiana,8337,Dialects of the French language are: Colonial French and Houma French.
8338,17,louisiana,8338,Louisiana Creole French is the term for one of the Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339,"Two unique dialects developed of the English language: Louisiana English, a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as Yat, which resembles the New York City dialect sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340,"Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341,Colonial French was the dominant language of white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed Louisiana Creole, with a base in West African languages."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings."

8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations."

8360,17,louisiana,8360,"Danielle Dreilinger of The Times Picayune wrote in 2014 that ""Louisiana parents have a national reputation for favoring private schools."""
8361,17,louisiana,8361,"The number of students in enrolled in private schools in Louisiana declined by 9% from circa 2000-2005 until 2014, due to the proliferation of charter schools, the 2008 recession and Hurricane Katrina."
8362,17,louisiana,8362,Ten parishes in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans area had a combined 17% decline in private school enrollment in that period.
8363,17,louisiana,8363,This prompted private schools to lobby for school vouchers.

8386,17,louisiana,8386,"This include mayor–council, council–manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others."
8387,17,louisiana,8387,The Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance.
8388,17,louisiana,8388,"One is the use of the term ""parish"" (from the French: paroisse) in place of ""county"" for administrative subdivision."
8389,17,louisiana,8389,"Another is the legal system of civil law based on French, German, and Spanish legal codes and ultimately Roman law, as opposed to English common law."

8392,17,louisiana,8392,"Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803."

8394,17,louisiana,8394,Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other US states.
8395,17,louisiana,8395,"While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition, the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law."
8396,17,louisiana,8396,"Thus property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are still based mostly on traditional Roman legal thinking."
8397,17,louisiana,8397,"In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a covenant marriage."
8398,17,louisiana,8398,"In a covenant marriage, the couple waives their right to a ""no-fault"" divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage."

8400,17,louisiana,8400,"Marriages between ascendants and descendants, and marriages between collaterals within the fourth degree (i.e., siblings, aunt and nephew, uncle and niece, first cousins) are prohibited."

8404,17,louisiana,8404,"From 1898 to 1965, a period when Louisiana had effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites by provisions of a new constitution, this was essentially a one-party state dominated by white Democrats."

8407,17,louisiana,8407,"The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
8408,17,louisiana,8408,"Since the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President Lyndon Johnson to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party."

8414,17,louisiana,8414,"If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later."
8415,17,louisiana,8415,"This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican."
8416,17,louisiana,8416,Congressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system.
8417,17,louisiana,8417,"All other states (except Washington, California, and Maine) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a plurality voting system or runoff voting, to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials."
8418,17,louisiana,8418,"Between 2008 and 2010, federal congressional elections were run under a closed primary system—limited to registered party members."

8483,18,maine,8483,"There is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name ""Maine"", but the most likely is that early explorers named it after the former province of Maine in France."

8492,18,maine,8492,"Maine historians quoted this until the 1845 biography of that queen by Agnes Strickland established that she had no connection to the province; further, King Charles I married Henrietta Maria in 1625, three years after the name Maine first appeared on the charter."
8493,18,maine,8493,"A new theory put forward by Carol B. Smith Fisher in 2002 postulated that Sir Ferdinando Gorges chose the name in 1622 to honor the village where his ancestors first lived in England, rather than the province in France."

8989,19,maryland,8989,"Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state."

9449,20,massachusetts,9449,The concept of Mass Save was created in 2008 by the passing of the Green Communities Act of 2008 during Deval Patrick’s tenure as governor.
9450,20,massachusetts,9450,"The main goal of the Green Communities Act was to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in the State and to encourage new, more efficient technologies."
9451,20,massachusetts,9451,"Among others, one result of this act was a requirement for Program Administrators of utilities to invest in saving energy, as opposed to purchasing and generating additional energy where economically feasible."
9452,20,massachusetts,9452,"In Massachusetts, eleven Program Administrators, including NSTAR, National Grid, Western Massachusetts Electric, Cape Light Compact, Until, and Berkshire Gas, jointly own the rights to this program, in conjunction with the MA Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC)."
9453,20,massachusetts,9453,"Mass Save also conducts no-cost in-home energy assessments so that homeowners, renters, and small business owners may educate themselves about energy efficiency-related home improvements and find opportunities to save money and energy."

9460,20,massachusetts,9460,"In addition to the Federal Residential Renewable energy credit, Massachusetts residents may be eligible for a tax credit of up to 15 percent of the project."
9461,20,massachusetts,9461,"Once installed, arrays are eligible for net metering."
9462,20,massachusetts,9462,"Certain municipalities will offer up to $1.20 per watt, up to 50 percent of the system’s cost on PV arrays 25 kW or less."
9463,20,massachusetts,9463,"The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources also offers low-interest, fixed-rate financing with loan support for low-income residents."
9464,20,massachusetts,9464,"This program is currently set to terminate on December 31, 2020."
9465,20,massachusetts,9465,"As a part of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources’ effort to incentivize the usage of renewable energy, the MOR-EV, or Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles initiative was created."
9466,20,massachusetts,9466,"With this incentive, residents may qualify for a State incentive of up to $2,500 dollars for the purchase or lease of an electric vehicle, or $1,500 for the purchase or lease of a plug-in hybrid vehicle."
9467,20,massachusetts,9467,This rebate is available in addition to the tax credits offered by the United States Department of Energy for the purchase of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
9468,20,massachusetts,9468,"For income-eligible residents, Mass Save has partnered with Massachusetts Community Action Program Agencies and Low-Income Energy Affordability Network (LEAN) to offer residents assistance with upgrades to their homes that will result in more efficient energy usage."
9469,20,massachusetts,9469,"Residents may qualify for a replacement of their heating system, insulation installation, appliances, and thermostats if they meet the income qualifications provided on Mass Save’s website."
9470,20,massachusetts,9470,"For residents of 5+ family residential buildings, there are additional income-restricted benefits available through LEAN."
9471,20,massachusetts,9471,"If at least 50 percent of the residents of the building qualify as low income, energy efficiency improvements like those available through Mass Save are available."
9472,20,massachusetts,9472,"Residential structures operated by non-profit organizations, for profit operations, or housing authorities may take advantage of these programs."
9473,20,massachusetts,9473,"In late 2020, the Baker Administration released a Decarbonization Roadmap that aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050."
9474,20,massachusetts,9474,The plan calls for major investments in offshore wind and solar energy and would require all new automobiles sold to be zero-emissions (electric or hydrogen powered) by 2035.
9475,20,massachusetts,9475,"The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Massachusetts was 6,892,503 on July 1, 2019, a 5.27% increase since the 2010 United States Census."

9483,20,massachusetts,9483,Population growth was largely due to a relatively high quality of life and a large higher education system in the state.
9484,20,massachusetts,9484,"Foreign immigration is also a factor in the state's population growth, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower)."
9485,20,massachusetts,9485,"40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder from Asia."

9983,21,michigan,9983,"Ironwood, in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies 630 miles (1,010 kilometers) by highway from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern corner."
9984,21,michigan,9984,The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's political and population centers makes the U.P.
9985,21,michigan,9985,culturally and economically distinct.

10743,23,mississippi,10743,"Due to seasonal flooding, possible from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744,"The river's flooding created natural levees, which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops."
10745,23,mississippi,10745,Temporary workers built levees along the Mississippi River on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded.
10746,23,mississippi,10746,"From 1858 to 1861, the state took over levee building, accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work."
10748,23,mississippi,10748,Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749,Many of the Irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established.
10750,23,mississippi,10750,"Before the American Civil War, the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached twenty feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751,"Flooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753,"After the Civil War, major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754,"Such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those constructed after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties."
10756,23,mississippi,10756,"In 1879, the United States Congress created the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees."
10757,23,mississippi,10757,Both white and black transient workers were hired to build the levees in the late 19th century.
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"By 1882, levees averaged seven feet in height, but many in the southern Delta were severely tested by the flood that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759,"After the 1882 flood, the levee system was expanded."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee District was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern Delta counties; also included were some counties in Arkansas which were part of the Delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761,"Flooding overwhelmed northwestern Mississippi in 1912–1913, causing heavy damage to the levee districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,"Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts, on a scale of 2:1."
10763,23,mississippi,10763,"Although US participation in World War I interrupted funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764,Scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The region was severely damaged due to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which broke through the levees."
10766,23,mississippi,10766,"There were losses of millions of dollars in property, stock and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The most damage occurred in the lower Delta, including Washington and Bolivar counties."
10768,23,mississippi,10768,"Even as scientific knowledge about the Mississippi River has grown, upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769,Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770,"Such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, strengthening the river's current."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772,"Near 10,000 BC Native Americans or Paleo-Indians arrived in what today is referred to as the American South."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,Paleo-Indians in the South were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that became extinct following the end of the Pleistocene age.
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Native American settlements and agricultural fields were developed on the natural levees, higher ground in the proximity of rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Native Americans developed extensive fields near their permanent villages.
10776,23,mississippi,10776,"Together with other practices, they created some localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777,"After thousands of years, succeeding cultures of the Woodland and Mississippian culture eras developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which surplus supported the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778,Both were mound builder cultures.
10779,23,mississippi,10779,"Those of the Mississippian culture were the largest and most complex, constructed beginning about 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,The peoples had a trading network spanning the continent from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast.
10781,23,mississippi,10781,"Their large earthworks, which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts, still stand throughout the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys."
10782,23,mississippi,10782,Descendant Native American tribes of the Mississippian culture in the Southeast include the Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783,"Other tribes who inhabited the territory of Mississippi (and whose names were honored by colonists in local towns) include the Natchez, the Yazoo, and the Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, Hernando de Soto, who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French colonists established the first European settlement at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built in the vicinity of present-day Ocean Springs on the Gulf Coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was settled by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,"In 1716, the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (as Fort Rosalie); it became the dominant town and trading post of the area."
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the greater territory ""New France""; the Spanish continued to claim part of the Gulf coast area (east of Mobile Bay) of present-day southern Alabama, in addition to the entire area of present-day Florida."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"Through the 18th century, the area was ruled variously by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,The colonists imported African slaves as laborers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791,"Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of free people of color (gens de couleur libres), mostly multiracial descendants of European men and enslaved or free black women, and their mixed-race children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men.
10793,23,mississippi,10793,"Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), both before and after marriages to European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settled property on them; they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of plaçage."
10795,23,mississippi,10795,"With this social capital, the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796,"After Great Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797,"They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798,"After the Peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish rule as part of West Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819 the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all of East Florida in the Adams–Onís Treaty, and in 1822 both were merged into the Florida Territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800,"After the American Revolution (1765–83), Britain ceded this area to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801,"The Mississippi Territory was organized on April 7, 1798, from territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States."
10802,23,mississippi,10802,Their original colonial charters theoretically extended west to the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803,The Mississippi Territory was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain.
10804,23,mississippi,10804,"From 1800 to about 1830, the United States purchased some lands (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mostly migrants from other Southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were exhausted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,"New settlers kept encroaching on Choctaw land, and they pressed the federal government to expel the Native Americans."
10807,23,mississippi,10807,"On September 27, 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the US Government and the Choctaw."
10808,23,mississippi,10808,"The Choctaw agreed to sell their traditional homelands in Mississippi and Alabama, for compensation and removal to reservations in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma)."
10809,23,mississippi,10809,This opened up land for sale to European-American migrant settlement.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the states to become US citizens, as they were considered to be giving up their tribal membership."
10811,23,mississippi,10811,"They were the second major Native American ethnic group to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas during rather than join the removal)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812,"Today their descendants include approximately 9,500 persons identifying as Choctaw, who live in Neshoba, Newton, Leake, and Jones counties."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians reorganized in the 20th century and is a Federally recognized tribe.
10814,23,mississippi,10814,"Many slaveholders brought enslaved African Americans with them or purchased them through the domestic slave trade, especially in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"Through the trade, an estimated nearly one million slaves were forcibly transported to the Deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke up many slave families of the Upper South, where planters were selling excess slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816,The Southerners imposed slave laws in the Deep South and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817,"Beginning in 1822, slaves in Mississippi were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishment by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,The Southern slave codes made the willful killing of a slave illegal in most cases.
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, the 1860 Mississippi case of Oliver v. State charged the defendant with murdering his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820,"Mississippi became the 20th state on December 10, 1817."
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes was the first governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as ancestral land by several Native American tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek, and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823,"Plantations were developed primarily along the major rivers, where the waterfront provided access to the major transportation routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"This is also where early towns developed, linked by the steamboats that carried commercial products and crops to markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The remainder of Native American ancestral land remained largely undeveloped but was sold through treaties until 1826, when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826,"The combination of the Mississippi state legislature's abolition of Choctaw Tribal Government in 1829, President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act and the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek of 1830, the Choctaw were effectively forced to sell their land and were transported to Oklahoma Territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, together with other southeastern tribes removed as a result of the Act, became known as the Trail of Tears."
10828,23,mississippi,10828,"When cotton was king during the 1850s, Mississippi plantation owners—especially those of the Delta and Black Belt central regions—became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market, and free labor gained through their holding enslaved African Americans."
10829,23,mississippi,10829,They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830,"The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for secession."
10831,23,mississippi,10831,"Mississippi was a slave society, with the economy dependent on slavery."
10832,23,mississippi,10832,"The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns."
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"By 1860, the enslaved African-American population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the state's total of 791,305 persons."
10834,23,mississippi,10834,Fewer than 1000 were free people of color.
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively low population of the state before the Civil War reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the riverfronts, which formed the main transportation corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836,Ninety percent of the Delta bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The state needed many more settlers for development.
10838,23,mississippi,10838,The land further away from the rivers was cleared by freedmen and white migrants during Reconstruction and later.
10839,23,mississippi,10839,"On January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union, and it was one of the founding members of the Confederate States."
10840,23,mississippi,10840,The first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves.
10841,23,mississippi,10841,"During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce."
10842,23,mississippi,10842,"More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the Civil War, and casualties were extremely heavy."
10843,23,mississippi,10843,Union General Ulysses S. Grant's long siege of Vicksburg finally gained the Union control of the river in 1863.
10844,23,mississippi,10844,"In the postwar period, freedmen withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations."
10845,23,mississippi,10845,"The majority of blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, sharply reducing its membership."
10846,23,mississippi,10846,They created independent black Baptist congregations.
10847,23,mississippi,10847,By 1895 they had established numerous black Baptist state associations and the National Baptist Convention of black churches.
10848,23,mississippi,10848,"In addition, independent black denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church (established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 19th century) and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (established in New York City), sent missionaries to the South in the postwar years."
10849,23,mississippi,10849,They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South.
10850,23,mississippi,10850,Southern congregations brought their own influences to those denominations as well.
10851,23,mississippi,10851,"During Reconstruction, the first Mississippi constitutional convention in 1868, with delegates both black and white, framed a constitution whose major elements would be maintained for 22 years."
10852,23,mississippi,10852,"The convention was the first political organization in the state to include African-American representatives, 17 among the 100 members (32 counties had black majorities at the time)."
10853,23,mississippi,10853,"Some among the black delegates were freedmen, but others were educated free blacks who had migrated from the North."
10854,23,mississippi,10854,"The convention adopted universal suffrage; did away with property qualifications for suffrage or for office, a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel."
10855,23,mississippi,10855,"Under the terms of Reconstruction, Mississippi was restored to the Union on February 23, 1870."
10856,23,mississippi,10856,"Because the Mississippi Delta contained so much fertile bottomland that had not been developed before the Civil War, 90 percent of the land was still frontier."
10857,23,mississippi,10857,"After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land."
10858,23,mississippi,10858,"In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and selling timber, and eventually advance to ownership."
10859,23,mississippi,10859,"The new farmers included many freedmen, who by the late 19th century achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands."
10860,23,mississippi,10860,"In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership."
10861,23,mississippi,10861,"Around the start of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were African American."
10862,23,mississippi,10862,But many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century.
10863,23,mississippi,10863,Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War.
10864,23,mississippi,10864,"As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by hard, personal labor."
10865,23,mississippi,10865,"Democrats had regained control of the state legislature in 1875, after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the ""white line"" campaign, based on asserting white supremacy."
10866,23,mississippi,10866,Democratic whites were well armed and formed paramilitary organizations such as the Red Shirts to suppress black voting.
10867,23,mississippi,10867,"From 1874 to the elections of 1875, they pressured whites to join the Democrats, and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known ""riots"" in cities around the state to intimidate blacks."
10868,23,mississippi,10868,"They killed a total of 150 blacks, although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many."
10869,23,mississippi,10869,A total of three white Republicans and five white Democrats were reported killed.
10870,23,mississippi,10870,"In rural areas, deaths of blacks could be covered up."
10871,23,mississippi,10871,"Riots (better described as massacres of blacks) took place in Vicksburg, Clinton, Macon, and in their counties, as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and lynched known black leaders, destroying local political organizations."
10872,23,mississippi,10872,"Seeing the success of this deliberate ""Mississippi Plan"", South Carolina and other states followed it and also achieved white Democratic dominance."
10873,23,mississippi,10873,"In 1877 by a national compromise, the last of federal troops were withdrawn from the region."
10874,23,mississippi,10874,"Even in this environment, black Mississippians continued to be elected to local office."
10875,23,mississippi,10875,"However, black residents were deprived of all political power after white legislators passed a new state constitution in 1890 specifically to ""eliminate the nigger from politics"", according to the state's Democratic governor, James K. Vardaman."
10876,23,mississippi,10876,It erected barriers to voter registration and instituted electoral provisions that effectively disenfranchised most black Mississippians and many poor whites.
10877,23,mississippi,10877,"Estimates are that 100,000 black and 50,000 white men were removed from voter registration rolls in the state over the next few years."
10878,23,mississippi,10878,The loss of political influence contributed to the difficulties of African Americans in their attempts to obtain extended credit in the late 19th century.
10879,23,mississippi,10879,"Together with imposition of Jim Crow and racial segregation laws, whites increased violence against blacks, lynching mostly men, through the period of the 1890s and extending to 1930."
10880,23,mississippi,10880,"Cotton crops failed due to boll weevil infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans."
10881,23,mississippi,10881,"With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands."
10882,23,mississippi,10882,They also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state.
10883,23,mississippi,10883,"In 1900, blacks made up more than half of the state's population."
10884,23,mississippi,10884,"By 1910, a majority of black farmers in the Delta had lost their land and become sharecroppers."
10885,23,mississippi,10885,"By 1920, the third generation after freedom, most African Americans in Mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty."

10887,23,mississippi,10887,"They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living."
10888,23,mississippi,10888,"In the migration of 1910–1940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity."
10889,23,mississippi,10889,Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.
10890,23,mississippi,10890,"Blacks also faced violence in the form of lynching, shooting, and the burning of churches."
10891,23,mississippi,10891,"In 1923, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People stated ""the Negro feels that life is not safe in Mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white man""."
10892,23,mississippi,10892,"In the early 20th century, some industries were established in Mississippi, but jobs were generally restricted to whites, including child workers."
10893,23,mississippi,10893,"The lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as Chicago and Detroit, seeking employment, where they also competed with European immigrants."
10894,23,mississippi,10894,"The state depended on agriculture, but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work."
10895,23,mississippi,10895,"By 1900, many white ministers, especially in the towns, subscribed to the Social Gospel movement, which attempted to apply Christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day."

10897,23,mississippi,10897,Mississippi became a dry state in 1908 by an act of the State legislature.

10914,23,mississippi,10914,"Mississippi was a center of activity, based in black churches, to educate and register black voters, and to work for integration."
10915,23,mississippi,10915,"In 1954 the state had created the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a tax-supported agency, chaired by the Governor, that claimed to work for the state's image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local White Citizens' Councils to suppress black activism."
10916,23,mississippi,10916,White Citizens Councils had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 United States Supreme Court ruling (Brown v. Board of Education) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional.

10952,23,mississippi,10952,The state's economist characterized the state as losing population as job markets elsewhere have caused 3.2 per 1000 to migrate recently.
10953,23,mississippi,10953,"From 2000 to 2010, the United States Census Bureau reported that Mississippi had the highest rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race, up 70 percent in the decade; it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population."
10954,23,mississippi,10954,"In addition, Mississippi led the nation for most of the last decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population."
10955,23,mississippi,10955,"The total population has not increased significantly, but is young."
10956,23,mississippi,10956,Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births.
10957,23,mississippi,10957,"But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity."

10962,23,mississippi,10962,"Matthew Snipp, also a demographer, commented on the increase in the 21st century in the number of people identifying as being of more than one race: ""In a sense, they're rendering a more accurate portrait of their racial heritage that in the past would have been suppressed."""
10963,23,mississippi,10963,"After having accounted for a majority of the state's population since well before the Civil War and through the 1930s, today African Americans constitute approximately 37.8 percent of the state's population."
10964,23,mississippi,10964,"Most have ancestors who were enslaved, with many forcibly transported from the Upper South in the 19th century to work on the area's new plantations."
10965,23,mississippi,10965,"Some of these slaves were mixed race, with European ancestors, as there were many children born into slavery with white fathers."

10970,23,mississippi,10970,"Ethnically, 2.7% of the total population, among all racial groups, was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race)."
10971,23,mississippi,10971,"As of 2011, 53.8% of Mississippi's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white."

10973,23,mississippi,10973,"Americans of Scots-Irish, English and Scottish ancestry are present throughout the state."
10974,23,mississippi,10974,"It is believed that there are more people with such ancestry than identify as such on the census, in part because their immigrant ancestors are more distant in their family histories."
10975,23,mississippi,10975,"English, Scottish and Scots-Irish are generally the most under-reported ancestry groups in both the South Atlantic States and the East South Central States."
10976,23,mississippi,10976,"The historian David Hackett Fischer estimated that a minimum 20% of Mississippi's population is of English ancestry, though the figure is probably much higher, and another large percentage is of Scottish ancestry."
10977,23,mississippi,10977,"Many Mississippians of such ancestry identify simply as American on questionnaires, because their families have been in North America for centuries."

11041,23,mississippi,11041,"Mississippi's rank as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton agriculture before and after the Civil War, late development of its frontier bottomlands in the Mississippi Delta, repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century that required massive capital investment in levees, and ditching and draining the bottomlands, and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities."

11070,23,mississippi,11070,"Despite the state's building and reinforcing levees for years, the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 broke through and caused massive flooding of 27,000 square miles (70,000 km2) throughout the Delta, homelessness for hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars in property damages."

11223,24,missouri,11223,"The state is named for the Missouri River, which was named after the indigenous Missouri Indians, a Siouan-language tribe."
11224,24,missouri,11224,"It is said they were called the ouemessourita (wimihsoorita), meaning ""those who have dugout canoes"", by the Miami-Illinois language speakers."
11225,24,missouri,11225,"This appears to be folk etymology—the Illinois spoke an Algonquian language and the closest approximation that can be made in that of their close neighbors, the Ojibwe, is ""You Ought to Go Downriver & Visit Those People."""
11226,24,missouri,11226,"This would be an odd occurrence, as the French who first explored and attempted to settle the Mississippi River usually got their translations during that time fairly accurate, often giving things French names that were exact translations of the native tongue(s)."
11227,24,missouri,11227,"Assuming Missouri were deriving from the Siouan language, it would translate as ""It connects to the side of it,"" in reference to the river itself."
11228,24,missouri,11228,"This is not entirely likely either, as this would be coming out as ""Maya Sunni"" (Mah-yah soo-nee)."
11229,24,missouri,11229,"Most likely, though, the name Missouri comes from Chiwere, a Siouan language spoken by people who resided in the modern-day states of Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri & Nebraska."
11230,24,missouri,11230,"The name ""Missouri"" has several different pronunciations even among its present-day natives, the two most common being (listen) miz-UR-ee and (listen) miz-UR-ə."
11231,24,missouri,11231,"Further pronunciations also exist in Missouri or elsewhere in the United States, involving the realization of the medial consonant as either or ; the vowel in the second syllable as either or ; and the third syllable as (phonetically [i] (listen), [ɪ] (listen) or [ɪ̈] (listen)) or ."
11232,24,missouri,11232,Any combination of these phonetic realizations may be observed coming from speakers of American English.
11233,24,missouri,11233,"In British received pronunciation, the preferred variant is miz-OOR-ee, with mis-OOR-ee being a possible alternative."
11234,24,missouri,11234,"The linguistic history was treated definitively by Donald M. Lance, who acknowledged that the question is sociologically complex, but no pronunciation could be declared ""correct"", nor could any be clearly defined as native or outsider, rural or urban, southern or northern, educated or otherwise."
11235,24,missouri,11235,"Politicians often employ multiple pronunciations, even during a single speech, to appeal to a greater number of listeners."
11236,24,missouri,11236,"In informal contexts respellings of the state's name, such as ""Missour-ee"" or ""Missour-uh"", are occasionally used to distinguish pronunciations phonetically."
11237,24,missouri,11237,There is no official state nickname.
11238,24,missouri,11238,"However, Missouri's unofficial nickname is the ""Show Me State,"" which appears on its license plates."
11239,24,missouri,11239,This phrase has several origins.
11240,24,missouri,11240,"One is popularly ascribed to a speech by Congressman Willard Vandiver in 1899, who declared that ""I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me."
11241,24,missouri,11241,"I'm from Missouri, and you have got to show me."""
11242,24,missouri,11242,"This is in keeping with the saying ""I'm from Missouri,"" which means ""I'm skeptical of the matter and not easily convinced."""
11243,24,missouri,11243,"However, according to researchers, the phrase ""show me"" was already in use before the 1890s."
11244,24,missouri,11244,"Another one states that it is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado to replace striking workers."
11245,24,missouri,11245,"Since the new men were unfamiliar with the mining methods, they required frequent instruction."
11246,24,missouri,11246,"Other nicknames for Missouri include ""The Lead State"", ""The Bullion State"", ""The Ozark State"", ""The Mother of the West"", ""The Iron Mountain State"", and ""Pennsylvania of the West""."
11247,24,missouri,11247,"It is also known as the ""Cave State"" because there are more than 7,300 recorded caves in the state (second to Tennessee)."
11248,24,missouri,11248,Perry County is the county with the largest number of caves and the single longest cave.
11249,24,missouri,11249,"The official state motto is Latin: ""Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto"", which means ""Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law."""
11250,24,missouri,11250,Indigenous peoples inhabited Missouri for thousands of years before European exploration and settlement.
11251,24,missouri,11251,"Archaeological excavations along the rivers have shown continuous habitation for more than 7,000 years."
11252,24,missouri,11252,"Beginning before 1000 CE, there arose the complex Mississippian culture, whose people created regional political centers at present-day St. Louis and across the Mississippi River at Cahokia, near present-day Collinsville, Illinois."
11253,24,missouri,11253,Their large cities included thousands of individual residences.
11254,24,missouri,11254,"Still, they are known for their surviving massive earthwork mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platform, ridgetop and conical shapes."
11255,24,missouri,11255,Cahokia was the center of a regional trading network that reached from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
11256,24,missouri,11256,"The civilization declined by 1400 CE, and most descendants left the area long before the arrival of Europeans."
11257,24,missouri,11257,St. Louis was at one time known as Mound City by the European Americans because of the numerous surviving prehistoric mounds since lost to urban development.
11258,24,missouri,11258,"The Mississippian culture left mounds throughout the middle Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, extending into the southeast and the upper river."
11259,24,missouri,11259,The land that became the state of Missouri was part of numerous different territories possessed changing and often indeterminate borders and had many different Native American and European names between the 1600s and statehood.
11260,24,missouri,11260,"For much of the first half of the 1700s, the west bank of the Mississippi River that would become Missouri was mostly uninhabited, something of a no man's land that kept peace between the Illinois on the east bank of the Mississippi River and to the North, and the Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley."
11261,24,missouri,11261,"In the early 1700s, French traders and missionaries explored the whole of the Mississippi Valley, named the region “Louisiana.” Around the same time, a different group of French Canadians who established five villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River placed their settlements in the le pays des Illinois, “the country of the Illinois.” When habitants - settlers of French Canadian descent - began crossing the Mississippi River to establish settlements such as Ste."
11262,24,missouri,11262,"Genevieve, they continued to place their settlements in the Illinois Country."
11263,24,missouri,11263,"At the same time, the French settlements on both sides of the Mississippi River were part of the French province of Louisiana."
11264,24,missouri,11264,"To distinguish the settlements in the Middle Mississippi Valley from French settlements in the lower Mississippi Valley around New Orleans, French officials and inhabitants referred to the Middle Mississippi Valley as La Haute Louisiane, “The High Louisiana,” or “Upper Louisiana.”"
11265,24,missouri,11265,"The first European settlers were mostly ethnic French Canadians, who created their first settlement in Missouri at present-day Ste."
11266,24,missouri,11266,"Genevieve, about an hour south of St. Louis."
11267,24,missouri,11267,They had migrated about 1750 from the Illinois Country.
11268,24,missouri,11268,"They came from colonial villages on the east side of the Mississippi River, where soils were becoming exhausted, and there was insufficient river bottom land for the growing population."
11269,24,missouri,11269,"The early Missouri settlements included many enslaved Africans and Native Americans, and slave labor was central to both commercial agriculture and the fur trade."
11270,24,missouri,11270,"Sainte-Geneviève became a thriving agricultural center, producing enough surplus wheat, corn and tobacco to ship tons of grain annually downriver to Lower Louisiana for trade."
11271,24,missouri,11271,Grain production in the Illinois Country was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.
11272,24,missouri,11272,"St. Louis was founded soon after by French fur traders, Pierre Laclède and stepson Auguste Chouteau from New Orleans in 1764."
11273,24,missouri,11273,"From 1764 to 1803, European control of the area west of the Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri River basin, called Louisiana, was assumed by the Spanish as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, due to Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order to have Spain join with France in the war against England)."
11274,24,missouri,11274,The arrival of the Spanish in St. Louis was in September 1767.
11275,24,missouri,11275,"St. Louis became the center of a regional fur trade with Native American tribes that extended up the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades."
11276,24,missouri,11276,Trading partners of major firms shipped their furs from St. Louis by river down to New Orleans for export to Europe.
11277,24,missouri,11277,They provided a variety of goods to traders for sale and trade with their Native American clients.
11278,24,missouri,11278,The fur trade and associated businesses made St. Louis an early financial center and provided the wealth for some to build fine houses and import luxury items.
11279,24,missouri,11279,Its location near the confluence of the Illinois River meant it also handled produce from the agricultural areas.
11280,24,missouri,11280,River traffic and trade along the Mississippi were integral to the state's economy.
11281,24,missouri,11281,"As the area's first major city, St. Louis expanded greatly after the invention of the steamboat and the increased river trade."
11282,24,missouri,11282,Napoleon Bonaparte had gained Louisiana for French ownership from Spain in 1800 under the Treaty of San Ildefonso after it had been a Spanish colony since 1762.
11283,24,missouri,11283,But the treaty was kept secret.
11284,24,missouri,11284,"Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the cession to the United States."
11285,24,missouri,11285,"Part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase by the United States, Missouri earned the nickname Gateway to the West because it served as a significant departure point for expeditions and settlers heading to the West during the 19th century."
11286,24,missouri,11286,"St. Charles, just west of St. Louis, was the starting point and the return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which ascended the Missouri River in 1804, to explore the western lands to the Pacific Ocean."
11287,24,missouri,11287,"St. Louis was a major supply point for decades, for parties of settlers heading west."
11288,24,missouri,11288,"As many of the early settlers in western Missouri migrated from the Upper South, they brought enslaved African Americans as agricultural laborers, and they desired to continue their culture and the institution of slavery."
11289,24,missouri,11289,"They settled predominantly in 17 counties along the Missouri River, in an area of flatlands that enabled plantation agriculture and became known as ""Little Dixie."""
11290,24,missouri,11290,The state was rocked by the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes.
11291,24,missouri,11291,Casualties were few due to the sparse population.
11292,24,missouri,11292,"In 1821, the former Missouri Territory was admitted as a slave state, under the Missouri Compromise, and with a temporary state capital in St. Charles."
11293,24,missouri,11293,"In 1826, the capital was shifted to its current, permanent location of Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River."
11294,24,missouri,11294,"Originally the state's western border was a straight line, defined as the meridian passing through the Kawsmouth, the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River."
11295,24,missouri,11295,The river has moved since this designation.
11296,24,missouri,11296,This line is known as the Osage Boundary.
11297,24,missouri,11297,"In 1836 the Platte Purchase was added to the northwest corner of the state after purchase of the land from the native tribes, making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River."
11298,24,missouri,11298,"This addition increased the land area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to Virginia's 65,000 square miles, which then included West Virginia)."
11299,24,missouri,11299,"In the early 1830s, Mormon migrants from northern states and Canada began settling near Independence and areas just north of there."
11300,24,missouri,11300,Conflicts over religion and slavery arose between the 'old settlers' (mainly from the South) and the Mormons (mainly from the North).
11301,24,missouri,11301,The Mormon War erupted in 1838.
11302,24,missouri,11302,"By 1839, with the help of an ""Extermination Order"" by Governor Lilburn Boggs, the old settlers forcefully expelled the Mormons from Missouri and confiscated their lands."
11303,24,missouri,11303,Conflicts over slavery exacerbated border tensions among the states and territories.
11304,24,missouri,11304,"From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with Iowa over the so-called Honey Lands resulted in both states' calling-up of militias along the border."
11305,24,missouri,11305,"With increasing migration, from the 1830s to the 1860s, Missouri's population almost doubled with every decade."
11306,24,missouri,11306,"Most newcomers were American-born, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s."
11307,24,missouri,11307,"As a majority were Catholic, they set up their own religious institutions in the state, which had been mostly Protestant."
11308,24,missouri,11308,"Many settled in cities, creating a regional and then state network of Catholic churches and schools."
11309,24,missouri,11309,Nineteenth-century German immigrants created the wine industry along the Missouri River and the beer industry in St. Louis.
11310,24,missouri,11310,"While many German immigrants were strongly anti-slavery, many Irish immigrants living in cities were pro-slavery, fearing that liberating African-American slaves would create a glut of unskilled labor, driving wages down."
11311,24,missouri,11311,Most Missouri farmers practiced subsistence farming before the American Civil War.
11312,24,missouri,11312,The majority of those who held slaves had fewer than five each.
11313,24,missouri,11313,"Planters, defined by some historians as those holding twenty slaves or more, were concentrated in the counties known as ""Little Dixie,"" in the central part of the state along the Missouri River."
11314,24,missouri,11314,The tensions over slavery chiefly had to do with the future of the state and nation.
11315,24,missouri,11315,"In 1860, enslaved African Americans made up less than 10% of the state's population of 1,182,012."
11316,24,missouri,11316,"In order to control the flooding of farmland and low-lying villages along the Mississippi, the state had completed construction of 140 miles (230 km) of levees along the river by 1860."
11317,24,missouri,11317,"After the secession of Southern states began in 1861, the Missouri legislature called for the election of a special convention on secession."
11318,24,missouri,11318,Pro-Southern Governor Claiborne F. Jackson ordered the mobilization of several hundred members of the state militia who had gathered in a camp in St. Louis for training.
11319,24,missouri,11319,"Alarmed at this action, Union General Nathaniel Lyon struck first, encircling the camp and forcing the state troops to surrender."
11320,24,missouri,11320,"Lyon directed his soldiers, largely non-English-speaking German immigrants, to march the prisoners through the streets, and they opened fire on the largely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them."
11321,24,missouri,11321,"Soldiers killed unarmed prisoners as well as men, women, and children of St. Louis in the incident that became known as the ""St. Louis Massacre""."
11322,24,missouri,11322,These events heightened Confederate support within the state.
11323,24,missouri,11323,"Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price, president of the convention on secession, as head of the new Missouri State Guard."
11324,24,missouri,11324,"In the face of Union General Lyon's rapid advance through the state, Jackson and Price were forced to flee the capital of Jefferson City on June 14, 1861."
11325,24,missouri,11325,"In Neosho, Missouri, Jackson called the state legislature into session to call for secession."
11326,24,missouri,11326,"However, the elected legislative body was split between pro-Union and pro-Confederate."
11327,24,missouri,11327,"As such, few of the pro-unionist attended the session called in Neosho, and the ordinance of secession was quickly adopted."
11328,24,missouri,11328,"The Confederacy recognized Missouri secession on October 30, 1861."
11329,24,missouri,11329,"With the elected governor absent from the capital and the legislators largely dispersed, the state convention was reassembled with most of its members present, save twenty who fled south with Jackson's forces."
11330,24,missouri,11330,The convention declared all offices vacant and installed Hamilton Gamble as the new governor of Missouri.
11331,24,missouri,11331,President Lincoln's administration immediately recognized Gamble's government as the legal Missouri government.
11332,24,missouri,11332,The federal government's decision enabled raising pro-Union militia forces for service within the state and volunteer regiments for the Union Army.
11333,24,missouri,11333,Fighting ensued between Union forces and a combined army of General Price's Missouri State Guard and Confederate troops from Arkansas and Texas under General Ben McCulloch.
11334,24,missouri,11334,"After winning victories at the battle of Wilson's Creek and the siege of Lexington, Missouri and suffering losses elsewhere, the Confederate forces retreated to Arkansas and later Marshall, Texas, in the face of a largely reinforced Union Army."
11335,24,missouri,11335,"Though regular Confederate troops staged some large-scale raids into Missouri, the fighting in the state for the next three years consisted chiefly of guerrilla warfare."
11336,24,missouri,11336,"""Citizen soldiers"" or insurgents such as Captain William Quantrill, Frank and Jesse James, the Younger brothers, and William T. Anderson made use of quick, small-unit tactics."
11337,24,missouri,11337,"Pioneered by the Missouri Partisan Rangers, such insurgencies also arose in portions of the Confederacy occupied by the Union during the Civil War."
11338,24,missouri,11338,"Historians have portrayed stories of the James brothers' outlaw years as an American ""Robin Hood"" myth."
11339,24,missouri,11339,"The vigilante activities of the Bald Knobbers of the Ozarks in the 1880s were an unofficial continuation of insurgent mentality long after the official end of the war, and they are a favorite theme in Branson's self-image."
11340,24,missouri,11340,"The Progressive Era (1890s to 1920s) saw numerous prominent leaders from Missouri trying to end corruption and modernize politics, government, and society."
11341,24,missouri,11341,"Joseph ""Holy Joe"" Folk was a key leader who made a strong appeal to the middle class and rural evangelical Protestants."
11342,24,missouri,11342,Folk was elected governor as a progressive reformer and Democrat in the 1904 election.
11343,24,missouri,11343,"He promoted what he called ""the Missouri Idea,"" the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of law and strict enforcement."
11344,24,missouri,11344,"He successfully conducted antitrust prosecutions, ended free railroad passes for state officials, extended bribery statutes, improved election laws, required formal registration for lobbyists, made racetrack gambling illegal and enforced the Sunday-closing law."
11345,24,missouri,11345,"He helped enact Progressive legislation, including an initiative and referendum provision, regulation of elections, education, employment and child labor, railroads, food, business, and public utilities."
11346,24,missouri,11346,"Several efficiency-oriented examiner boards and commissions were established during Folk's administration, including many agricultural boards and the Missouri library commission."
11347,24,missouri,11347,"Between the Civil War and the end of World War II, Missouri transitioned from a rural economy to a hybrid industrial-service-agricultural economy as the Midwest rapidly industrialized."
11348,24,missouri,11348,The expansion of railroads to the West transformed Kansas City into a major transportation hub within the nation.
11349,24,missouri,11349,"The growth of the Texas cattle industry along with this increased rail infrastructure and the invention of the refrigerated boxcar also made Kansas City a major meatpacking center, as large cattle drives from Texas brought herds of cattle to Dodge City and other Kansas towns."
11350,24,missouri,11350,"There, the cattle were loaded onto trains destined for Kansas City, where they were butchered and distributed to the eastern markets."
11351,24,missouri,11351,"The first half of the twentieth century was the height of Kansas City's prominence, and its downtown became a showcase for stylish Art Deco skyscrapers as construction boomed."
11352,24,missouri,11352,"In 1930, there was a diphtheria epidemic in the area around Springfield, which killed approximately 100 people."
11353,24,missouri,11353,"Serum was rushed to the area, and medical personnel stopped the epidemic."
11354,24,missouri,11354,"During the mid-1950s and 1960s, St. Louis and Kansas City suffered deindustrialization and loss of jobs in railroads and manufacturing, as did other Midwestern industrial cities."
11355,24,missouri,11355,In 1956 St. Charles claims to be the site of the first interstate highway project.
11356,24,missouri,11356,"Such highway construction made it easy for middle-class residents to leave the city for newer housing developed in the suburbs, often former farmland where land was available at lower prices."
11357,24,missouri,11357,These major cities have gone through decades of readjustment to develop different economies and adjust to demographic changes.
11358,24,missouri,11358,"Suburban areas have developed separate job markets, both in knowledge industries and services, such as major retail malls."
11359,24,missouri,11359,"In 2014, Missouri received national attention for the protests and riots that followed the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer of Ferguson, which led Governor Jay Nixon to call out the Missouri National Guard."
11360,24,missouri,11360,"A grand jury declined to indict the officer, and the US Department of Justice concluded, after careful investigation, that the police officer legitimately feared for his safety."
11361,24,missouri,11361,"However, in a separate investigation, the Department of Justice also found that the Ferguson Police Department and the City of Ferguson relied on unconstitutional practices in order to balance the city's budget through racially motivated excessive fines and punishments, that the Ferguson police ""had used excessive and dangerous force and had disproportionately targeted blacks,"" and that the municipal court ""emphasized revenue over public safety, leading to routine breaches of citizens' constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law."""
11362,24,missouri,11362,A series of student protests at the University of Missouri against what the protesters viewed as poor response by the administration to racist incidents on campus began in September 2015.
11363,24,missouri,11363,"On June 7, 2017, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to prospective African-American travelers to Missouri."
11364,24,missouri,11364,This is the first NAACP warning ever covering an entire state.
11365,24,missouri,11365,"According to a 2018 report by the Missouri Attorney General's office, for the past 18 years, ""African Americans, Hispanics and other people of color are disproportionately affected by stops, searches and arrests."""
11366,24,missouri,11366,"The same report found that the biggest discrepancy was in 2017, when ""black motorists were 85% more likely to be pulled over in traffic stops""."
11367,24,missouri,11367,In 2018 the USDA announced its plans to relocate Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food & Agriculture (NIFA) to Kansas City.
11368,24,missouri,11368,"They have since decided on a specific location in downtown Kansas City, MO."
11369,24,missouri,11369,"With the addition of the KC Streetcar project and construction of the Sprint Center Arena, the downtown area in KC has attracted investment in new offices, hotels, and residential complexes."
11370,24,missouri,11370,Both Kansas City and Saint Louis are undergoing a rebirth in their downtown areas with the addition of the new Power & Light (KC) and Ballpark Village (STL) districts and the renovation of existing historical buildings in each downtown area.
11371,24,missouri,11371,The 2019 announcement of an MLS expansion team in Saint Louis is driving even more development in the downtown west area of Saint Louis.
11372,24,missouri,11372,"Missouri is landlocked and borders eight different states, a figure equaled only by its neighbor, Tennessee."
11373,24,missouri,11373,"Missouri is bounded by Iowa on the north; by Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee across the Mississippi River on the east; on the south by Arkansas; and by Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska (the last across the Missouri River) on the west."
11374,24,missouri,11374,"Whereas the northern and southern boundaries are straight lines, the Missouri Bootheel extends south between the St. Francis and the Mississippi rivers."
11375,24,missouri,11375,"The two largest rivers are the Mississippi (which defines the eastern boundary of the state) and the Missouri River (which flows from west to east through the state), essentially connecting the two largest metros of Kansas City and St. Louis."
11376,24,missouri,11376,"Although today it is usually considered part of the Midwest, Missouri was historically seen by many as a border state, chiefly because of the settlement of migrants from the South and its status as a slave state before the Civil War, balanced by the influence of St. Louis."
11377,24,missouri,11377,"The counties that made up ""Little Dixie"" were those along the Missouri River in the center of the state, settled by Southern migrants who held the greatest concentration of slaves."
11378,24,missouri,11378,"In 2005, Missouri received 16,695,000 visitors to its national parks and other recreational areas totaling 101,000 acres (410 km2), giving it $7.41 million in annual revenues, 26.6% of its operating expenditures."
11379,24,missouri,11379,"North of, and in some cases just south of, the Missouri River lie the Northern Plains that stretch into Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas."
11380,24,missouri,11380,"Here, rolling hills remain from the glaciation that once extended from the Canadian Shield to the Missouri River."
11381,24,missouri,11381,"Missouri has many large river bluffs along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Meramec Rivers."
11382,24,missouri,11382,"Southern Missouri rises to the Ozark Mountains, a dissected plateau surrounding the Precambrian igneous St. Francois Mountains."
11383,24,missouri,11383,This region also hosts karst topography characterized by high limestone content with the formation of sinkholes and caves.
11384,24,missouri,11384,"The southeastern part of the state is known as the Missouri Bootheel region, which is part of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain or Mississippi embayment."
11385,24,missouri,11385,"This region is the lowest, flattest, warmest, and wettest part of the state."
11386,24,missouri,11386,"It is also among the poorest, as the economy there is mostly agricultural."
11387,24,missouri,11387,"It is also the most fertile, with cotton and rice crops predominant."
11388,24,missouri,11388,The Bootheel was the epicenter of the four New Madrid Earthquakes of 1811 and 1812.
11389,24,missouri,11389,"Missouri generally has a humid continental climate with cool, sometimes cold, winters and hot, humid, and wet summers."

11391,24,missouri,11391,"Located in the interior United States, Missouri often experiences extreme temperatures."
11392,24,missouri,11392,"Without high mountains or oceans nearby to moderate temperature, its climate is alternately influenced by air from the cold Arctic and the hot and humid Gulf of Mexico."
11393,24,missouri,11393,"Missouri's highest recorded temperature is 118 °F (48 °C) at Warsaw and Union on July 14, 1954, while the lowest recorded temperature is −40 °F (−40 °C) also at Warsaw on February 13, 1905."
11394,24,missouri,11394,"Located in Tornado Alley, Missouri also receives extreme weather in the form of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes."
11395,24,missouri,11395,"On May 22, 2011, a massive EF-5 tornado, killed 158 people and destroyed roughly one-third of the city of Joplin."
11396,24,missouri,11396,"The tornado caused an estimated $1–3 billion in damages, killed 159 people and injured more than a thousand."
11397,24,missouri,11397,"It was the first EF5 to hit the state since 1957 and the deadliest in the US since 1947, making it the seventh deadliest tornado in American history and 27th deadliest in the world."
11398,24,missouri,11398,"St. Louis and its suburbs also have a history of experiencing particularly severe tornadoes, the most recent memorable one being an EF4 that damaged Lambert-St. Louis International Airport on April 22, 2011."
11399,24,missouri,11399,"One of the worst tornadoes in American history struck St. Louis on May 27, 1896, killing at least 255 and causing $10 million in damage (equivalent to $3.9 billion in 2009 or $4.65 billion in today's dollars)."

11402,24,missouri,11402,"North of the Missouri River, the state is primarily rolling hills of the Great Plains, whereas south of the Missouri River, the state is dominated by the Oak-Hickory Central US hardwood forest."
11403,24,missouri,11403,"Recreational and commercial uses of public forests, including grazing, logging, and mining, increased after World War II."
11404,24,missouri,11404,"Fishermen, hikers, campers, and others started lobbying to protect forest areas with a ""wilderness character."""
11405,24,missouri,11405,"During the 1930s and 1940s Aldo Leopold, Arthur Carhart and Bob Marshall developed a ""wilderness"" policy for the Forest Service."
11406,24,missouri,11406,"Their efforts bore fruit with The Wilderness Act of 1964 which designated wilderness areas ""where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by men, where man himself is a visitor and does not remain."""
11407,24,missouri,11407,This included second growth public forests like the Mark Twain National Forest.

11651,25,montana,11651,Montana ( (listen)) is a state in the Northwestern United States.
11652,25,montana,11652,"It is bordered by Idaho to the west; North Dakota and South Dakota to the east; Wyoming to the south; and by the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan to the north."
11653,25,montana,11653,"It is the fourth-largest state by area, the eighth-least populous state, and the third-least densely populated state."
11654,25,montana,11654,"The western half of Montana contains numerous mountain ranges, while the eastern half is characterized by western prairie terrain and badlands, with more (albeit smaller) mountain ranges found throughout the state."
11655,25,montana,11655,"In all, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains."
11656,25,montana,11656,"Montana has no official nickname but several unofficial ones, most notably ""Big Sky Country"", ""The Treasure State"", ""Land of the Shining Mountains"", and ""The Last Best Place""."
11657,25,montana,11657,"The economy is primarily based on agriculture, including ranching and cereal grain farming."
11658,25,montana,11658,"Other significant economic resources include oil, gas, coal, mining, and lumber."
11659,25,montana,11659,"The health care, service, and government sectors also are significant to the state's economy."
11660,25,montana,11660,"Montana's fastest-growing sector is tourism; nearly 13 million annual tourists visit Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Beartooth Highway, Flathead Lake, Big Sky Resort, and other attractions."
11661,25,montana,11661,"The name Montana comes from the Spanish word montaña, which in turn comes from the Latin word montanea, meaning ""mountain"" or more broadly ""mountainous country""."
11662,25,montana,11662,Montaña del Norte was the name given by early Spanish explorers to the entire mountainous region of the west.
11663,25,montana,11663,The name Montana was added in 1863 to a bill by the United States House Committee on Territories (chaired at the time by James Ashley of Ohio) for the territory that would become Idaho Territory.
11664,25,montana,11664,"The name was changed by representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained Montana had ""no meaning""."
11665,25,montana,11665,"When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory."
11666,25,montana,11666,"This time, Rep. Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name."
11667,25,montana,11667,Cox complained the name was a misnomer given most of the territory was not mountainous and a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one.
11668,25,montana,11668,"Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but the Committee on Territories decided they could name it whatever they wanted, so the original name of Montana was adopted."
11669,25,montana,11669,"Montana is one of the eight Mountain States, located in the north of the region known as the Western United States."
11670,25,montana,11670,It borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east.
11671,25,montana,11671,"Wyoming is to the south, Idaho is to the west and southwest, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, are to the north, making it the only state to border three Canadian provinces."
11672,25,montana,11672,"With an area of 147,040 square miles (380,800 km2), Montana is slightly larger than Japan."
11673,25,montana,11673,"It is the fourth-largest state in the United States after Alaska, Texas, and California; it is the largest landlocked state."
11674,25,montana,11674,"The state's topography is roughly defined by the Continental Divide, which splits much of the state into distinct eastern and western regions."
11675,25,montana,11675,"Most of Montana's hundred or more named mountain ranges are in the state's western half, most of which is geologically and geographically part of the northern Rocky Mountains."
11676,25,montana,11676,The Absaroka and Beartooth ranges in the state's south-central part are technically part of the Central Rocky Mountains.
11677,25,montana,11677,"The Rocky Mountain Front is a significant feature in the state's north-central portion, and isolated island ranges that interrupt the prairie landscape common in the central and eastern parts of the state."
11678,25,montana,11678,"About 60 percent of the state is prairie, part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains—one of the longest continuous ranges in the Rocky Mountain chain from Alaska to Mexico—along with smaller ranges, including the Coeur d'Alene Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the state from Idaho."
11680,25,montana,11680,The southern third of the Bitterroot range blends into the Continental Divide.
11681,25,montana,11681,"Other major mountain ranges west of the divide include the Cabinet Mountains, the Anaconda Range, the Missions, the Garnet Range, the Sapphire Mountains, and the Flint Creek Range."
11682,25,montana,11682,"The divide's northern section, where the mountains rapidly give way to prairie, is part of the Rocky Mountain Front."
11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is most pronounced in the Lewis Range, located primarily in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684,"Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (which begins in Alaska's Seward Peninsula) crosses this region and turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak."
11685,25,montana,11685,"It causes the Waterton River, Belly, and Saint Mary rivers to flow north into Alberta, Canada."
11686,25,montana,11686,"There they join the Saskatchewan River, which ultimately empties into Hudson Bay."
11687,25,montana,11687,"East of the divide, several roughly parallel ranges cover the state's southern part, including the Gravelly Range, Madison Range, Gallatin Range, Absaroka Mountains, and Beartooth Mountains."
11688,25,montana,11688,"The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass over 10,000 feet (3,000 m) high in the continental United States."
11689,25,montana,11689,"It contains the state's highest point, Granite Peak, 12,799 feet (3,901 m) high."
11690,25,montana,11690,"North of these ranges are the Big Belt Mountains, Bridger Mountains, Tobacco Roots, and several island ranges, including the Crazy Mountains and Little Belt Mountains."
11691,25,montana,11691,Between many mountain ranges are rich river valleys.
11692,25,montana,11692,"The Big Hole Valley, Bitterroot Valley, Gallatin Valley, Flathead Valley, and Paradise Valley have extensive agricultural resources and multiple opportunities for tourism and recreation."
11693,25,montana,11693,"East and north of this transition zone are the expansive and sparsely populated Northern Plains, with tableland prairies, smaller island mountain ranges, and badlands."
11694,25,montana,11694,"The isolated island ranges east of the Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains, Bull Mountains, Castle Mountains, Crazy Mountains, Highwood Mountains, Judith Mountains, Little Belt Mountains, Little Rocky Mountains, the Pryor Mountains, Little Snowy Mountains, Big Snowy Mountains, Sweet Grass Hills, and—in the state's southeastern corner near Ekalaka—the Long Pines."
11695,25,montana,11695,Many of these isolated eastern ranges were created about 120 to 66 million years ago when magma welling up from the interior cracked and bowed the earth's surface here.
11696,25,montana,11696,The area east of the divide in the state' north-central portion is known for the Missouri Breaks and other significant rock formations.
11697,25,montana,11697,"Three buttes south of Great Falls are major landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw, and Buttes."
11698,25,montana,11698,"Known as laccoliths, they formed when igneous rock protruded through cracks in the sedimentary rock."
11699,25,montana,11699,The underlying surface consists of sandstone and shale.
11700,25,montana,11700,"Surface soils in the area are highly diverse, and greatly affected by the local geology, whether glaciated plain, intermountain basin, mountain foothills, or tableland."
11701,25,montana,11701,"Foothill regions are often covered in weathered stone or broken slate, or consist of uncovered bare rock (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone, or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil of intermountain basins usually consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt, and volcanic ash, much of it laid down by lakes which covered the region during the Oligocene 33 to 23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"Tablelands are often topped with argillite gravel and weathered quartzite, occasionally underlain by shale."
11704,25,montana,11704,"The glaciated plains are generally covered in clay, gravel, sand, and silt left by the proglacial Lake Great Falls or by moraines or gravel-covered former lake basins left by the Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago."
11705,25,montana,11705,"Farther east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka contain some of the most scenic badlands regions in the state."
11706,25,montana,11706,The Hell Creek Formation in Northeast Montana is a major source of dinosaur fossils.
11707,25,montana,11707,Paleontologist Jack Horner of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman brought this formation to the world's attention with several major finds.
11708,25,montana,11708,"Montana has thousands of named rivers and creeks, 450 miles (720 km) of which are known for ""blue-ribbon"" trout fishing."
11709,25,montana,11709,"Montana's water resources provide for recreation, hydropower, crop and forage irrigation, mining, and water for human consumption."
11710,25,montana,11710,Montana is one of few geographic areas in the world whose rivers form parts of three major watersheds (i.e.
11711,25,montana,11711,where two continental divides intersect).
11712,25,montana,11712,"Its rivers feed the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and Hudson Bay."
11713,25,montana,11713,The watersheds divide at Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park.
11714,25,montana,11714,"If Hudson Bay is considered part of the Arctic Ocean, Triple Divide Peak is the only place on Earth with drainage to three different oceans."
11715,25,montana,11715,All waters in Montana west of the divide flow into the Columbia River.
11716,25,montana,11716,"The Clark Fork of the Columbia (not to be confused with the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River) rises near Butte and flows northwest to Missoula, where it is joined by the Blackfoot River and Bitterroot River."
11717,25,montana,11717,"Farther downstream, it is joined by the Flathead River before entering Idaho near Lake Pend Oreille."
11718,25,montana,11718,The Pend Oreille River forms the outflow of Lake Pend Oreille.
11719,25,montana,11719,"The Pend Oreille River joined the Columbia River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean—making the 579-mile (932 km) long Clark Fork/Pend Oreille (considered a single river system) the longest river in the Rocky Mountains."
11720,25,montana,11720,The Clark Fork discharges the greatest volume of water of any river exiting the state.
11721,25,montana,11721,The Kootenai River in northwest Montana is another major tributary of the Columbia.
11722,25,montana,11722,"East of the divide the Missouri River, which is formed by the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers near Three Forks, flows due north through the west-central part of the state to Great Falls."
11723,25,montana,11723,"From this point, it then flows generally east through fairly flat agricultural land and the Missouri Breaks to Fort Peck reservoir."
11724,25,montana,11724,The stretch of river between Fort Benton and the Fred Robinson Bridge at the western boundary of Fort Peck Reservoir was designated a National Wild and Scenic River in 1976.
11725,25,montana,11725,"The Missouri enters North Dakota near Fort Union, having drained more than half the land area of Montana (82,000 square miles (210,000 km2))."
11726,25,montana,11726,"Nearly one-third of the Missouri River in Montana lies behind 10 dams: Toston, Canyon Ferry, Hauser, Holter, Black Eagle, Rainbow, Cochrane, Ryan, Morony, and Fort Peck."
11727,25,montana,11727,"Other major Montana tributaries of the Missouri include the Smith, Milk, Marias, Judith, and Musselshell Rivers."
11728,25,montana,11728,"Montana also claims the disputed title of possessing the world's shortest river, the Roe River, just outside Great Falls."
11729,25,montana,11729,"Through the Missouri, these rivers ultimately join the Mississippi River and flow into the Gulf of Mexico."
11730,25,montana,11730,"Hell Roaring Creek begins in southern Montana, and when combined with the Red Rock, Beaverhead, Jefferson, Missouri, and Mississippi River, is the longest river in North America and the fourth longest river in the world."
11731,25,montana,11731,The Yellowstone River rises on the Continental Divide near Younts Peak in Wyoming's Teton Wilderness.
11732,25,montana,11732,"It flows north through Yellowstone National Park, enters Montana near Gardiner, and passes through the Paradise Valley to Livingston."
11733,25,montana,11733,"It then flows northeasterly across the state through Billings, Miles City, Glendive, and Sidney."
11734,25,montana,11734,The Yellowstone joins the Missouri in North Dakota just east of Fort Union.
11735,25,montana,11735,"It is the longest undammed, free-flowing river in the contiguous United States, and drains about a quarter of Montana (36,000 square miles (93,000 km2))."
11736,25,montana,11736,"Major tributaries of the Yellowstone include the Boulder, Stillwater, Clarks Fork, Bighorn, Tongue, and Powder Rivers."
11737,25,montana,11737,"The Northern Divide turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak, causing the Waterton, Belly, and Saint Mary Rivers to flow north into Alberta."
11738,25,montana,11738,"There they join the Saskatchewan River, which ultimately empties into Hudson Bay."
11739,25,montana,11739,"Montana has some 3,000 named lakes and reservoirs, including Flathead Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake in the western United States."
11740,25,montana,11740,Other major lakes include Whitefish Lake in the Flathead Valley and Lake McDonald and St. Mary Lake in Glacier National Park.
11741,25,montana,11741,"The largest reservoir in the state is Fort Peck Reservoir on the Missouri river, which is contained by the second largest earthen dam and largest hydraulically filled dam in the world."
11742,25,montana,11742,"Other major reservoirs include Hungry Horse on the Flathead River; Lake Koocanusa on the Kootenai River; Lake Elwell on the Marias River; Clark Canyon on the Beaverhead River; Yellowtail on the Bighorn River, Canyon Ferry, Hauser, Holter, Rainbow; and Black Eagle on the Missouri River."
11743,25,montana,11743,"Vegetation of the state includes lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, larch, spruce, aspen, birch, red cedar, hemlock, ash, alder, rocky mountain maple and cottonwood trees."
11744,25,montana,11744,Forests cover about 25% of the state.
11745,25,montana,11745,"Flowers native to Montana include asters, bitterroots, daisies, lupins, poppies, primroses, columbine, lilies, orchids, and dryads."
11746,25,montana,11746,Several species of sagebrush and cactus and many species of grasses are common.
11747,25,montana,11747,Many species of mushrooms and lichens are also found in the state.
11748,25,montana,11748,"Montana is home to diverse fauna including 14 amphibian, 90 fish, 117 mammal, 20 reptile, and 427 bird species."

11764,25,montana,11764,These lands are managed by the state for the benefit of public schools and institutions in the state.
11765,25,montana,11765,Areas managed by the National Park Service include:
11766,25,montana,11766,"Montana is a large state with considerable variation in geography, topography and altitude, and the climate is, therefore, equally varied."
11767,25,montana,11767,"The state spans from below the 45th parallel (the line equidistant between the equator and North Pole) to the 49th parallel, and elevations range from under 2,000 feet (610 m) to nearly 13,000 feet (4,000 m) above sea level."
11768,25,montana,11768,"The western half is mountainous, interrupted by numerous large valleys."
11769,25,montana,11769,"Eastern Montana comprises plains and badlands, broken by hills and isolated mountain ranges, and has a semiarid, continental climate (Köppen climate classification BSk)."
11770,25,montana,11770,"The Continental Divide has a considerable effect on the climate, as it restricts the flow of warmer air from the Pacific from moving east, and drier continental air from moving west."
11771,25,montana,11771,"The area west of the divide has a modified northern Pacific Coast climate, with milder winters, cooler summers, less wind, and a longer growing season."
11772,25,montana,11772,"Low clouds and fog often form in the valleys west of the divide in winter, but this is rarely seen in the east."
11773,25,montana,11773,Average daytime temperatures vary from 28 °F or −2.2 °C in January to 84.5 °F or 29.2 °C in July.
11774,25,montana,11774,The variation in geography leads to great variation in temperature.
11775,25,montana,11775,"The highest observed summer temperature was 117 °F or 47.2 °C at Glendive on July 20, 1893, and Medicine Lake on July 5, 1937."
11776,25,montana,11776,"Throughout the state, summer nights are generally cool and pleasant."
11777,25,montana,11777,"Extreme hot weather is less common above 4,000 feet or 1,200 meters."
11778,25,montana,11778,"Snowfall has been recorded in all months of the year in the more mountainous areas of central and western Montana, though it is rare in July and August."
11779,25,montana,11779,The coldest temperature on record for Montana is also the coldest temperature for the contiguous United States.
11780,25,montana,11780,"On January 20, 1954, −70 °F or −56.7 °C was recorded at a gold mining camp near Rogers Pass."
11781,25,montana,11781,"Temperatures vary greatly on cold nights, and Helena, 40 miles (64 km) to the southeast had a low of only −36 °F or −37.8 °C on the same date, and an all-time record low of −42 °F or −41.1 °C."
11782,25,montana,11782,Winter cold spells are usually the result of cold continental air coming south from Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The front is often well defined, causing a large temperature drop in a 24-hour period."
11784,25,montana,11784,"Conversely, air flow from the southwest results in ""chinooks""."
11785,25,montana,11785,"These steady 25–50 mph (40–80 km/h) (or more) winds can suddenly warm parts of Montana, especially areas just to the east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise up to 50–60 °F (10.0–15.6 °C) for 10 days or longer."
11786,25,montana,11786,Loma is the site of the most extreme recorded temperature change in a 24-hour period in the United States.
11787,25,montana,11787,"On January 15, 1972, a chinook wind blew in and the temperature rose from −54 to 49 °F (−47.8 to 9.4 °C)."
11788,25,montana,11788,"Average annual precipitation is 15 inches (380 mm), but great variations are seen."
11789,25,montana,11789,"The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air, holding moisture in the western valleys, and creating rain shadows to the east."
11790,25,montana,11790,"Heron, in the west, receives the most precipitation, 34.70 inches (881 mm)."
11791,25,montana,11791,"On the eastern (leeward) side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches (291 mm), and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation."
11792,25,montana,11792,"The mountains can receive over 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches (2,700 mm)."
11793,25,montana,11793,An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a 16-year period.
11794,25,montana,11794,Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 meters of snow each year.
11795,25,montana,11795,Mountain ranges can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 meters of snow during a winter.
11796,25,montana,11796,"Heavy snowstorms may occur from September through May, though most snow falls from November to March."
11797,25,montana,11797,The climate has become warmer in Montana and continues to do so.
11798,25,montana,11798,The glaciers in Glacier National Park have receded and are predicted to melt away completely in a few decades.
11799,25,montana,11799,"Many Montana cities set heat records during July 2007, the hottest month ever recorded in Montana."
11800,25,montana,11800,"Winters are warmer, too, and have fewer cold spells."
11801,25,montana,11801,"Previously, these cold spells had killed off bark beetles, but these are now attacking the forests of western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the region have allowed various species to expand their ranges and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, attack by beetles, and mismanagement has led to a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804,"According to a study done for the US Environmental Protection Agency by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science, parts of Montana will experience a 200% increase in area burned by wildfires, and an 80% increase in related air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below lists average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month for Montana's seven largest cities.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on location, although figures are similar throughout."
11807,25,montana,11807,Montana is one of only two contiguous states (along with Colorado) that are antipodal to land.
11808,25,montana,11808,The Kerguelen Islands are antipodal to the Montana–Saskatchewan–Alberta border.
11809,25,montana,11809,"No towns are precisely antipodal to Kerguelen, though Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples lived in the territory of the present-day state of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811,"Historic tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers from the United States included the Crow in the south-central area, the Cheyenne in the very southeast, the Blackfeet, Assiniboine, and Gros Ventres in the central and north-central area, and the Kootenai and Salish in the west."
11812,25,montana,11812,"The smaller Pend d'Oreille and Kalispel tribes lived near Flathead Lake and the western mountains, respectively."
11813,25,montana,11813,A part of southeastern Montana was used as a corridor between the Crows and the related Hidatsas in North Dakota.
11814,25,montana,11814,The land in Montana east of the continental divide was part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
11815,25,montana,11815,"Subsequent to and particularly in the decades following the Lewis and Clark Expedition, American, British, and French traders operated a fur trade, typically working with indigenous peoples, in both eastern and western portions of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816,"These dealings were not always peaceful, and though the fur trade brought some material gain for indigenous tribal groups, it also brought exposure to European diseases and altered their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The trading post Fort Raymond (1807–1811) was constructed in Crow Indian country in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818,"Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), land west of the continental divide was disputed between the British and US and was known as the Oregon Country."
11819,25,montana,11819,The first permanent settlement by Euro-Americans in what today is Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near present-day Stevensville.
11820,25,montana,11820,"In 1847, Fort Benton was established as the uppermost fur-trading post on the Missouri River."
11821,25,montana,11821,"In the 1850s, settlers began moving into the Beaverhead and Big Hole valleys from the Oregon Trail and into the Clark's Fork valley."
11822,25,montana,11822,The first gold discovered in Montana was at Gold Creek near present-day Garrison in 1852.
11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state starting in 1862 found gold, silver, copper, lead, and coal (and later oil) which attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area."
11824,25,montana,11824,"The richest of all gold placer diggings was discovered at Alder Gulch, where the town of Virginia City was established."
11825,25,montana,11825,"Other rich placer deposits were found at Last Chance Gulch, where the city of Helena now stands, Confederate Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City."
11826,25,montana,11826,Gold output from 1862 through 1876 reached $144 million
11827,25,montana,11827,"The largest mining operations were in the city of Butte, which had important silver deposits and gigantic copper deposits."
11828,25,montana,11828,"Before the creation of Montana Territory (1864–1889), areas within present-day Montana were part of the Oregon Territory (1848–1859), Washington Territory (1853–1863), Idaho Territory (1863–1864), and Dakota Territory (1861–1864)."
11829,25,montana,11829,"Montana became a United States territory (Montana Territory) on May 26, 1864."
11830,25,montana,11830,The first territorial capital was at Bannack.
11831,25,montana,11831,The first territorial governor was Sidney Edgerton.
11832,25,montana,11832,The capital moved to Virginia City in 1865 and to Helena in 1875.
11833,25,montana,11833,"In 1870, the non-Indian population of Montana Territory was 20,595."
11834,25,montana,11834,"The Montana Historical Society, founded on February 2, 1865, in Virginia City, is the oldest such institution west of the Mississippi (excluding Louisiana)."
11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870 respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and the Washburn–Langford–Doane Expeditions were launched from Helena into the Upper Yellowstone region and directly led to the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As settlers began populating Montana from the 1850s through the 1870s, disputes with Native Americans ensued, primarily over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens negotiated the Hellgate treaty between the United States government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and Kootenai people of western Montana, which established boundaries for the tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838,The treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839,"While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reservation, trouble with interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led Whites to believe the Bitterroot Valley was opened to settlement, but the tribal nations disputed those provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first US Army post established in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect steamboat traffic going to Fort Benton."
11842,25,montana,11842,More than a dozen additional military outposts were established in the state.
11843,25,montana,11843,Pressure over land ownership and control increased due to discoveries of gold in various parts of Montana and surrounding states.
11844,25,montana,11844,"Major battles occurred in Montana during Red Cloud's War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, and the Nez Perce War and in conflicts with Piegan Blackfeet."
11845,25,montana,11845,"The most notable were the Marias Massacre (1870), Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), Battle of the Big Hole (1877), and Battle of Bear Paw (1877)."
11846,25,montana,11846,The last recorded conflict in Montana between the US Army and Native Americans occurred in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in the Big Horn country.
11847,25,montana,11847,Indian survivors who had signed treaties were generally required to move onto reservations.
11848,25,montana,11848,"Simultaneously with these conflicts, bison, a keystone species and the primary protein source that Native people had survived on for centuries, were being destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849,Some estimates say more than 13 million bison were in Montana in 1870.
11850,25,montana,11850,"In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded to a joint session of Congress to authorize the slaughtering of herds to deprive the Indians of their source of food."
11851,25,montana,11851,"By 1884, commercial hunting had brought bison to the verge of extinction; only about 325 bison remained in the entire United States."
11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle ranching has been central to Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and traded cattle fattened in fertile Montana valleys with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.
11853,25,montana,11853,Nelson Story brought the first Texas Longhorn cattle into the territory in 1866.
11854,25,montana,11854,"Granville Stuart, Samuel Hauser, and Andrew J. Davis started a major open-range cattle operation in Fergus County in 1879."
11855,25,montana,11855,The Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site in Deer Lodge is maintained today as a link to the ranching style of the late 19th century.
11856,25,montana,11856,"Operated by the National Park Service, it is a 1,900-acre (7.7 km2) working ranch."
11857,25,montana,11857,Tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad (NPR) reached Montana from the west in 1881 and from the east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858,"However, the railroad played a major role in sparking tensions with Native American tribes in the 1870s."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, the NPR president, launched major surveys into the Yellowstone valley in 1871, 1872, and 1873, which were challenged forcefully by the Sioux under chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860,"These clashes, in part, contributed to the Panic of 1873, a financial crisis that delayed construction of the railroad into Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"Surveys in 1874, 1875, and 1876 helped spark the Great Sioux War of 1876."
11862,25,montana,11862,"The transcontinental NPR was completed on September 8, 1883, at Gold Creek."
11863,25,montana,11863,"Tracks of the Great Northern Railroad (GNR) reached eastern Montana in 1887 and when they reached the northern Rocky Mountains in 1890, the GNR became a significant promoter of tourism to Glacier National Park region."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893, at Scenic, Washington."
11865,25,montana,11865,"In 1881, the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch line of the Union Pacific, completed a narrow-gauge line from northern Utah to Butte."
11866,25,montana,11866,"A number of smaller spur lines operated in Montana from 1881 into the 20th century, including the Oregon Short Line, Montana Railroad, and Milwaukee Road."
11867,25,montana,11867,"Under Territorial Governor Thomas Meagher, Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a failed bid for statehood."
11868,25,montana,11868,A second constitutional convention held in Helena in 1884 produced a constitution ratified 3:1 by Montana citizens in November 1884.
11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress did not approve Montana statehood until February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting statehood to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington once the appropriate state constitutions were crafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,"In July 1889, Montanans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government."
11871,25,montana,11871,"On November 8, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana the union's 41st state."
11872,25,montana,11872,The first state governor was Joseph K. Toole.
11873,25,montana,11873,"In the 1880s, Helena (the state capital) had more millionaires per capita than any other United States city."
11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land to settlers who could claim and ""prove-up"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875,Montana did not see a large influx of immigrants from this act because 160 acres were usually insufficient to support a family in the arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,The first homestead claim under the act in Montana was made by David Carpenter near Helena in 1868.
11877,25,montana,11877,"The first claim by a woman was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana pioneer, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"By 1880, farms were in the more verdant valleys of central and western Montana, but few were on the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Land Act of 1877 was passed to allow settlement of arid lands in the west and allotted 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a fee of $.25 per acre and a promise to irrigate the land.
11880,25,montana,11880,"After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would be owned by the settler."
11881,25,montana,11881,"This act brought mostly cattle and sheep ranchers into Montana, many of whom grazed their herds on the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land and then abandoned it without paying the final fees."
11882,25,montana,11882,"Some farmers came with the arrival of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroads throughout the 1880s and 1890s, though in relatively small numbers."
11883,25,montana,11883,"In the early 1900s, James J. Hill of the Great Northern began to promote settlement in the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods."
11884,25,montana,11884,Other railroads followed suit.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the Reclamation Act was passed, allowing irrigation projects to be built in Montana's eastern river valleys."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909, Congress passed the Enlarged Homestead Act that expanded the amount of free land from 160 to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family and in 1912 reduced the time to ""prove up"" on a claim to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act allowed homesteads of 640 acres in areas unsuitable for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888,"This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act drew tens of thousands of homesteaders, lured by free land, with World War I bringing particularly high wheat prices."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana was going through a temporary period of higher-than-average precipitation."
11890,25,montana,11890,"Homesteaders arriving in this period were known as ""Honyockers"", or ""scissorbills""."
11891,25,montana,11891,"Though the word ""honyocker"", possibly derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisive manner at homesteaders as being ""greenhorns"", ""new at his business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had farming experience, though many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892,"However, farmers faced a number of problems."
11893,25,montana,11893,Massive debt was one.
11894,25,montana,11894,"Also, most settlers were from wetter regions, unprepared for the dry climate, lack of trees, and scarce water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small homesteads of fewer than 320 acres (130 ha) were unsuited to the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896,Weather and agricultural conditions are much harsher and drier west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897,"Then, the droughts of 1917–1921 proved devastating."
11898,25,montana,11898,"Many people left, and half the banks in the state went bankrupt as a result of providing mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, farm sizes increased while the number of farms decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"By 1910, homesteaders filed claims on over five million acres, and by 1923, over 93 million acres were farmed."
11901,25,montana,11901,"In 1910, the Great Falls land office alone had more than a thousand homestead filings per month, and at the peak of 1917–1918 it had 14,000 new homesteads each year."
11902,25,montana,11902,Significant drops occurred following the drought in 1919.
11903,25,montana,11903,"As World War I broke out, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in the United States to be a member of Congress, voted against the United States' declaration of war."
11904,25,montana,11904,"Her actions were widely criticized in Montana, where support for the war and patriotism were strong."
11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917–18, due to a miscalculation of Montana's population, about 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the state's population, volunteered or were drafted into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906,This represented a manpower contribution to the war that was 25% higher than any other state on a per capita basis.
11907,25,montana,11907,"Around 1500 Montanans died as a result of the war and 2437 were wounded, also higher than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908,"Montana's Remount station in Miles City provided 10,000 cavalry horses for the war, more than any other Army post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for Montana mining, lumber, and farming interests, as demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the US Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the Sedition Act of 1918."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Montana legislature had passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912,"In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the US government, military, or symbols through speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana Act led to the arrest of more than 200 individuals and the conviction of 78, mostly of German or Austrian descent."
11914,25,montana,11914,More than 40 spent time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, then-Governor Brian Schweitzer posthumously issued full pardons for all those convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed US entry into the war included immigrant groups of German and Irish heritage, as well as pacifist Anabaptist people such as the Hutterites and Mennonites, many of whom were also of Germanic heritage."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-War groups formed, such as the Montana Council of Defense, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and local ""loyalty committees""."
11918,25,montana,11918,War sentiment was complicated by labor issues.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The Anaconda Copper Company, which was at its historic peak of copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and unions struggling to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multiethnic community with significant European immigrant population, labor unions, particularly the newly formed Metal Mine Workers' Union, opposed the war on grounds it mostly profited large lumber and mining interests."
11921,25,montana,11921,"In the wake of ramped-up mine production and the Speculator Mine disaster in June 1917, Industrial Workers of the World organizer Frank Little arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave some speeches with inflammatory antiwar rhetoric.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On August 1, 1917, he was dragged from his boarding house by masked vigilantes, and hanged from a railroad trestle, considered a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,Little's murder and the strikes that followed resulted in the National Guard being sent to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925,"Overall, anti-German and antilabor sentiment increased and created a movement that led to the passage of the Montana Sedition Act the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Council of Defense was made a state agency with the power to prosecute and punish individuals deemed in violation of the Act."
11927,25,montana,11927,The council also passed rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting the speaking of German in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"In the wake of the legislative action in 1918, emotions rose."
11929,25,montana,11929,US Attorney Burton K. Wheeler and several district court judges who hesitated to prosecute or convict people brought up on charges were strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930,"Wheeler was brought before the Council of Defense, though he avoided formal proceedings, and a district court judge from Forsyth was impeached."
11931,25,montana,11931,Burnings of German-language books and several near-hangings occurred.
11932,25,montana,11932,The prohibition on speaking German remained in effect into the early 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Complicating the wartime struggles, the 1918 influenza epidemic claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanans."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that occurred led some historians to dub this period ""Montana's Agony""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after World War I and lasted through the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936,"This caused great hardship for farmers, ranchers, and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937,"The wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state a major producer; the wheat has a relatively high protein content, thus commands premium prices."
11938,25,montana,11938,"By the time the US entered World War II on December 8, 1941, many Montanans had enlisted in the military to escape the poor national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Another 40,000-plus Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war, and more than 57,000 joined up before the war ended."
11940,25,montana,11940,"These numbers constituted about ten percent of the state's population, and Montana again contributed one of the highest numbers of soldiers per capita of any state."
11941,25,montana,11941,"Many Native Americans were among those who served, including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,At least 1500 Montanans died in the war.
11943,25,montana,11943,"Montana also was the training ground for the First Special Service Force or ""Devil's Brigade"", a joint USCanadian commando-style force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for experience in mountainous and winter conditions before deployment."
11944,25,montana,11944,"Air bases were built in Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank, and Glasgow, some of which were used as staging areas to prepare planes to be sent to allied forces in the Soviet Union."

12037,25,montana,12037,"*In the 1980s the absence of a sales tax became economically deleterious to communities bound to the state's tourism industry, as the revenue from income and property taxes provided by residents was grossly insignificant in regards to paying for the impact of non-residential travel—especially road repair."

12253,25,montana,12253,"This shift continued with the reapportionment of the state's legislative districts that took effect in 1994, when the Republican Party took control of both chambers of the state legislature, consolidating a Republican party dominance that lasted until the 2004 reapportionment produced more swing districts and a brief period of Democratic legislative majorities in the mid-2000s."

12265,25,montana,12265,"Montana's single congressional district holds the largest population of any district in the country, which means its one member in the House of Representatives represents more people than any other member of the US House (see List of US states by population)."

12278,25,montana,12278,"The state flower, the Bitterroot, was adopted in 1895 with the support of a group called the Floral Emblem Association, which formed after Montana's Women's Christian Temperance Union adopted the bitterroot as the organization's state flower."
12279,25,montana,12279,"All other symbols were adopted throughout the 20th century, save for Montana's newest symbol, the state butterfly, the mourning cloak, adopted in 2001, and the state lullaby, ""Montana Lullaby"", adopted in 2007."
12280,25,montana,12280,"The state song was not composed until 21 years after statehood, when a musical troupe led by Joseph E. Howard stopped in Butte in September 1910."
12281,25,montana,12281,"A former member of the troupe who lived in Butte buttonholed Howard at an after-show party, asking him to compose a song about Montana and got another partygoer, the city editor for the Butte Miner newspaper, Charles C. Cohan, to help."
12282,25,montana,12282,"The two men worked up a basic melody and lyrics in about a half-hour for the entertainment of party guests, then finished the song later that evening, with an arrangement worked up the following day."

12286,25,montana,12286,Montana schoolchildren played a significant role in selecting several state symbols.
12287,25,montana,12287,"The state tree, the ponderosa pine, was selected by Montana schoolchildren as the preferred state tree by an overwhelming majority in a referendum held in 1908."
12288,25,montana,12288,"However, the legislature did not designate a state tree until 1949, when the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs, with the support of the state forester, lobbied for formal recognition."
12289,25,montana,12289,"Schoolchildren also chose the western meadowlark as the state bird, in a 1930 vote, and the legislature acted to endorse this decision in 1931."
12290,25,montana,12290,"Similarly, the secretary of state sponsored a children's vote in 1981 to choose a state animal, and after 74 animals were nominated, the grizzly bear won over the elk by a 2–1 margin."
12291,25,montana,12291,The students of Livingston started a statewide school petition drive plus lobbied the governor and the state legislature to name the Maiasaura as the state fossil in 1985.
12292,25,montana,12292,Various community civic groups also played a role in selecting the state grass and the state gemstones.
12293,25,montana,12293,"When broadcaster Norma Ashby discovered there was no state fish, she initiated a drive via her television show, Today in Montana, and an informal citizen's election to select a state fish resulted in a win for the blackspotted cutthroat trout after hot competition from the Arctic grayling."
12294,25,montana,12294,The legislature in turn adopted this recommendation by a wide margin.

12313,26,nebraska,12313,Chinook wind tends to warm the state significantly in the winter and early spring.
12314,26,nebraska,12314,"Nebraska's name is the result of anglicization of the archaic Otoe words Ñí Brásge, pronounced [ɲĩbɾasꜜkɛ] (contemporary Otoe Ñí Bráhge), or the Omaha Ní Btháska, pronounced [nĩbɫᶞasꜜka], meaning ""flat water"", after the Platte River which flows through the state."

12322,26,nebraska,12322,The massacre ended Spanish exploration of the area for the remainder of the 18th century.
12323,26,nebraska,12323,"In 1762, during the Seven Years' War, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain."
12324,26,nebraska,12324,"This left Britain and Spain competing for dominance along the Mississippi; by 1773, the British were trading with the native peoples of Nebraska."
12325,26,nebraska,12325,"In response, Spain dispatched two trading expeditions up the Missouri in 1794 and 1795; the second, under James Mackay, established the first European settlement in Nebraska near the mouth of the Platte."

12335,26,nebraska,12335,"Because so few trees grew on the prairies, many of the first farming settlers built their homes of sod, as had Native Americans such as the Omaha."
12336,26,nebraska,12336,The first wave of settlement gave the territory a sufficient population to apply for statehood.

12340,26,nebraska,12340,Several factors contributed to attracting new residents.
12341,26,nebraska,12341,The first was that the vast prairie land was perfect for cattle grazing.
12342,26,nebraska,12342,This helped settlers to learn the unfamiliar geography of the area.
12343,26,nebraska,12343,The second factor was the invention of several farming technologies.
12344,26,nebraska,12344,"Agricultural inventions such as barbed wire, wind mills, and the steel plow, combined with good weather, enabled settlers to use Nebraska as prime farming land."

Norris (who served a few years in the Senatorte as an independent), J. James Exon, Bob Kerrey, and Chuck Hagel."

12589,27,nevada,12589,"They also founded the first white settlement in what is now Nevada, Mormon Station (modern-day Genoa), in 1851."
12590,27,nevada,12590,"In June 1855, William Bringhurst and 29 fellow Mormon missionaries from Utah arrived at a site just northeast of downtown Las Vegas and built a 150-foot square adobe fort, the first permanent structure erected in the valley, which remained under the control of Salt Lake City until the winter of 1858–1859."
12591,27,nevada,12591,"As a result of the Mexican–American War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico permanently lost Alta California in 1848."
12592,27,nevada,12592,The new areas acquired by the United States continued to be administered as territories.
12593,27,nevada,12593,"As part of the Mexican Cession (1848) and the subsequent California Gold Rush that used Emigrant Trails through the area, the state's area evolved first as part of the Utah Territory, then the Nevada Territory (March 2, 1861; named for the Sierra Nevada)."
12594,27,nevada,12594,"See History of Utah, History of Las Vegas, and the discovery of the first major US deposit of silver ore in Comstock Lode under Virginia City, Nevada, in 1859."
12595,27,nevada,12595,"On March 2, 1861, the Nevada Territory separated from the Utah Territory and adopted its current name, shortened from The Sierra Nevada (Spanish for ""snow-covered mountain range"")."
12596,27,nevada,12596,The 1861 southern boundary is commemorated by Nevada Historical Markers 57 and 58 in Lincoln and Nye counties.
12597,27,nevada,12597,"Eight days before the presidential election of 1864, Nevada became the 36th state in the union, despite lacking the minimum requisite 60,000 residents in order to become a state."
12598,27,nevada,12598,"(At the time Nevada's population was little more than 10,000.)"
12599,27,nevada,12599,"Rather than sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27 – the most costly telegraph on file at the time for a single dispatch."
12600,27,nevada,12600,"Finally, the response from Washington came on October 31, 1864: ""the pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day was admitted into the Union""."
12601,27,nevada,12601,"Statehood was rushed to the date of October 31 to help ensure Abraham Lincoln's reelection on November 8 and post-Civil War Republican dominance in Congress, as Nevada's mining-based economy tied it to the more industrialized Union."
12602,27,nevada,12602,"As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the election handily and did not need Nevada's help."
12603,27,nevada,12603,Nevada is one of only two states to significantly expand its borders after admission to the Union.
12604,27,nevada,12604,"(The other is Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the Platte Purchase.)"
12605,27,nevada,12605,"In 1866 another part of the western Utah Territory was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state, setting the current eastern boundary."
12606,27,nevada,12606,"Nevada achieved its current southern boundaries on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the portion of Pah-Ute County in the Arizona Territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of present-day Nevada south of the 37th parallel."
12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was prompted by the discovery of gold in the area, and officials thought Nevada would be better able to oversee the expected population boom."
12608,27,nevada,12608,This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12609,27,nevada,12609,Mining shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see Silver mining in Nevada).
12610,27,nevada,12610,"When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It, mining had led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth."
12611,27,nevada,12611,Both mining and population temporarily declined in the late 19th century.
12612,27,nevada,12612,"However, the rich silver strike at Tonopah in 1900, followed by strikes in Goldfield and Rhyolite, created a second mining boom in Nevada and Nevada's population."
12613,27,nevada,12613,Unregulated gambling was commonplace in the early Nevada mining towns but was outlawed in 1909 as part of a nationwide anti-gambling crusade.
12614,27,nevada,12614,"Because of subsequent declines in mining output and the decline of the agricultural sector during the Great Depression, Nevada again legalized gambling on March 19, 1931, with approval from the legislature."
12615,27,nevada,12615,Governor Fred B. Balzar's signature enacted the most liberal divorce laws in the country and open gambling.
12616,27,nevada,12616,The reforms came just eight days after the federal government presented the $49 million construction contract for Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam).
12617,27,nevada,12617,"The Nevada Test Site, 65 miles (105 km) northwest of the city of Las Vegas, was founded on January 11, 1951, for the testing of nuclear weapons."
12618,27,nevada,12618,"The site consists of about 1,350 square miles (3,500 km2) of the desert and mountainous terrain."
12619,27,nevada,12619,"Nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site began with a 1 kiloton of TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951."
12620,27,nevada,12620,"The last atmospheric test was conducted on July 17, 1962, and the underground testing of weapons continued until September 23, 1992."
12621,27,nevada,12621,The location is known for having the highest concentration of nuclear-detonated weapons in the US
12622,27,nevada,12622,Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government.
12623,27,nevada,12623,The primary reason for this is homesteads were not permitted in large enough sizes to be viable in the arid conditions that prevail throughout desert Nevada.
12624,27,nevada,12624,"Instead, early settlers would homestead land surrounding a water source, and then graze livestock on the adjacent public land, which is useless for agriculture without access to water (this pattern of ranching still prevails)."
12625,27,nevada,12625,"The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Nevada on July 1, 2019, was 3,080,156, an increase of 45,764 residents (1.51%) since the 2018 US Census estimate and an increase of 379,605 residents (14.06%) since the 2010 United States Census."
12626,27,nevada,12626,Nevada had the highest percentage growth in population from 2017 to 2018.
12627,27,nevada,12627,"At the 2010 Census, 6.9% of the state's population were reported as under 5, 24.6% were under 18, and 12.0% were 65 or older."
12628,27,nevada,12628,Females made up about 49.5% of the population.
12629,27,nevada,12629,"Since the 2010 census, the population of Nevada had a natural increase of 87,581 (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths); and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 (of which 104,032 was due to domestic and 42,594 was due to international migration)."
12630,27,nevada,12630,The center of population of Nevada is in southern Nye County.
12631,27,nevada,12631,"In this county, the unincorporated town of Pahrump, 60 miles (97 km) west of Las Vegas on the California state line, has grown very rapidly from 1980 to 2010."
12632,27,nevada,12632,"At the 2010 census, the town had 36,441 residents."
12633,27,nevada,12633,"Las Vegas grew from a gulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 by 1950 to 100,000 by 1970, and was America's fastest-growing city and metropolitan area from 1960 to 2000."
12634,27,nevada,12634,"From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the US percentage-wise."
12635,27,nevada,12635,"Between 1990 and 2000, Nevada's population increased by 66%, while the nation's population increased by 13%."
12636,27,nevada,12636,"More than two-thirds of the population live in Clark County, which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12637,27,nevada,12637,"Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation."
12638,27,nevada,12638,"Henderson and North Las Vegas are among the top 20 fastest-growing US cities with populations over 100,000."
12639,27,nevada,12639,The rural community of Mesquite 65 miles (105 km) northeast of Las Vegas was an example of micropolitan growth in the 1990s and 2000s.
12640,27,nevada,12640,Other desert towns like Indian Springs and Searchlight on the outskirts of Las Vegas have seen some growth as well.
12641,27,nevada,12641,"Since 1950, the rate of population born in Nevada has never peaked above 27 percent, the lowest rate of all states."
12642,27,nevada,12642,"In 2012, only 25% of Nevadans were born in-state."
12643,27,nevada,12643,"Most new residents in Nevada have moved from California, which has led a few Nevadans to feel their state is being ""Californicated""."
12644,27,nevada,12644,"According to the 2017 American Community Survey, 28.2% of Nevada's population were of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race): Mexican (21.4%), Puerto Rican (0.9%), Cuban (1.0%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (4.8%)."
12645,27,nevada,12645,"The five largest non-Hispanic White ancestry groups were: German (11.3%), Irish (9.0%), English (6.9%), Italian (5.8%), and American (4.7%)."
12646,27,nevada,12646,"In 1980, non-Hispanic whites made up 83.3% of the state's population."
12647,27,nevada,12647,"As of 2011, 63.6% of Nevada's population younger than age 1 were minorities."
12648,27,nevada,12648,Las Vegas is a minority majority city.
12649,27,nevada,12649,"According to the United States Census Bureau estimates, as of July 1, 2018, non-Hispanic Whites made up 48.7% of Nevada's population."
12650,27,nevada,12650,"In Douglas, Mineral, and Pershing counties, a plurality of residents are of Mexican ancestry."
12651,27,nevada,12651,"In Nye County and Humboldt County, residents are mostly of German ancestry; Washoe County has many Irish Americans."
12652,27,nevada,12652,"Americans of English descent form pluralities in Lincoln County, Churchill County, Lyon County, White Pine County, and Eureka County."
12653,27,nevada,12653,Asian Americans lived in the state since the California Gold Rush of the 1850s brought thousands of Chinese miners to Washoe county.
12654,27,nevada,12654,They were followed by a few hundred Japanese farmworkers in the late 19th century.
12655,27,nevada,12655,"By the late 20th century, many immigrants from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam came to the Las Vegas metropolitan area."
12656,27,nevada,12656,"The city now has one of America's most prolific Asian American communities, with a mostly Chinese and Taiwanese area known as ""Chinatown"" west of I-15 on Spring Mountain Road."
12657,27,nevada,12657,"Filipino Americans form the largest Asian American group in the state, with a population of more than 113,000."
12658,27,nevada,12658,They comprise 56.5% of the Asian American population in Nevada and constitute about 4.3% of the entire state's population.
12659,27,nevada,12659,Mining booms drew many Greek and Eastern European immigrants to Nevada.
12660,27,nevada,12660,"Native American tribes in Nevada are the Koso, Paiute, Panamint, Shoshoni, Walapi, Washoe and Ute tribes."
12661,27,nevada,12661,"The top countries of origin for immigrants in Nevada were Mexico (39.5 percent of immigrants), the Philippines (14.3 percent), El Salvador (5.2 percent), China (3.1 percent), and Cuba (3 percent)."
12662,27,nevada,12662,"Note: Births within the table do not add up, due to Hispanics being counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number."
12663,27,nevada,12663,A small percentage of Nevada's population lives in rural areas.
12664,27,nevada,12664,The culture of these places differs significantly from major metropolitan areas.
12665,27,nevada,12665,"People in these rural counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state."
12666,27,nevada,12666,The rural population is also less diverse in terms of race and ethnicity.
12667,27,nevada,12667,"Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent."
12668,27,nevada,12668,Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada.
12669,27,nevada,12669,Church attendance in Nevada is among the lowest of all US states.
12670,27,nevada,12670,"In a 2009 Gallup poll only 30% of Nevadans said they attended church weekly or almost weekly, compared to 42% of all Americans (only four states were found to have a lower attendance rate than Nevada's)."
12671,27,nevada,12671,"Major religious affiliations of the people of Nevada are: Protestant 35%, no religion 28%, Roman Catholic 25%, Latter-day Saint 4%, Jewish 2%, Hindu less than 1%, Buddhist 0.5% and Islam less than 0.1%."

12674,27,nevada,12674,The Jewish community is represented by The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute and Chabad.
12675,27,nevada,12675,"The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching."
12676,27,nevada,12676,"Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment."
12677,27,nevada,12677,The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates Nevada's total state product in 2018 was $170 billion.
12678,27,nevada,12678,"The state's per capita personal income in 2018 was $43,820, ranking 35th in the nation."
12679,27,nevada,12679,"Nevada's state debt in 2012 was calculated to be $7.5 billion, or $3,100 per taxpayer."
12680,27,nevada,12680,"As of December 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.8%."
12681,27,nevada,12681,The economy of Nevada has long been tied to vice industries.
12682,27,nevada,12682,"""[Nevada was] founded on mining and refounded on sin – beginning with prizefighting and easy divorce a century ago and later extending to gaming and prostitution"", said the August 21, 2010 issue of The Economist."
12683,27,nevada,12683,In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role.
12684,27,nevada,12684,"By value, gold is by far the most important mineral mined."
12685,27,nevada,12685,"In 2004, 6,800,000 ounces (190,000,000 g) of gold worth $2.84 billion were mined in Nevada, and the state accounted for 8.7% of world gold production (see Gold mining in Nevada)."
12686,27,nevada,12686,"Silver is a distant second, with 10,300,000 ounces (290,000,000 g) worth $69 million mined in 2004 (see Silver mining in Nevada)."
12687,27,nevada,12687,"Other minerals mined in Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite and lithium."
12688,27,nevada,12688,"Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high, and output is very sensitive to world commodity prices."
12689,27,nevada,12689,Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada.
12690,27,nevada,12690,"Nevada's agricultural outputs are cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions, and potatoes."
12691,27,nevada,12691,"As of January 1, 2006, there were an estimated 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada."
12692,27,nevada,12692,"Most of these animals forage on rangeland in the summer, with supplemental feed in the winter."
12693,27,nevada,12693,Calves are generally shipped to out-of-state feedlots in the fall to be fattened for the market.
12694,27,nevada,12694,"Over 90% of Nevada's 484,000 acres (196,000 ha) of cropland is used to grow hay, mostly alfalfa, for livestock feed."
12695,27,nevada,12695,"The largest employers in the state, as of the first fiscal quarter of 2011, are the following, according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation:"
12696,27,nevada,12696,"Amtrak's California Zephyr train uses the Union Pacific's original transcontinental railroad line in daily service from Chicago to Emeryville, California, serving Elko, Winnemucca, and Reno."
12697,27,nevada,12697,Las Vegas has had no passenger train service since Amtrak's Desert Wind was discontinued in 1997.
12698,27,nevada,12698,"Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provide connecting service from Las Vegas to trains at Needles, California, Los Angeles, and Bakersfield, California; and from Stateline, Nevada, to Sacramento, California."
12699,27,nevada,12699,There have been a number of proposals to re-introduce service to either Los Angeles or Southern California.
12700,27,nevada,12700,The Union Pacific Railroad has some railroads in the north and south of Nevada.
12701,27,nevada,12701,Greyhound Lines provide some bus service to the state.
12702,27,nevada,12702,"Interstate 15 (I-15) passes through the southern tip of the state, serving Las Vegas and other communities."
12703,27,nevada,12703,I-215 and I-515 also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12704,27,nevada,12704,"I-80 crosses through the northern part of Nevada, roughly following the path of the Humboldt River from Utah in the east and the Truckee River westward through Reno into California."
12705,27,nevada,12705,"It has a spur route, I-580."
12706,27,nevada,12706,"Nevada also is served by several US highways: US 6, US 50, US 93, US 95 and US 395."
12707,27,nevada,12707,There are also 189 Nevada state routes.
12708,27,nevada,12708,"Many of Nevada's counties have a system of county routes as well, though many are not signed or paved in rural areas."
12709,27,nevada,12709,Nevada is one of a few states in the US that do not have a continuous interstate highway linking its two major population centers – the road connection between the Las Vegas and Reno areas is a combination of several different Interstate and US highways.
12710,27,nevada,12710,The Interstate 11 proposed routing may eventually remedy this.
12711,27,nevada,12711,"The state is one of just a few in the country to allow semi-trailer trucks with three trailers – what might be called a ""road train"" in Australia."
12712,27,nevada,12712,"But American versions are usually smaller, in part because they must ascend and descend some fairly steep mountain passes."
12713,27,nevada,12713,RTC Transit is the public transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12714,27,nevada,12714,"The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a network of bus service across the Las Vegas Valley, including the use of The Deuce, double-decker buses, on the Las Vegas Strip and several outlying routes."
12715,27,nevada,12715,RTC RIDE operates a system of local transit bus service throughout the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area.
12716,27,nevada,12716,Other transit systems in the state include Carson City's JAC.
12717,27,nevada,12717,Most other counties in the state do not have public transportation at all.
12718,27,nevada,12718,"Additionally, a 4-mile (6.4 km) monorail system provides public transportation in the Las Vegas area."
12719,27,nevada,12719,"The Las Vegas Monorail line services several casino properties and the Las Vegas Convention Center on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip, running near Paradise Road, with a possible future extension to McCarran International Airport."
12720,27,nevada,12720,"Several hotels also run their own monorail lines between each other, which are typically several blocks in length."
12721,27,nevada,12721,McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is the busiest airport serving Nevada.
12722,27,nevada,12722,The Reno-Tahoe International Airport (formerly known as the Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the state.
12723,27,nevada,12723,Nevada has had a thriving solar energy sector.
12724,27,nevada,12724,An independent study in 2013 concluded that solar users created a $36 million net benefit.
12725,27,nevada,12725,"However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission let the state's only power company, NV Energy, charge higher rates and fees to solar panel users, leading to an immediate collapse of rooftop solar panel use"
12726,27,nevada,12726,"In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository as the only site to be characterized as a permanent repository for all of the nation's highly radioactive waste."
12727,27,nevada,12727,"Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Nevada government are divided among three separate departments: the executive consisting of the governor of Nevada and their cabinet along with the other elected constitutional officers; the legislative consisting of the Nevada Legislature, which includes the Assembly and the Senatorte; and the judicial consisting of the Supreme Court of Nevada and lower courts."
12728,27,nevada,12728,"The governor is the chief magistrate of Nevada, the head of the executive department of the state's government, and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces."
12729,27,nevada,12729,"The current governor is Steve Sisolak, a Democrat."
12730,27,nevada,12730,The Nevada Legislature is a bicameral body divided into an Assembly and Senatorte.
12731,27,nevada,12731,"Members of the Assembly serve two years, and members of the Senatorte serve four years."
12732,27,nevada,12732,"Both houses of the Nevada Legislature will be impacted by term limits starting in 2010, as senators and assemblymen/women will be limited to a maximum of twelve years in each house (by appointment or election which is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the constitution which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court of Nevada in a unanimous decision."
12733,27,nevada,12733,"Each session of the legislature meets for a constitutionally mandated 120 days in every odd-numbered year, or longer if the governor calls a special session."
12734,27,nevada,12734,"On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a female majority in its legislature."
12735,27,nevada,12735,"Women hold nine of the 21 seats in the Nevada Senatorte, and 23 of the 42 seats in the Nevada Assembly."
12736,27,nevada,12736,The Supreme Court of Nevada is the state supreme court and the head of the Nevada Judiciary.
12737,27,nevada,12737,"Original jurisdiction is divided between the district courts (with general jurisdiction), and justice courts and municipal courts (both of limited jurisdiction)."
12738,27,nevada,12738,"Appeals from District Courts are made directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which under a deflective model of jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the Court of Appeals for final resolution."
12739,27,nevada,12739,"Incorporated towns in Nevada, known as cities, are given the authority to legislate anything not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to permit home rule to incorporate Nevada cities to give them more flexibility and fewer restrictions from the Legislature.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"Town Boards for unincorporated towns are limited local governments created by either the local county commission, or by referendum, and form a purely advisory role and in no way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"In 1900, Nevada's population was the smallest of all states and was shrinking, as the difficulties of living in a ""barren desert"" began to outweigh the lure of silver for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743,Historian Lawrence Friedman has explained what happened next:
12744,27,nevada,12744,"With the advent of air conditioning for summertime use and Southern Nevada's mild winters, the fortunes of the state began to turn around, as it did for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growing in the Union."
12745,27,nevada,12745,Nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal – in a licensed brothel in a county which has specifically voted to permit it.
12746,27,nevada,12746,"It is illegal in larger jurisdictions such as Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), Washoe County (which contains Reno), and the independent city of Carson City."
12747,27,nevada,12747,"Nevada's early reputation as a ""divorce haven"" arose from the fact that before the no-fault divorce revolution in the 1970s, divorces were difficult to obtain in the United States."
12748,27,nevada,12748,"Already having legalized gambling and prostitution, Nevada continued the trend of boosting its profile by adopting one of the most liberal divorce statutes in the nation."
12749,27,nevada,12749,"This resulted in Williams v. North Carolina (1942), 317 US 287 (1942), in which the US Supreme Court ruled North Carolina had to give ""full faith and credit"" to a Nevada divorce."
12750,27,nevada,12750,"The Court modified its decision in Williams v. North Carolina (1945), 325 US 226 (1945), by holding a state need not recognize a Nevada divorce unless one of the parties was domiciled there at the time the divorce was granted and the forum state was entitled to make its own determination."
12751,27,nevada,12751,"As of 2009, Nevada's divorce rate was above the national average."
12752,27,nevada,12752,Nevada's tax laws are intended to draw new residents and businesses to the state.
12753,27,nevada,12753,Nevada has no personal income tax or corporate income tax.
12754,27,nevada,12754,"Since Nevada does not collect income data it cannot share such information with the federal government, the IRS."
12755,27,nevada,12755,The state sales tax (similar to VAT or GST) in Nevada is variable depending upon the county.
12756,27,nevada,12756,"The statewide tax rate is 6.85%, with five counties (Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, and Mineral) charging this amount."
12757,27,nevada,12757,"Counties may impose additional rates via voter approval or through approval of the state legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax varies by county from 6.85% to 8.375% (Clark County)."
12758,27,nevada,12758,"Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county option taxes in addition to the statewide rate: 0.25% for flood control, 0.50% for mass transit, 0.25% for infrastructure, and 0.25% for more cops."
12759,27,nevada,12759,"In Washoe County, which includes Reno, the sales tax rate is 7.725%, due to county option rates for flood control, the ReTRAC train trench project, and mass transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991."
12760,27,nevada,12760,"The minimum Nevada sales tax rate changed on July 1, 2009."
12761,27,nevada,12761,"The lodging tax rate in unincorporated Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas Strip, is 12%."
12762,27,nevada,12762,"Within the boundaries of the cities of Las Vegas and Henderson, the lodging tax rate is 13%."
12763,27,nevada,12763,Corporations such as Apple Inc. allegedly have set up investment companies and funds in Nevada to avoid paying taxes.
12764,27,nevada,12764,"In 2009, the Nevada Legislature passed a bill creating a domestic partnership registry which enables gay couples to enjoy the same rights as married couples."
12765,27,nevada,12765,"In June 2015, gay marriage became legal in Nevada."
12766,27,nevada,12766,"Nevada provides a friendly environment for the formation of corporations, and many (especially California) businesses have incorporated in Nevada to take advantage of the benefits of the Nevada statute."
12767,27,nevada,12767,Nevada corporations offer great flexibility to the Board of Directors and simplify or avoid many of the rules that are cumbersome to business managers in some other states.
12768,27,nevada,12768,"In addition, Nevada has no franchise tax, although it does require businesses to have a license for which the business has to pay the state."
12769,27,nevada,12769,"Similarly, many US states have usury laws limiting the amount of interest a lender can charge, but federal law allows corporations to 'import' these laws from their home state."
12770,27,nevada,12770,Nevada has very liberal alcohol laws.
12771,27,nevada,12771,"Bars are permitted to remain open 24 hours, with no ""last call""."
12772,27,nevada,12772,"Liquor stores, convenience stores and supermarkets may also sell alcohol 24 hours per day and may sell beer, wine and spirits."
12773,27,nevada,12773,"In 2016, Nevada voters approved Question 2, which legalized the possession, transportation and cultivation of personal use amounts of marijuana for adults age 21 years and older, and authorized the creation of a regulated market for the sale of marijuana to adults age 21 years and older through state-licensed retail outlets."
12774,27,nevada,12774,"Nevada voters had previously approved medical marijuana in 2000, but rejected marijuana legalization in a similar referendum in 2006."
12775,27,nevada,12775,Marijuana in all forms remains illegal under federal law.
12776,27,nevada,12776,"Aside from cannabis legalization, non-alcohol drug laws are a notable exception to Nevada's otherwise libertarian principles."
12777,27,nevada,12777,It is notable for having the harshest penalties for drug offenders in the country.
12778,27,nevada,12778,Nevada remains the only state to still use mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for possession of drugs.
12779,27,nevada,12779,"Nevada voters enacted a smoking ban (""The Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act"") in November 2006 which became effective on December 8, 2006."
12780,27,nevada,12780,It outlaws smoking in most workplaces and public places.
12781,27,nevada,12781,"Smoking is permitted in bars, but only if the bar serves no food, or the bar is inside a larger casino."
12782,27,nevada,12782,"Smoking is also permitted in casinos, certain hotel rooms, tobacco shops, and brothels."
12783,27,nevada,12783,"However, some businesses do not obey this law and the government tends not to enforce it."
12784,27,nevada,12784,"In 2011, smoking restrictions in Nevada were relaxed for certain places which allow only people 21 or older inside."
12785,27,nevada,12785,"In 2006, the crime rate in Nevada was about 24% higher than the national average rate, though crime has since decreased."
12786,27,nevada,12786,"Property crimes accounted for about 85% of the total crime rate in Nevada, which was 21% higher than the national rate."
12787,27,nevada,12787,The remaining 20.3% were violent crimes.
12788,27,nevada,12788,A complete listing of crime data in the state for 2013 can be found here:
12789,27,nevada,12789,"Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada."
12790,27,nevada,12790,"The north has long maintained control of key positions in state government, even while the population of southern Nevada is larger than the rest of the state combined."
12791,27,nevada,12791,The north sees the high population south becoming more influential and perhaps commanding majority rule.
12792,27,nevada,12792,"The south sees the north as the ""old guard"" trying to rule as an oligarchy."
12793,27,nevada,12793,"This has fostered some resentment, however, due to a term limit amendment passed by Nevada voters in 1994, and again in 1996, some of the north's hold over key positions will soon be forfeited to the south, leaving northern Nevada with less power."
12794,27,nevada,12794,"Historically, northern Nevada has been very Republican."
12795,27,nevada,12795,The more rural counties of the north are among the most conservative regions of the country.
12796,27,nevada,12796,"Carson City, the state's capital, is a Republican-leaning swing city/county."
12797,27,nevada,12797,"Washoe County, home to Reno, has historically been strongly Republican, but now has become more of a Democratic-leaning swing county."
12798,27,nevada,12798,"Clark County, home to Las Vegas, has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party since it was founded in 1909, having voted Republican only six times and once for a third-party candidate."
12799,27,nevada,12799,Clark and Washoe counties have long dominated the state's politics.
12800,27,nevada,12800,"Between them, they cast 87 percent of Nevada's vote, and elect a substantial majority of the state legislature."
12801,27,nevada,12801,The last Republican to carry Clark County was George H.W.
12802,27,nevada,12802,"Bush in 1988, and the last Republican to carry Washoe County was George W. Bush in 2004."
12803,27,nevada,12803,The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno.
12804,27,nevada,12804,"Nevada has voted for the winner in nearly every presidential election from 1912 to 2020, the only exceptions being 1976 when it voted for Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter and 2016 when the state was carried by Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump."
12805,27,nevada,12805,"This includes Nevada supporting Democrats John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960 and 1964, respectively."
12806,27,nevada,12806,"Republican Richard Nixon in 1968 and in 1972, Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980 and in 1984, Republican George H.W."
12807,27,nevada,12807,"Bush in 1988, Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, Republican George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, and Democrat Barack Obama winning the state in both 2008 and 2012, as well as Joe Biden in the 2020 election."
12808,27,nevada,12808,This gives the state status as a political bellwether.
12809,27,nevada,12809,"From 1912 to 2020, Nevada has been carried by the presidential victor the most out of any state (27 of 29 elections)."
12810,27,nevada,12810,"In 2016, Nevada lost its bellwether status briefly when it narrowly cast its votes for Hillary Clinton."
12811,27,nevada,12811,Nevada regained it when Biden won in 2020.
12812,27,nevada,12812,"Nevada has been carried by the winner of nearly every presidential election since its first in 1864, only being carried by the defeated candidate eight times since statehood."

13612,29,new_jersey,13612,"The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters."

13633,29,new_jersey,13633,"For many years in the past, however, it was a Republican stronghold, having given comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of 1948, 1968, and 1976."

13822,30,new_mexico,13822,"While Spanish was permitted in the legislature until 1935, all state officials are required to have a good knowledge of English."
13823,30,new_mexico,13823,Cobarrubias and Fishman therefore argue that New Mexico cannot be considered a bilingual state as not all laws are published in both languages.
13824,30,new_mexico,13824,"Others, such as Juan Perea, claim that the state was officially bilingual until 1953."

14209,31,new_york,14209,"Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890, when the federal government assumed control over immigration."
14210,31,new_york,14210,"During that period, more than eight million immigrants passed through its doors (two of every three US immigrants)."
14211,31,new_york,14211,"When the federal government assumed control, it established the Bureau of Immigration, which chose the three-acre Ellis Island in Upper New York Harbor for an entry depot."
14212,31,new_york,14212,"Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot."
14213,31,new_york,14213,"It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of Jersey City, New Jersey, via a short ferry ride."

14221,31,new_york,14221,"Ellis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it."
14222,31,new_york,14222,The issue was settled in 1998 by the US Supreme Court which ruled that the original 3.3-acre (1.3 ha) island was New York State territory and that the balance of the 27.5 acres (11 ha) added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.

14237,31,new_york,14237,The storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of New York City and Long Island to minimize the risk from another such future event.
14238,31,new_york,14238,Such risk is considered highly probable due to global warming and rising sea levels.

14600,32,north_carolina,14600,"The Native polities of the Mississippian culture fell apart and reformed as new groups, such as the Catawba, due to a series of destabilizing events known as the ""Mississippian shatter zone""."
14601,32,north_carolina,14601,"As described by anthropologist Robbie Ethridge, the Mississippian shatter zone was an area of great instability, in what is now the American South, caused by the instability of Mississippian chiefdoms, high mortality from new Eurasian diseases, construction of a global capitalistic economy based on trading of Native American slaves, and the emergence of Native ""militaristic slaving societies""."

14648,32,north_carolina,14648,"In 1788 Raleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks."
14649,32,north_carolina,14649,"Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the ""lost colony"" on Roanoke Island."
14650,32,north_carolina,14650,"The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania plus immigrants from abroad."
14651,32,north_carolina,14651,"Differences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western North Carolina, or the Tidewater and uplands, affected the political, economic, and social life of the state from the 18th until the 20th century."

14653,32,north_carolina,14653,"The upcountry of western North Carolina was settled chiefly by Scots-Irish, English, and German Protestants, the so-called ""cohee""."
14654,32,north_carolina,14654,"Arriving during the mid- to late 18th century, the Scots-Irish from what is today Northern Ireland were the largest non-English immigrant group before the Revolution; English indentured servants were overwhelmingly the largest immigrant group before the Revolution."
14655,32,north_carolina,14655,"During the American Revolutionary War, the English and Highland Scots of eastern North Carolina tended to remain loyal to the British Crown, because of longstanding business and personal connections with Great Britain."
14656,32,north_carolina,14656,"The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain."
14657,32,north_carolina,14657,"Most of the English colonists had arrived as indentured servants, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage."
14658,32,north_carolina,14658,In the early years the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid.
14659,32,north_carolina,14659,Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status.
14660,32,north_carolina,14660,Most of the free colored families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men.

14662,32,north_carolina,14662,Many had migrated or were descendants of migrants from colonial Virginia.
14663,32,north_carolina,14663,"As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in Great Britain, planters imported more slaves, and the state's legal delineations between free and slave status tightened, effectively hardening the latter into a racial caste."

14667,32,north_carolina,14667,"Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce guerrilla warfare erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists."
14668,32,north_carolina,14668,In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries.
14669,32,north_carolina,14669,"During the Revolutionary War, North Carolina had around 7,800 men join the Continental Army under General George Washington; and an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General Nathanael Greene."
14670,32,north_carolina,14670,"There was some military action, especially in 1780–81."
14671,32,north_carolina,14671,"Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the Washington District (later known as Tennessee), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands."
14672,32,north_carolina,14672,It ceded them to the national government so the Northwest Territory could be organized and managed nationally.
14673,32,north_carolina,14673,"A major American victory in the war took place at King's Mountain along the North Carolina–South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1,000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of Tennessee) and southwest Virginia overwhelmed a force of some 1,000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson."
14674,32,north_carolina,14674,"Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called ""Tories"" or Loyalists)."
14675,32,north_carolina,14675,"The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories."
14676,32,north_carolina,14676,The road to Yorktown and America's independence from Great Britain led through North Carolina.
14677,32,north_carolina,14677,"As the British Army moved north from victories in Charleston and Camden, South Carolina, the Southern Division of the Continental Army and local militia prepared to meet them."
14678,32,north_carolina,14678,"Following General Daniel Morgan's victory over the British Cavalry Commander Banastre Tarleton at the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781, southern commander Nathanael Greene led British Lord Charles Cornwallis across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina."

14680,32,north_carolina,14680,"In the Battle of Cowan's Ford, Cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the Catawba River at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, in an attempt to engage General Morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal."

14682,32,north_carolina,14682,"Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in present-day Greensboro on March 15, 1781."
14683,32,north_carolina,14683,"Although the British troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling."
14684,32,north_carolina,14684,"Following this ""Pyrrhic victory"", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the Royal Navy to protect his battered army."
14685,32,north_carolina,14685,"This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at Yorktown, Virginia, later in 1781."
14686,32,north_carolina,14686,The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence.
14687,32,north_carolina,14687,"On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the Constitution."
14688,32,north_carolina,14688,"After 1800, cotton and tobacco became important export crops."
14689,32,north_carolina,14689,"The eastern half of the state, especially the Tidewater region, developed a slave society based on a plantation system and slave labor."
14690,32,north_carolina,14690,"Besides slaves, there were a number of free people of color in the state."
14691,32,north_carolina,14691,Most were descendants from free African Americans who had migrated along with neighbors from Virginia during the 18th century.
14692,32,north_carolina,14692,"The majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women, indentured servants or free, and African men, indentured, slave or free."
14693,32,north_carolina,14693,"After the Revolution, Quakers and Mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves."
14694,32,north_carolina,14694,Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the Revolution to arrange for manumission of their slaves.
14695,32,north_carolina,14695,The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.
14696,32,north_carolina,14696,"Many free people of color migrated to the frontier, along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser."
14697,32,north_carolina,14697,"By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than 10,000."
14698,32,north_carolina,14698,"The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms."

14703,32,north_carolina,14703,Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina.
14704,32,north_carolina,14704,"They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding ""yeoman"" farmers of western North Carolina."
14705,32,north_carolina,14705,"In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a 129 mi (208 km) wooden plank road, known as a ""farmer's railroad"", from Fayetteville in the east to Bethania (northwest of Winston-Salem)."

14708,32,north_carolina,14708,"In 1849, the North Carolina Railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to Greensboro, High Point, and Charlotte."
14709,32,north_carolina,14709,"During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia."
14710,32,north_carolina,14710,"While slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population of 992,622, were enslaved African Americans."
14711,32,north_carolina,14711,They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern Tidewater.
14712,32,north_carolina,14712,"In addition, 30,463 free people of color lived in the state."
14713,32,north_carolina,14713,"They were also concentrated in the eastern coastal plain, especially at port cities such as Wilmington and New Bern, where a variety of jobs were available."
14714,32,north_carolina,14714,"The decades of tensions over issues of slavery, would lead to the main cause of the Civil War."
14715,32,north_carolina,14715,"North Carolina was known as a 'Slave State' by 1860, in which one-third of the population was enslaved."
14716,32,north_carolina,14716,This was a smaller proportion than in many other Southern states.
14717,32,north_carolina,14717,"The state did not vote to join the Confederacy until President Abraham Lincoln called on it to invade its sister state, South Carolina, becoming the last or penultimate state to officially join the Confederacy."
14718,32,north_carolina,14718,"The title of ""last to join the Confederacy"" has been disputed; although Tennessee's informal secession on May 7, 1861, preceded North Carolina's official secession on May 20, the Tennessee legislature did not formally vote to secede until June 8, 1861."
14719,32,north_carolina,14719,"Around 125,000 troops from North Carolina served in the Confederate Army, and about 15,000 North Carolina troops served in Union Army regiments, with many other men leaving the state to join Union regiments elsewhere."

15125,33,north_dakota,15125,The rivalry between the two new states presented a dilemma of which was to be admitted first.
15126,33,north_dakota,15126,Harrison directed Secretary of State James G. Blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first.
15127,33,north_dakota,15127,"The actual order went unrecorded, thus no one knows which of the Dakotas was admitted first."
15128,33,north_dakota,15128,"However, since North Dakota alphabetically appears before South Dakota, its proclamation was published first in the Statutes At Large."
15129,33,north_dakota,15129,"Unrest among wheat farmers, especially among Norwegian immigrants, led to a populist political movement centered in the Non Partisan League (""NPL"") around the time of World War I."
15130,33,north_dakota,15130,The NPL ran candidates on the Republican ticket (but merged into the Democratic Party after World War II).
15131,33,north_dakota,15131,It tried to insulate North Dakota from the power of out-of-state banks and corporations.
15132,33,north_dakota,15132,"In addition to founding the state-owned Bank of North Dakota and North Dakota Mill and Elevator (both still in existence), the NPL established a state-owned railroad line (later sold to the Soo Line Railroad)."
15133,33,north_dakota,15133,Anti-corporate laws virtually prohibited a corporation or bank from owning title to land zoned as farmland.
15134,33,north_dakota,15134,"These laws, still in force today, after having been upheld by state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to foreclose on farmland, as even after foreclosure, the property title cannot be held by a bank or mortgage company."
15135,33,north_dakota,15135,"Furthermore, the Bank of North Dakota, having powers similar to a Federal Reserve branch bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of subprime mortgages and their collateralization in the form of derivative instruments, and so prevented a collapse of housing prices within the state in the wake of 2008's financial crisis."

15139,33,north_dakota,15139,"Western North Dakota saw a boom in oil exploration in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as rising petroleum prices made development profitable."
15140,33,north_dakota,15140,This boom came to an end after petroleum prices declined.
15141,33,north_dakota,15141,"In recent years, the state has had lower rates of unemployment than the national average, and increased job and population growth."
15142,33,north_dakota,15142,Much of the growth has been based on development of the Bakken oil fields in the western part of the state.
15143,33,north_dakota,15143,"Estimates as to the remaining amount of oil in the area vary, with some estimating over 100 years' worth."
15144,33,north_dakota,15144,"For decades, North Dakota's annual murder rate and the violent crime rate was regularly the lowest in the United States."
15145,33,north_dakota,15145,"In recent years, however, while still below the national average, crime has risen sharply."
15146,33,north_dakota,15146,"In 2016, the violent crime rate was three times higher than in 2004, with the rise occurring mostly in the late 2000s, coinciding with the oil boom era."
15147,33,north_dakota,15147,This happened at a time when the national violent crime rate declined slightly.
15148,33,north_dakota,15148,Workers in the oil boom towns have been blamed for much of the increase.
15149,33,north_dakota,15149,"The United States Census Bureau estimates North Dakota's population was 762,062 on July 1, 2019, a 13.30% increase since the 2010 United States Census."

15151,33,north_dakota,15151,"North Dakota is the fourth least-populous state in the country; only Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming have fewer residents."
15152,33,north_dakota,15152,"From fewer than 2,000 people in 1870, North Dakota's population grew to near 680,000 by 1930."
15153,33,north_dakota,15153,"Growth then slowed, and the population has fluctuated slightly over the past seven decades, hitting a low of 617,761 in the 1970 census, with 642,200 in the 2000 census."
15154,33,north_dakota,15154,"Except for Native Americans, the North Dakota population has a lesser percentage of minorities than in the nation as a whole."

15158,33,north_dakota,15158,"Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century, North Dakota, along with most of the midwest, experienced a mass influx of newcomers from both the eastern United States and immigrants from Europe."
15159,33,north_dakota,15159,"North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom."
15160,33,north_dakota,15160,"Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the Red River Valley, as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota."
15161,33,north_dakota,15161,This area is well known for its fertile lands.
15162,33,north_dakota,15162,"By the outbreak of the First World War, this was among North America's richest farming regions."
15163,33,north_dakota,15163,"But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions."
15164,33,north_dakota,15164,Many family plots were too small to farm successfully.
15165,33,north_dakota,15165,"From the 1930s until the end of the 20th century, North Dakota's population gradually declined, interrupted by a couple of brief increases."
15166,33,north_dakota,15166,Young adults with university degrees were particularly likely to leave the state.
15167,33,north_dakota,15167,"With the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices, and environmental conditions requiring larger landholdings for successful agriculture, subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families."
15168,33,north_dakota,15168,Many people moved to urban areas for jobs.
15169,33,north_dakota,15169,"Since the late 20th century, one of the major causes of migration from North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates."
15170,33,north_dakota,15170,"Expansion of economic development programs has been urged to create skilled and high-tech jobs, but the effectiveness of such programs has been open to debate."
15171,33,north_dakota,15171,"During the first decade of the 21st century, the population increased in large part because of jobs in the oil industry related to development of tight oil (shale oil) fields."
15172,33,north_dakota,15172,"Elsewhere, the Native American population has increased as some reservations have attracted people back from urban areas."
15173,33,north_dakota,15173,Immigration
15174,33,north_dakota,15174,North Dakota is one of the top resettlement locations for refugees proportionally.

15176,33,north_dakota,15176,"In fiscal year 2014, 582 refugees settled in the state."
15177,33,north_dakota,15177,Fargo Mayor Mahoney said North Dakota accepting the most refugees per capita should be celebrated given the benefits they bring to the state.
15178,33,north_dakota,15178,"In 2015, Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota, the state's only resettlement agency, was ""awarded $458,090 in federal funding to improve refugee services""."

15180,33,north_dakota,15180,"Of the residents of North Dakota, 69.8% were born in North Dakota, 27.2% were born in a different state, 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, US Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 2.4% were born in another country."

15183,33,north_dakota,15183,"Throughout the mid-19th century, Dakota Territory was still dominated by Native Americans."
15184,33,north_dakota,15184,Warfare and disease reduced their population at the same time Europeans and Americans were settling in the state.
15185,33,north_dakota,15185,"In the 21st century, most North Dakotans are of Northern European descent."

15446,34,ohio,15446,Ohio has only that portion of the river between the river's 1792 low-water mark and the present high-water mark.

15473,34,ohio,15473,"This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's common wall lizard, one of the few examples of permanent ""subtropical"" fauna in Ohio."

16385,36,oregon,16385,"Because Oregon's state budget is written in two-year increments and, there being no sales tax, state revenue is based largely on income taxes, it is often significantly over- or under-budget."

16413,36,oregon,16413,"While Republicans typically win more counties by running up huge margins in the east, the Democratic tilt of the more populated west is usually enough to swing the entire state Democratic."

16421,36,oregon,16421,"More recently, 2004's Measure 37 reflects a backlash against such land-use laws."
16422,36,oregon,16422,"However, a further ballot measure in 2007, Measure 49, curtailed many of the provisions of 37."
16423,36,oregon,16423,"Of the measures placed on the ballot since 1902, the people have passed 99 of the 288 initiatives and 25 of the 61 referendums on the ballot, though not all of them survived challenges in courts (see Pierce v. Society of Sisters, for an example)."

17530,39,south_carolina,17530,"Also relevant are the state constitution, law enforcement agencies, federal representation, state finances, and state taxes."
17531,39,south_carolina,17531,South Carolina has historically had a weak executive branch and a strong legislature.
17532,39,south_carolina,17532,"Before 1865, governors in South Carolina were appointed by the General Assembly, and held the title ""President of State""."
17533,39,south_carolina,17533,"The 1865 Constitution changed this process, requiring a popular election."
17534,39,south_carolina,17534,Local governments were also weak.
17535,39,south_carolina,17535,"But, the 1867 Constitution, passed during the Reconstruction era, extended democratization by establishing home rule for counties, which were established from the formerly designated districts of the state."
17536,39,south_carolina,17536,"The 1895 state constitution overturned this, reducing the role of counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature; essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the General Assembly through the legislative delegation for each county."
17537,39,south_carolina,17537,They are geographically comprehensive
17538,39,south_carolina,17538,"As each county had one state senator, that position was particularly powerful."
17539,39,south_carolina,17539,"This status continued until 1973, when the state constitution was amended to provide for home rule for the counties."
17540,39,south_carolina,17540,"During this time the state had changed, with increasing urbanization, but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts."
17541,39,south_carolina,17541,"The federal court case, Reynolds v. Sims (1964), ""established the one-man, one-voteconcept for electoral representation at the state level."

17543,39,south_carolina,17543,Residents of urban areas had been found to be markedly underrepresented in the legislature under the county-based system.
17544,39,south_carolina,17544,"Reapportionment made obvious the need for other changes to county structure, leading to the legislature passing the constitutional amendment."
17545,39,south_carolina,17545,The Home Rule Act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties.
17546,39,south_carolina,17546,"With urbanization, their governments have become increasingly important in the state."

17577,39,south_carolina,17577,Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to other US colonies.
17578,39,south_carolina,17578,"The historian Alan Gallay says, ""the trade in Indian slaves was at the center of the English empire's development in the American South."

17604,39,south_carolina,17604,"Further, the state maintained indirect election of electors by the state legislature until 1868, the last state to do so."

17632,39,south_carolina,17632,"Until the 1868 presidential election, South Carolina's legislature, not the voters, chose the state's electors for the presidential election."

17640,39,south_carolina,17640,The state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the Populist and Agrarian movements of the 1890s.
17641,39,south_carolina,17641,A Republican-Populist biracial coalition took power away from White Democrats temporarily.
17642,39,south_carolina,17642,"To prevent that from happening again, Democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 which effectively disenfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes, residency, and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls."
17643,39,south_carolina,17643,"By 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls, although they constituted a majority of the state's population."
17644,39,south_carolina,17644,"The 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement: the 782,509 African American citizens comprised more than 58% of the state's population, but they were essentially without any political representation in the Jim Crow society."
17645,39,south_carolina,17645,"The 1895 constitution overturned local representative government, reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government, effectively ruled by the General Assembly, through the legislative delegations for each county."

17649,39,south_carolina,17649,"During the constitutional convention in 1895, he supported another man's proposal that the state adopt a one-drop rule, as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known African ancestry."
17650,39,south_carolina,17650,Some members of the convention realized prominent white families with some African ancestry could be affected by such legislation.
17651,39,south_carolina,17651,"In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal (which was dropped), George Dionysius Tillman said in opposition:"
17652,39,south_carolina,17652,The state postponed such a one-drop law for years.

17661,39,south_carolina,17661,The struggle of the civil rights movement took place in South Carolina as they did in other Southern states.
17662,39,south_carolina,17662,"However, South Carolina experienced a much less violent movement than other Southern states."
17663,39,south_carolina,17663,This tranquil transition from a Jim Crow society occurred because the state's white and black leaders were willing to accept slow change rather than being utterly unwilling to accept change at all.
17664,39,south_carolina,17664,"Other South Carolinians, like Senator Strom Thurmond, on the other hand, were among the nation's most radical and effective opponents of social equality and integration."
17665,39,south_carolina,17665,"As of 2015, South Carolina had one of the lowest percentages among all states of women in state legislature, at 13.5% (only Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Wyoming had a lower percentage; the national average is 24.3%; with the highest percentage being in Colorado at 41%)."

17668,39,south_carolina,17668,"South Carolina was one of the first states to stop paying for 'early elective' deliveries of babies, under either Medicaid and private insurance."
17669,39,south_carolina,17669,The term early elective is defined as a labor induction or Cesarean section between 37–39 weeks that is not medically based.
17670,39,south_carolina,17670,This change is intended to result in healthier babies and fewer unnecessary costs for South Carolina.
17671,39,south_carolina,17671,"On November 20, 2014, South Carolina became the 35th state to legalize same-sex marriages, when a federal court ordered the change."

18083,41,tennessee,18083,"Beginning during Reconstruction, it had competitive party politics, but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disenfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting."

18106,41,tennessee,18106,"Tennessee is known as The Volunteer State, a nickname some claimed was earned during the War of 1812 because of the prominent role played by volunteer soldiers from Tennessee, especially during the Battle of New Orleans."
18107,41,tennessee,18107,"Other sources differ on the origin of the state nickname; according to The Columbia Encyclopedia, the name refers to volunteers for the Mexican–American War from 1846 to 1848."
18108,41,tennessee,18108,"This explanation is more likely, because President Polk's call for 2,600 nationwide volunteers at the beginning of the Mexican–American War resulted in 30,000 volunteers from Tennessee alone, largely in response to the death of Davy Crockett and appeals by former Tennessee Governor and then Texas politician, Sam Houston."

18132,41,tennessee,18132,"Stretching west from the Blue Ridge for approximately 55 miles (89 km) is the Ridge and Valley region, in which numerous tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Tennessee Valley."
18133,41,tennessee,18133,"This area of Tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges, such as Bays Mountain and Clinch Mountain."
18134,41,tennessee,18134,"The western section of the Tennessee Valley, where the depressions become broader and the ridges become lower, is called the Great Valley."
18135,41,tennessee,18135,"In this valley are numerous towns and two of the region's three urban areas, Knoxville, the third largest city in the state, and Chattanooga, the fourth largest city in the state."
18136,41,tennessee,18136,"The third urban area, the Tri-Cities, comprising Bristol, Johnson City, and Kingsport and their environs, is located to the northeast of Knoxville."
18137,41,tennessee,18137,The Cumberland Plateau rises to the west of the Tennessee Valley
18138,41,tennessee,18138,"The elevation of the Cumberland Plateau ranges from 1,500 to about 2,000 feet (460 to about 610 m) above sea level."
18139,41,tennessee,18139,"East Tennessee has several important transportation links with Middle and West Tennessee, as well as the rest of the nation and the world, including several major airports and interstates."
18140,41,tennessee,18140,"Knoxville's McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) and Chattanooga's Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA), as well as the Tri-Cities' Tri-Cities Regional Airport (TRI), provide air service to numerous destinations."
18141,41,tennessee,18141,"I-24, I-81, I-40, I-75, and I-26 along with numerous state highways and other important roads, traverse the Grand Division and connect Chattanooga, Knoxville, and the Tri-Cities, along with other cities and towns such as Cleveland, Athens, and Sevierville."
18142,41,tennessee,18142,"West of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim, an elevated plain that surrounds the Nashville Basin."
18143,41,tennessee,18143,"The northern section of the Highland Rim, known for its high tobacco production, is sometimes called the Pennyroyal Plateau; it is located primarily in Southwestern Kentucky."
18144,41,tennessee,18144,"The Nashville Basin is characterized by rich, fertile farm country and great diversity of natural wildlife."
18145,41,tennessee,18145,Middle Tennessee was a common destination of settlers crossing the Appalachians from Virginia in the late 18th century and early 19th century.
18146,41,tennessee,18146,"An important trading route called the Natchez Trace, created and used for many generations by American Indians, connected Middle Tennessee to the lower Mississippi River town of Natchez."
18147,41,tennessee,18147,The route of the Natchez Trace was used as the basis for a scenic highway called the Natchez Trace Parkway.
18148,41,tennessee,18148,Some of the last remaining large American chestnut trees grow in this region.
18149,41,tennessee,18149,They are being used to help breed blight-resistant trees.
18150,41,tennessee,18150,Middle Tennessee is one of the primary state population and transportation centers along with the heart of state government.
18151,41,tennessee,18151,"Nashville (the capital), Clarksville, and Murfreesboro are its largest cities."
18152,41,tennessee,18152,"Interstates 24, 40, 65, and 840 service the Division, with the first three meeting in Nashville."
18153,41,tennessee,18153,"West of the Highland Rim and Nashville Basin is the Gulf Coastal Plain, which includes the Mississippi embayment."
18154,41,tennessee,18154,"The Gulf Coastal Plain is, in terms of area, the predominant land region in Tennessee."
18155,41,tennessee,18155,It is part of the large geographic land area that begins at the Gulf of Mexico and extends north into southern Illinois.
18156,41,tennessee,18156,"In Tennessee, the Gulf Coastal Plain is divided into three sections that extend from the Tennessee River in the east to the Mississippi River in the west."
18157,41,tennessee,18157,"The easternmost section, about 10 miles (16 km) in width, consists of hilly land that runs along the western bank of the Tennessee River."
18158,41,tennessee,18158,To the west of this narrow strip of land is a wide area of rolling hills and streams that stretches all the way to the Mississippi River
18159,41,tennessee,18159,"In Memphis, the Tennessee Bottoms end in steep bluffs overlooking the river."
18160,41,tennessee,18160,"To the west of the Tennessee Bottoms is the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, less than 300 feet (91 m) above sea level."
18161,41,tennessee,18161,"This area of lowlands, flood plains, and swamp land is sometimes referred to as the Delta region."
18162,41,tennessee,18162,Memphis is the economic center of West Tennessee.
18163,41,tennessee,18163,"Most of West Tennessee remained Indian land until the Chickasaw Cession of 1818, when the Chickasaw ceded their land between the Tennessee River and the Mississippi River."
18164,41,tennessee,18164,The portion of the Chickasaw Cession that lies in Kentucky is known today as the Jackson Purchase.
18165,41,tennessee,18165,Areas under the control and management of the National Park Service include the following:
18166,41,tennessee,18166,"Fifty-four state parks, covering some 132,000 acres (530 km2) as well as parts of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Cherokee National Forest, and Cumberland Gap National Historical Park are in Tennessee."
18167,41,tennessee,18167,"Sportsmen and visitors are attracted to Reelfoot Lake, originally formed by the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes; stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, together with the lotus bed covering the shallow waters, give the lake an eerie beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168,"Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a mountain temperate or humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in the climate of Tennessee, with winds from the south being responsible for most of the state's annual precipitation."
18170,41,tennessee,18170,"Generally, the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year, with highest average monthly precipitation generally in the winter and spring months, between December and April."
18171,41,tennessee,18171,"The driest months, on average, are August to October."
18172,41,tennessee,18172,On average the state receives 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation annually.
18173,41,tennessee,18173,Snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13 cm) in West Tennessee to over 80 inches (200 cm) in the highest mountains in East Tennessee.
18174,41,tennessee,18174,"Summers in the state are generally hot and humid, with most of the state averaging a high of around 90 °F (32 °C) during the summer months."
18175,41,tennessee,18175,"Winters tend to be mild to cool, increasing in coolness at higher elevations."
18176,41,tennessee,18176,"Generally, for areas outside the highest mountains, the average overnight lows are near freezing for most of the state."
18177,41,tennessee,18177,"The highest recorded temperature is 113 °F (45 °C) at Perryville on August 9, 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature is −32 °F (−36 °C) at Mountain City on December 30, 1917."
18178,41,tennessee,18178,"While the state is far enough from the coast to avoid any direct impact from a hurricane, the location of the state makes it likely to be impacted from the remnants of tropical cyclones which weaken over land and can cause significant rainfall, such as Tropical Storm Chris in 1982 and Hurricane Opal in 1995."
18179,41,tennessee,18179,"The state averages about fifty days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large hail and damaging winds."
18180,41,tennessee,18180,"Tornadoes are possible throughout the state, with West and Middle Tennessee the most vulnerable."
18181,41,tennessee,18181,"Occasionally, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating April 2011 tornadoes that killed twenty people in North Georgia and Southeast Tennessee."
18182,41,tennessee,18182,"On average, the state has 15 tornadoes per year."
18183,41,tennessee,18183,"Tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes which have fatalities."
18184,41,tennessee,18184,"Winter storms are an occasional problem, such as the infamous Blizzard of 1993, although ice storms are a more likely occurrence."
18185,41,tennessee,18185,"Fog is a persistent problem in parts of the state, especially in East Tennessee."
18186,41,tennessee,18186,"The capital and largest city is Nashville, though Knoxville, Kingston, and Murfreesboro have all served as state capitals in the past."
18187,41,tennessee,18187,Nashville's 13-county metropolitan area has been the state's largest since c. 1990.
18188,41,tennessee,18188,Memphis was the largest city in the state until 2018 when it was surpassed by Nashville.
18189,41,tennessee,18189,"Chattanooga and Knoxville, both in the east near the Great Smoky Mountains, are about a third that size."
18190,41,tennessee,18190,"The city of Clarksville is a fifth significant population center, 45 miles (72 km) northwest of Nashville."
18191,41,tennessee,18191,"Murfreesboro is the sixth-largest city in Tennessee, consisting of 146,900 residents."
18192,41,tennessee,18192,"The area now known as Tennessee was first inhabited by Paleo-Indians nearly 12,000 years ago."
18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area between first settlement and the time of European contact are unknown, but several distinct cultural phases have been named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC – 1000 AD), and Mississippian (1000–1600 AD), whose chiefdoms were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who inhabited the Tennessee River Valley before Cherokee migration into the river's headwaters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first recorded European excursions into what is now called Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559, and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo recorded the name ""Tanasqui"" from a local Indian village, which evolved to the state's current name."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,"At that time, Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Yuchi people."
18197,41,tennessee,18197,"Possibly because of European diseases devastating the Indian tribes, which would have left a population vacuum, and also from expanding European settlement in the north, the Cherokee moved south from the area now called Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European colonists spread into the area, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw, and ultimately, the Cherokee in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British settlement in what is now Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near present-day Vonore."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,Fort Loudoun became the westernmost British outpost to that date.
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard de Brahm and constructed by forces under British Captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202,"After its completion, Captain Raymond Demeré relinquished command on August 14, 1757, to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203,"Hostilities erupted between the British and the neighboring Overhill Cherokees, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with its surrender on August 7, 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The following morning, Captain Paul Demeré and a number of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of East and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began arriving late in the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,The majority of 18th century settlers were English or of primarily English descent but nearly 20% of them were also Scotch-Irish.
18207,41,tennessee,18207,"These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on lands leased from the Cherokee peoples."
18208,41,tennessee,18208,"During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycamore Shoals (in present-day Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his warring faction of Cherokee who were aligned with the British Loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209,These renegade Cherokee were referred to by settlers as the Chickamauga.
18210,41,tennessee,18210,They opposed North Carolina's annexation of the Washington District and the concurrent settling of the Transylvania Colony further north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The lives of many settlers were spared from the initial warrior attacks through the warnings of Dragging Canoe's cousin, Nancy Ward."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The frontier fort on the banks of the Watauga River later served as a 1780 staging area for the Overmountain Men in preparation to trek over the Appalachian Mountains, to engage, and to later defeat the British Army at the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213,Three counties of the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin.
18214,41,tennessee,18214,"Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (now numbering eight) had re-joined North Carolina by 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized into the Southwest Territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In an effort to encourage settlers to move west into the new territory, in 1787 the mother state of North Carolina ordered a road to be cut to take settlers into the Cumberland Settlements—from the south end of Clinch Mountain (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Avery's Trace"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Wilderness Road"" through the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,"Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796 as the 16th state."
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It was the first state created from territory under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government.
18220,41,tennessee,18220,"Apart from the former Thirteen Colonies only Vermont and Kentucky predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither was ever a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Article I, Section 31, states that the beginning point for identifying the boundary is the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, and basically runs the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Native American towns of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the state; all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition, referencing possible land trade with other states, or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As more white settlers moved into Tennessee, they came into increasing conflict with Native American tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224,"During the administration of US President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black people enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."
18225,41,tennessee,18225,"US troops forced them to march from ""emigration depots"" in Eastern Tennessee, such as Fort Cass, toward the more distant Indian Territory west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma."
18226,41,tennessee,18226,"During this relocation an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way west."
18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi,""the Trail Where We Cried""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Native Americans forced to emigrate as a result of the Indian removal efforts of the United States, and so the phrase ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indian peoples, especially among the ""Five Civilized Tribes""."
18229,41,tennessee,18229,The phrase originated as a description of the earlier emigration of the Choctaw nation.
18230,41,tennessee,18230,"In February 1861, secessionists in Tennessee's state government—led by Governor Isham Harris—sought voter approval for a convention to sever ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a 54–46% margin."
18231,41,tennessee,18231,"The strongest opposition to secession came from East Tennessee, which later tried to form a separate Union-aligned state."
18232,41,tennessee,18232,"Following the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's call for troops from Tennessee and other states in response, Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization, submitted an ordinance of secession to the General Assembly, and made direct overtures to the Confederate government."
18233,41,tennessee,18233,"The Tennessee legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States on May 7, 1861."
18234,41,tennessee,18234,"On June 8, 1861, with people in Middle Tennessee having significantly changed their position, voters approved a second referendum calling for secession, becoming the last state to do so."
18235,41,tennessee,18235,"But the Union-backing State of Scott was also established at this time, and remained a de facto enclave of the United States throughout the war."
18236,41,tennessee,18236,Many major battles of the American Civil War were fought in Tennessee—most of them Union victories.
18237,41,tennessee,18237,Ulysses S. Grant and the US Navy captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862.
18238,41,tennessee,18238,They held off the Confederate counterattack at Shiloh in April.
18239,41,tennessee,18239,"Memphis fell to the Union in June, following a naval battle on the Mississippi River in front of the city."
18240,41,tennessee,18240,The Capture of Memphis and Nashville gave the Union control of the western and middle sections.
18241,41,tennessee,18241,This control was confirmed at the Battle of Murfreesboro in early January 1863 and by the subsequent Tullahoma Campaign.
18242,41,tennessee,18242,"Despite the strength of Unionist sentiment in East Tennessee (with the exception of Sullivan County, which was heavily pro-Confederate), Confederates held the area."
18243,41,tennessee,18243,"The Confederates, led by General James Longstreet, did attack General Burnside's Fort Sanders at Knoxville and lost."
18244,41,tennessee,18244,"It was a big blow to East Tennessee Confederate momentum, but Longstreet won the Battle of Bean's Station a few weeks later."
18245,41,tennessee,18245,"The Confederates besieged Chattanooga during the Chattanooga Campaign in early fall 1863, but were driven off by Grant in November."
18246,41,tennessee,18246,"Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General Braxton Bragg, who led the Army of Tennessee from Perryville, Kentucky, to another Confederate defeat at Chattanooga."
18247,41,tennessee,18247,"The last major battles came when the Confederates invaded Middle Tennessee in November 1864 and were checked at Franklin, then completely dispersed by George Thomas at Nashville in December."
18248,41,tennessee,18248,"Meanwhile, President Abraham Lincoln appointed displaced senator and native Tennessean Andrew Johnson military governor of the state."
18249,41,tennessee,18249,"When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, Tennessee was largely held by Union forces."
18250,41,tennessee,18250,"Thus it was not among the states enumerated in the Proclamation, and the Proclamation did not free any slaves there."
18251,41,tennessee,18251,"Nonetheless, enslaved African Americans escaped to Union lines to gain freedom without waiting for official action."
18252,41,tennessee,18252,"Old and young, men, women, and children camped near Union troops."
18253,41,tennessee,18253,"Thousands of former slaves ended up fighting on the Union side, nearly 200,000 in total across the South."
18254,41,tennessee,18254,"Tennessee's legislature approved an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting slavery on February 22, 1865."
18255,41,tennessee,18255,Voters in the state approved the amendment in March.
18256,41,tennessee,18256,"It also ratified the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (abolishing slavery in every state) on April 7, 1865."
18257,41,tennessee,18257,"In 1864, Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat from Tennessee, was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln."
18258,41,tennessee,18258,He became President after Lincoln's assassination in 1865.
18259,41,tennessee,18259,"Under Johnson's lenient re-admission policy, Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the US Congress, on July 24, 1866."
18260,41,tennessee,18260,"Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period."
18261,41,tennessee,18261,"After the formal end of Reconstruction, the struggle over power in Southern society continued."
18262,41,tennessee,18262,"Through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their allies, White Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other states across the South in the late 1870s and 1880s."
18263,41,tennessee,18263,"Over the next decade, the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control African Americans."
18264,41,tennessee,18264,"In 1889 the General Assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform, with the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most African Americans in rural areas and small towns, as well as many poor Whites."
18265,41,tennessee,18265,"Legislation included implementation of a poll tax, timing of registration, and recording requirements."
18266,41,tennessee,18266,Tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades into the 20th century.
18267,41,tennessee,18267,"Disfranchising legislation accompanied Jim Crow laws passed in the late 19th century, which imposed segregation in the state."
18268,41,tennessee,18268,"In 1900, African Americans made up nearly 24% of the state's population, and numbered 480,430 citizens who lived mostly in the central and western parts of the state."
18269,41,tennessee,18269,"In 1897, Tennessee celebrated its centennial of statehood (though one year late of the 1896 anniversary) with a great exposition in Nashville."
18270,41,tennessee,18270,"A full-scale replica of the Parthenon was constructed for the celebration, located in what is now Nashville's Centennial Park."
18271,41,tennessee,18271,"On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the thirty-sixth and final state necessary to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provided women the right to vote."
18272,41,tennessee,18272,"Disenfranchising voter registration requirements continued to keep most African Americans and many poor whites, both men and women, off the voter rolls."
18273,41,tennessee,18273,"The need to create work for the unemployed during the Great Depression, a desire for rural electrification, the need to control annual spring flooding and improve shipping capacity on the Tennessee River were all factors that drove the federal creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1933."
18274,41,tennessee,18274,"Through the power of the TVA projects, Tennessee quickly became the nation's largest public utility supplier."
18275,41,tennessee,18275,"During World War II, the availability of abundant TVA electrical power led the Manhattan Project to locate one of the principal sites for production and isolation of weapons-grade fissile material in East Tennessee."
18276,41,tennessee,18276,The planned community of Oak Ridge was built from scratch to provide accommodations for the facilities and workers.
18277,41,tennessee,18277,"These sites are now Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Y-12 National Security Complex, and the East Tennessee Technology Park."
18278,41,tennessee,18278,"Despite recognized effects of limiting voting by poor whites, successive legislatures expanded the reach of the disfranchising laws until they covered the state."
18279,41,tennessee,18279,Political scientist V. O.
18280,41,tennessee,18280,"Key, Jr. argued in 1949:"
18281,41,tennessee,18281,"In 1953 state legislators amended the state constitution, removing the poll tax."
18282,41,tennessee,18282,"In many areas both blacks and poor whites still faced subjectively applied barriers to voter registration that did not end until after passage of national civil rights legislation, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965."
18283,41,tennessee,18283,Tennessee celebrated its bicentennial in 1996.
18284,41,tennessee,18284,"With a yearlong statewide celebration entitled ""Tennessee 200"", it opened a new state park (Bicentennial Mall) at the foot of Capitol Hill in Nashville."

18436,41,tennessee,18436,I-24 is an east–west interstate that runs from Chattanooga to Clarksville.
18437,41,tennessee,18437,"In a north–south orientation are highways I-55, I-65, I-75, and I-81."
18438,41,tennessee,18438,"Interstate 65 crosses the state through Nashville, while Interstate 75 serves Chattanooga and Knoxville and Interstate 55 serves Memphis."
18439,41,tennessee,18439,Interstate 81 enters the state at Bristol and terminates at its junction with I-40 near Dandridge.
18440,41,tennessee,18440,I-155 is a branch highway from I-55.
18441,41,tennessee,18441,"The only spur highway of I-75 in Tennessee is I-275, which is in Knoxville."
18442,41,tennessee,18442,"An extension of I-69 is proposed to travel through the western part of the state, from South Fulton to Memphis."
18443,41,tennessee,18443,"A branch interstate, I-269 also exists from Millington to Collierville."
18444,41,tennessee,18444,"Major airports within the state include Memphis International Airport (MEM), Nashville International Airport (BNA), McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) outside of Knoxville in Blount County, Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA), Tri-Cities Regional Airport (TRI), and McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport (MKL), in Jackson."
18445,41,tennessee,18445,"Because Memphis International Airport is the major hub for FedEx Corporation, it is the world's largest air cargo operation."
18446,41,tennessee,18446,"For passenger rail service, Memphis and Newbern, are served by the Amtrak City of New Orleans line on its run between Chicago, Illinois, and New Orleans, Louisiana."
18447,41,tennessee,18447,Nashville is served by the Music City Star commuter rail service.
18448,41,tennessee,18448,"Cargo services in Tennessee are primarily served by CSX Transportation, which has a hump yard in Nashville called Radnor Yard."
18449,41,tennessee,18449,"Norfolk Southern Railway operates lines in East Tennessee, through cities including Knoxville and Chattanooga, and operates a classification yard near Knoxville, the John Sevier Yard."
18450,41,tennessee,18450,BNSF operates a major intermodal facility in Memphis.
18451,41,tennessee,18451,"Similar to the United States Federal Government, Tennessee's government has three parts."
18452,41,tennessee,18452,"The Executive Branch is led by Tennessee's governor, who holds office for a four-year term and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms."
18453,41,tennessee,18453,The governor is the only official who is elected statewide.
18454,41,tennessee,18454,"Unlike most states, the state does not elect the lieutenant governor directly; the Tennessee Senatorte elects its Speaker, who serves as lieutenant governor."
18455,41,tennessee,18455,"The governor is supported by 22 cabinet-level departments, most headed by a commissioner who serves at the pleasure of the governor:"
18456,41,tennessee,18456,"The Executive Branch also includes several agencies, boards and commissions, some of which are under the auspices of one of the cabinet-level departments."
18457,41,tennessee,18457,"The bicameral Legislative Branch, known as the Tennessee General Assembly, consists of the 33-member Senatorte and the 99-member House of Representatives."
18458,41,tennessee,18458,"Senatortors serve four-year terms, and House members serve two-year terms."
18459,41,tennessee,18459,Each chamber chooses its own speaker.
18460,41,tennessee,18460,The speaker of the state Senatorte also holds the title of lieutenant governor.
18461,41,tennessee,18461,Constitutional officials in the legislative branch are elected by a joint session of the legislature.
18462,41,tennessee,18462,The highest court in Tennessee is the state Supreme Court.
18463,41,tennessee,18463,It has a chief justice and four associate justices.
18464,41,tennessee,18464,No more than two justices can be from the same Grand Division.
18465,41,tennessee,18465,"The Supreme Court of Tennessee also appoints the Attorney General, a practice not found in any of the other 49 states."
18466,41,tennessee,18466,Both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals have 12 judges.
18467,41,tennessee,18467,"A number of local, circuit, and federal courts provide judicial services."
18468,41,tennessee,18468,Tennessee's current state constitution was adopted in 1870.
18469,41,tennessee,18469,The state had two earlier constitutions.
18470,41,tennessee,18470,"The first was adopted in 1796, the year Tennessee joined the union, and the second was adopted in 1834."
18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution outlaws martial law within its jurisdiction.
18472,41,tennessee,18472,This may be a result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by Union (Northern) forces of the US government after the American Civil War.
18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee politics, like that of most US states, are dominated by the Republican and the Democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474,"Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state to the period of the American Civil War; for decades afterward, the eastern third of the state was heavily Republican and the western two thirds mostly voted Democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475,"This division was related to the state's pattern of farming, plantations and slaveholding."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern section was made up of yeoman farmers, but Middle and West Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton which were dependent on the use of slave labor."
18477,41,tennessee,18477,These areas became defined as Democratic after the war.
18478,41,tennessee,18478,"During Reconstruction, freedmen and former free people of color were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party."
18479,41,tennessee,18479,"Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office."
18480,41,tennessee,18480,"Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics, but in the 1880s, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration."
18481,41,tennessee,18481,"These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in state and local politics was markedly reduced."
18482,41,tennessee,18482,"In 1900 African Americans comprised 23.8 percent of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and West Tennessee."
18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of commission government for cities based on at-large voting for a few positions on a Board of Commission; several cities adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,In 1913 the state legislature enacted a bill enabling cities to adopt this structure without legislative approval.
18485,41,tennessee,18485,"After disenfranchisement of blacks, the Republican Party in Tennessee became a primarily white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, except for two nationwide Republican landslides of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee narrowly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio Governor James Cox, and in 1928, when it more decisively voted for Herbert Hoover over New York Governor Al Smith), the state was part of the Democratic Solid South until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In that postwar decade, it twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during World War II."
18488,41,tennessee,18488,"Since then, more of the state's voters have shifted to supporting Republicans, and Democratic presidential candidates have carried Tennessee only four times."
18489,41,tennessee,18489,By 1960 African Americans comprised 16.45% of the state's population.
18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was not until after the mid-1960s and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new devices, such as at-large commission city governments, had been adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491,Former Gov.
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former US Senator Bill Brock wins in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among whites for the statewide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493,Tennessee has selected governors from different parties since 1970.
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"In the early 21st century, Republican voters control most of the state, especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter area includes a large African-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496,"Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498,Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans (or their antecedents) have held it for all but four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The second has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1859.
18501,41,tennessee,18501,"In the 2000 presidential election, Vice President Al Gore, a Democratic US"
18502,41,tennessee,18502,"Senatortor from Tennessee, failed to carry his home state, an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503,"Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, with his margin of victory in the state increasing from 4% in 2000 to 14% in 2004."
18504,41,tennessee,18504,"Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton, usually fare better than their Northern counterparts do in Tennessee, especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas."
18505,41,tennessee,18505,"Tennessee sends nine members to the US House of Representatives, of whom there are seven Republicans and two Democrats."
18506,41,tennessee,18506,Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey is the first Republican speaker of the state Senatorte in 140 years.
18507,41,tennessee,18507,"In the 2008 elections, the Republican party gained control of both houses of the Tennessee state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction."
18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, some 30% of the state's electorate identified as independents."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"The Baker v. Carr (1962) decision of the US Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one vote"", requiring state legislatures to redistrict to bring Congressional apportionment in line with decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,It also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties.
18511,41,tennessee,18511,This case arose out of a lawsuit challenging the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512,"After decades in which urban populations had been underrepresented in many state legislatures, this significant ruling led to an increased (and proportional) prominence in state politics by urban and, eventually, suburban, legislators and statewide officeholders in relation to their population within the state."
18513,41,tennessee,18513,"The ruling also applied to numerous other states long controlled by rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont, and Montana."
18514,41,tennessee,18514,"The state of Tennessee maintains four dedicated law enforcement entities: the Tennessee Highway Patrol, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC)."
18515,41,tennessee,18515,The Highway Patrol is the primary law enforcement entity that concentrates on highway safety regulations and general non-wildlife state law enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the Tennessee Department of Safety.
18516,41,tennessee,18516,"The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife, boating, and fisheries regulations outside of state parks."
18517,41,tennessee,18517,The TBI maintains state-of-the-art investigative facilities and is the primary state-level criminal investigative department.
18518,41,tennessee,18518,Tennessee State Park Rangers are responsible for all activities and law enforcement inside the Tennessee State Parks system.
18519,41,tennessee,18519,Local law enforcement is divided between County Sheriff's Offices and Municipal Police Departments.
18520,41,tennessee,18520,Tennessee's Constitution requires that each County have an elected Sheriff.
18521,41,tennessee,18521,In 94 of the 95 counties the Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the county and has jurisdiction over the county as a whole.
18522,41,tennessee,18522,"Each Sheriff's Office is responsible for warrant service, court security, jail operations and primary law enforcement in the unincorporated areas of a county as well as providing support to the municipal police departments."
18523,41,tennessee,18523,Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police department to provide police services within their corporate limits.
18524,41,tennessee,18524,The three counties in Tennessee to adopt metropolitan governments have taken different approaches to resolving the conflict that a Metro government presents to the requirement to have an elected Sheriff.
18525,41,tennessee,18525,"Gun laws in Tennessee regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition."
18526,41,tennessee,18526,Concealed carry and open-carry of a handgun is permitted with a Tennessee handgun carry permit or an equivalent permit from a reciprocating state.
18527,41,tennessee,18527,"As of July 1, 2014, a permit is no longer required to possess a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle."
18528,41,tennessee,18528,Capital punishment has existed in Tennessee at various times since statehood.
18529,41,tennessee,18529,"Before 1913, the method of execution was hanging."
18530,41,tennessee,18530,"From 1913 to 1915, there was a hiatus on executions but they were reinstated in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531,"From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (Furman v. Georgia) capital punishment unconstitutional, there were no further executions."
18532,41,tennessee,18532,"Capital punishment was restarted in 1978, although those prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 had their sentences mostly commuted to life in prison."
18533,41,tennessee,18533,From 1916 to 1960 the state executed 125 inmates.
18534,41,tennessee,18534,For a variety of reasons there were no further executions until 2000.
18535,41,tennessee,18535,"Since 2000, Tennessee has executed seven prisoners."
18536,41,tennessee,18536,Tennessee has 59 prisoners on death row (as of October 2018).
18537,41,tennessee,18537,"Lethal injection was approved by the legislature in 1998, though those who were sentenced to death before January 1, 1999, may request electrocution."
18538,41,tennessee,18538,"In May 2014, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a law allowing the use of the electric chair for death row executions when lethal injection drugs are not available."
18539,41,tennessee,18539,The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is the only federally recognized Native American Indian tribe in the state.
18540,41,tennessee,18540,"It owns 79 acres (32 ha) in Henning, which was placed into federal trust by the tribe in 2012."
18541,41,tennessee,18541,This is governed directly by the tribe.
18542,41,tennessee,18542,"Tennessee has a rich variety of public, private, charter, and specialized education facilities ranging from pre-school through university."
18543,41,tennessee,18543,"In 2015, state legislators began efforts on the ""Drive to 55"" movement, which plans to increase the number of college-educated residents to at least 55% of the state's population."
18544,41,tennessee,18544,Then Governor Bill Haslam signed legislation that started the Tennessee Promise program.
18545,41,tennessee,18545,"Tennessee Promise, if students meet its requirements, allows in-state high school graduates to enroll in two-year post-secondary education programs such as associate's degrees and certificates at community colleges and trade schools in Tennessee tuition-free, funded by the state lottery."
18546,41,tennessee,18546,Public higher education is under the oversight of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission which provides guidance to two public university systems—the University of Tennessee system and the Tennessee Board of Regents.
18547,41,tennessee,18547,In addition a number of private colleges and universities are located throughout the state.
18548,41,tennessee,18548,"Public primary and secondary education systems are operated by county, city, or special school districts to provide education at the local level."
18549,41,tennessee,18549,These school districts operate under the direction of the Tennessee Department of Education.
18550,41,tennessee,18550,Private schools are found in many counties.
18551,41,tennessee,18551,"Over 250 public and private museums are located in Tennessee, including renowned museums such as the Brooks Museum, Pink Palace Museum and Planetarium, Country Music Hall of Fame, and Discovery Park of America."
18552,41,tennessee,18552,"State symbols, found in Tennessee Code Annotated; Title 4, Chapter 1, Part 3, include:"
18553,42,texas,18553,"Texas (, also locally ; Spanish: Texas or Tejas, pronounced [ˈtexas] (listen)) is a state in the South Central Region of the United States."
18554,42,texas,18554,It is the second largest US state by both area (after Alaska) and population (after California).
18555,42,texas,18555,"Texas shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest, and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast."
18556,42,texas,18556,"Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth largest in the US, while San Antonio is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the US Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country, respectively."
18557,42,texas,18557,"Other major cities include Austin, the second-most populous state capital in the US, and El Paso."
18558,42,texas,18558,"Texas is nicknamed the ""Lone Star State"" for its former status as an independent republic, and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico."
18559,42,texas,18559,"The ""Lone Star"" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal."
18560,42,texas,18560,"The origin of Texas's name is from the word táyshaʼ, which means ""friends"" in the Caddo language."
18561,42,texas,18561,"Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the US Southern and the Southwestern regions."
18562,42,texas,18562,"Although Texas is popularly associated with the US southwestern deserts, less than ten percent of Texas's land area is desert."
18563,42,texas,18563,"Most of the population centers are in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline."
18564,42,texas,18564,"Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend."
18565,42,texas,18565,"The term ""six flags over Texas"" refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory."
18566,42,texas,18566,Spain was the first European country to claim and control the area of Texas.
18567,42,texas,18567,France held a short-lived colony.
18568,42,texas,18568,"Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming the Republic of Texas."
18569,42,texas,18569,"In 1845, Texas joined the union as the 28th state."
18570,42,texas,18570,The state's annexation set off a chain of events that led to the Mexican–American War in 1846.
18571,42,texas,18571,"A slave state before the American Civil War, Texas declared its secession from the US in early 1861, and officially joined the Confederate States of America on March 2 of the same year."
18572,42,texas,18572,"After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation."
18573,42,texas,18573,"Historically four major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil."
18574,42,texas,18574,"Before and after the US Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy."
18575,42,texas,18575,In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative.
18576,42,texas,18576,"It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century."
18577,42,texas,18577,Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century.
18578,42,texas,18578,"As of 2015, it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54."
18579,42,texas,18579,"With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including tourism, agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences."

18581,42,texas,18581,"If Texas were a sovereign state, it would have the 10th largest economy in the world."
18582,42,texas,18582,"The name Texas, based on the Caddo word táyshaʼ (/tʼajʃaʔ/) ""friend"", was applied, in the spelling Tejas or Texas, by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves, specifically the Hasinai Confederacy, the final -s representing the Spanish plural.The Mission San Francisco de los Tejas was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in May 1690, in what is now Houston County, East Texas."
18583,42,texas,18583,"During Spanish colonial rule, in the 18th century, the area was known as Nuevas Filipinas (""New Philippines"") and Nuevo Reino de Filipinas (""New Kingdom of the Philippines""), or as provincia de los Tejas (""province of the Tejas""), later also provincia de Texas (or de Tejas), (""province of Texas"").It was incorporated as provincia de Texas into the Mexican Empire in 1821, and declared a republic in 1836."

18597,42,texas,18597,"By the time the region came to be explored, it belonged to the fairly well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century."

18601,42,texas,18601,"The name Texas derives from táyshaʔ, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, which means ""friends"" or ""allies""."
18602,42,texas,18602,"The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution."
18603,42,texas,18603,"They were not particularly kind to their native populations—even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604,"When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605,"After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance."
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land."
18608,42,texas,18608,"Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it, the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609,"They included the Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential."
18610,42,texas,18610,Whether a Native American tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land.
18611,42,texas,18611,"Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game."
18612,42,texas,18612,Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers.

18615,42,texas,18615,"At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread."
18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans were always clueless when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties—preferably on the side of the Spanish.
18618,42,texas,18618,"While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the US government trying to keep them in check."

18620,42,texas,18620,"By the 1830s, the US had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears."

18622,42,texas,18622,This included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18623,42,texas,18623,"Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their Native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements."

18797,42,texas,18797,Texas is in the south central part of the United States of America.
18798,42,texas,18798,Three of its borders are defined by rivers.
18799,42,texas,18799,"The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south."
18800,42,texas,18800,The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north.
18801,42,texas,18801,The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east.
18802,42,texas,18802,"The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a northern border with Oklahoma at 36°30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso lies on the state's western tip at 32° N and the Rio Grande."
18803,42,texas,18803,"With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions, regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and plant and animal communities."
18804,42,texas,18804,"One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province."
18805,42,texas,18805,The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state.
18806,42,texas,18806,Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods.
18807,42,texas,18807,The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest.
18808,42,texas,18808,The Cross Timbers region and Caprock Escarpment are part of the Interior Lowlands.
18809,42,texas,18809,The Great Plains region in central Texas spans through the state's panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state's hill country near Austin.
18810,42,texas,18810,This region is dominated by prairie and steppe.
18811,42,texas,18811,"""Far West Texas"" or the ""Trans-Pecos"" region is the state's Basin and Range Province."
18812,42,texas,18812,"The most varied of the regions, this area includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands."
18813,42,texas,18813,"Texas has 3,700 named streams and 15 major rivers, with the Rio Grande as the largest."
18814,42,texas,18814,"Other major rivers include the Pecos, the Brazos, Colorado, and Red River."

18816,42,texas,18816,"The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both."
18817,42,texas,18817,"The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States."
18818,42,texas,18818,"Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of the Deep South, to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest."
18819,42,texas,18819,"Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico."
18820,42,texas,18820,The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico.
18821,42,texas,18821,"The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old."
18822,42,texas,18822,"These Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso."
18823,42,texas,18823,Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks.
18824,42,texas,18824,"The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time."
18825,42,texas,18825,This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea.
18826,42,texas,18826,This is the buried crest of the Appalachian Mountains–Ouachita Mountains zone of Pennsylvanian continental collision.
18827,42,texas,18827,This orogenic crest is today buried beneath the Dallas–Waco–Austin–San Antonio trend.
18828,42,texas,18828,The late Paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in the Jurassic period began to open the Gulf of Mexico.
18829,42,texas,18829,"Pangea began to break up in the Triassic, but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and late Jurassic."
18830,42,texas,18830,The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form.
18831,42,texas,18831,Today 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are here.
18832,42,texas,18832,"At the start of its formation, the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age."
18833,42,texas,18833,"These salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs, and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast."
18834,42,texas,18834,East Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite.
18835,42,texas,18835,"The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north; Permian sediments in the west; and Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf contain oil."
18836,42,texas,18836,Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area.
18837,42,texas,18837,A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer.
18838,42,texas,18838,"Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes."
18839,42,texas,18839,A wide range of animals and insects live in Texas.
18840,42,texas,18840,"It is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all."
18841,42,texas,18841,At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas.
18842,42,texas,18842,"Texas plays host to several species of wasps, including an abundance of Polistes exclamans, and is an important ground for the study of Polistes annularis."
18843,42,texas,18843,"During the spring Texas wildflowers such as the state flower, the bluebonnet, line highways throughout Texas."
18844,42,texas,18844,"During the Johnson Administration the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, worked to draw attention to Texas wildflowers."
18845,42,texas,18845,The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather.
18846,42,texas,18846,"The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters."
18847,42,texas,18847,Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns.
18848,42,texas,18848,"El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual rainfall, while parts of southeast Texas average as much as 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year."
18849,42,texas,18849,Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches (940 mm) per year.
18850,42,texas,18850,"Snow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas, once or twice a year in North Texas, and once every few years in Central and East Texas."
18851,42,texas,18851,Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances.
18852,42,texas,18852,"Of note is the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm, when 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average high temperature in December is 65 °F."
18853,42,texas,18853,"Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s °F (26 °C) in the mountains of West Texas and on Galveston Island to around 100 °F (38 °C) in the Rio Grande Valley, but most areas of Texas see consistent summer high temperatures in the 90 °F (32 °C) range."
18854,42,texas,18854,Night-time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s °F (14 °C) in the West Texas mountains to 80 °F (27 °C) in Galveston.

18861,42,texas,18861,Some of the most destructive hurricanes in US history have impacted Texas.
18862,42,texas,18862,"A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town."
18863,42,texas,18863,These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city.
18864,42,texas,18864,"The 1900 Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city, killing about 8,000 people or possibly as many as 12,000."
18865,42,texas,18865,This makes it the deadliest natural disaster in US history.
18866,42,texas,18866,"In 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Rockport as a Category 4 Hurricane, causing significant damage there."
18867,42,texas,18867,"The storm stalled over land for a very long time, allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain over the Greater Houston area and surrounding counties."
18868,42,texas,18868,The result was widespread and catastrophic flooding that inundated hundreds of thousands of homes.
18869,42,texas,18869,"Harvey ultimately became the costliest hurricane worldwide, causing an estimated $198.6 billion in damage, surpassing the cost of Hurricane Katrina."
18870,42,texas,18870,"Other devastating Texas hurricanes include the 1915 Galveston hurricane, Hurricane Audrey in 1957 which killed more than 600 people, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005, and Hurricane Ike in 2008."
18871,42,texas,18871,"Tropical storms have also caused their share of damage: Allison in 1989 and again during 2001, and Claudette in 1979 among them."
18872,42,texas,18872,"As of 2017 Texas emits the most greenhouse gases in the US almost twice the amount of California, the second most polluting state.As of 2017 the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide annually."
18873,42,texas,18873,"As an independent nation, Texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases."
18874,42,texas,18874,Causes of the state's vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state's large number of coal power plants and the state's refining and manufacturing industries.
18875,42,texas,18875,"In 2010, there were 2,553 ""emission events"" which poured 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tons) of contaminants into the Texas sky."

18884,42,texas,18884,Houston and Dallas have been recognized as world cities.
18885,42,texas,18885,These cities are spread out amongst the state.

19250,42,texas,19250,"As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the GOP, which now more closely reflected their beliefs."
19251,42,texas,19251,"Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s."

19437,43,utah,19437,Utah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts with sand dunes to thriving pine forests in mountain valleys.
19438,43,utah,19438,"It is a rugged and geographically diverse state at the convergence of three distinct geological regions: the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau."
19439,43,utah,19439,"Utah covers an area of 84,899 sq mi (219,890 km2)."
19440,43,utah,19440,"It is one of the Four Corners states and is bordered by Idaho in the north, Wyoming in the north and east; by Colorado in the east; at a single point by New Mexico to the southeast; by Arizona in the south; and by Nevada in the west."
19441,43,utah,19441,"Only three US states (Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming) have exclusively latitude and longitude lines as boundaries."
19442,43,utah,19442,One of Utah's defining characteristics is the variety of its terrain.
19443,43,utah,19443,"Running down the middle of the state's northern third is the Wasatch Range, which rises to heights of almost 12,000 ft (3,700 m) above sea level."
19444,43,utah,19444,"Utah is home to world-renowned ski resorts made popular by light, fluffy snow and winter storms that regularly dump up to three feet of it overnight."
19445,43,utah,19445,"In the state's northeastern section, running east to west, are the Uinta Mountains, which rise to heights of over 13,000 feet (4,000 m)."
19446,43,utah,19446,"The highest point in the state, Kings Peak, at 13,528 feet (4,123 m), lies within the Uinta Mountains."
19447,43,utah,19447,"At the western base of the Wasatch Range is the Wasatch Front, a series of valleys and basins that are home to the most populous parts of the state."
19448,43,utah,19448,It stretches approximately from Brigham City at the north end to Nephi at the south end.
19449,43,utah,19449,"Approximately 75 percent of the state's population lives in this corridor, and population growth is rapid."
19450,43,utah,19450,Western Utah is mostly arid desert with a basin and range topography.
19451,43,utah,19451,Small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape.
19452,43,utah,19452,"The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being comparatively flat as a result of once forming the bed of ancient Lake Bonneville."
19453,43,utah,19453,"Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake, which once covered most of the eastern Great Basin."
19454,43,utah,19454,"West of the Great Salt Lake, stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid Great Salt Lake Desert."
19455,43,utah,19455,"One exception to this aridity is Snake Valley, which is (relatively) lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from groundwater derived from snow melt in the Snake Range, Deep Creek Range, and other tall mountains to the west of Snake Valley."
19456,43,utah,19456,Great Basin National Park is just over the Nevada state line in the southern Snake Range.
19457,43,utah,19457,"One of western Utah's most impressive, but least visited attractions is Notch Peak, the tallest limestone cliff in North America, located west of Delta."
19458,43,utah,19458,"Much of the scenic southern and southeastern landscape (specifically the Colorado Plateau region) is sandstone, specifically Kayenta sandstone and Navajo sandstone."
19459,43,utah,19459,"The Colorado River and its tributaries wind their way through the sandstone, creating some of the world's most striking and wild terrain (the area around the confluence of the Colorado and Green Rivers was the last to be mapped in the lower 48 United States)."
19460,43,utah,19460,Wind and rain have also sculpted the soft sandstone over millions of years.
19461,43,utah,19461,"Canyons, gullies, arches, pinnacles, buttes, bluffs, and mesas are the common sight throughout south-central and southeast Utah."
19462,43,utah,19462,"This terrain is the central feature of protected state and federal parks such as Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion national parks, Cedar Breaks, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Hovenweep, and Natural Bridges national monuments, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (site of the popular tourist destination, Lake Powell), Dead Horse Point and Goblin Valley state parks, and Monument Valley."
19463,43,utah,19463,The Navajo Nation also extends into southeastern Utah.
19464,43,utah,19464,"Southeastern Utah is also punctuated by the remote, but lofty La Sal, Abajo, and Henry mountain ranges."
19465,43,utah,19465,"Eastern (northern quarter) Utah is a high-elevation area covered mostly by plateaus and basins, particularly the Tavaputs Plateau and San Rafael Swell, which remain mostly inaccessible, and the Uinta Basin, where the majority of eastern Utah's population lives."
19466,43,utah,19466,"Economies are dominated by mining, oil shale, oil, and natural gas-drilling, ranching, and recreation."
19467,43,utah,19467,Much of eastern Utah is part of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation.
19468,43,utah,19468,The most popular destination within northeastern Utah is Dinosaur National Monument near Vernal.
19469,43,utah,19469,Southwestern Utah is the lowest and hottest spot in Utah.

19473,43,utah,19473,"Dixie is quickly becoming a popular recreational and retirement destination, and the population is growing rapidly."
19474,43,utah,19474,"Although the Wasatch Mountains end at Mount Nebo near Nephi, a complex series of mountain ranges extends south from the southern end of the range down the spine of Utah."
19475,43,utah,19475,"Just north of Dixie and east of Cedar City is the state's highest ski resort, Brian Head."
19476,43,utah,19476,"Like most of the western and southwestern states, the federal government owns much of the land in Utah."
19477,43,utah,19477,"Over 70 percent of the land is either BLM land, Utah State Trustland, or US National Forest, US National Park, US National Monument, National Recreation Area or US Wilderness Area."
19478,43,utah,19478,Utah is the only state where every county contains some national forest.
19479,43,utah,19479,"Utah features a dry, semi-arid to desert climate, although its many mountains feature a large variety of climates, with the highest points in the Uinta Mountains being above the timberline."
19480,43,utah,19480,The dry weather is a result of the state's location in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada in California.
19481,43,utah,19481,The eastern half of the state lies in the rain shadow of the Wasatch Mountains.
19482,43,utah,19482,"The primary source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually lying in the path of large Pacific storms from October to May."
19483,43,utah,19483,"In summer, the state, especially southern and eastern Utah, lies in the path of monsoon moisture from the Gulf of California."
19484,43,utah,19484,"Most of the lowland areas receive less than 12 inches (305 mm) of precipitation annually, although the I-15 corridor, including the densely populated Wasatch Front, receives approximately 15 inches (381 mm)."
19485,43,utah,19485,"The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest area of the state, with less than 5 inches (127 mm)."
19486,43,utah,19486,Snowfall is common in all but the far southern valleys.
19487,43,utah,19487,"Although St. George receives only about 3 inches (76 mm) per year, Salt Lake City sees about 60 inches (1,524 mm), enhanced by the lake-effect snow from the Great Salt Lake, which increases snowfall totals to the south, southeast, and east of the lake."
19488,43,utah,19488,"Some areas of the Wasatch Range in the path of the lake-effect receive up to 500 inches (12,700 mm) per year."
19489,43,utah,19489,This micro climate of enhanced snowfall from the Great Salt Lake spans the entire proximity of the lake.
19490,43,utah,19490,The cottonwood canyons adjacent to Salt Lake City are located in the right position to receive more precipitation from the lake.
19491,43,utah,19491,"The consistently deep powder snow led Utah's ski industry to adopt the slogan ""the Greatest Snow on Earth"" in the 1980s."
19492,43,utah,19492,"In the winter, temperature inversions are a common phenomenon across Utah's low basins and valleys, leading to thick haze and fog that can last for weeks at a time, especially in the Uintah Basin."
19493,43,utah,19493,"Although at other times of year its air quality is good, winter inversions give Salt Lake City some of the worst wintertime pollution in the country."
19494,43,utah,19494,Previous studies have indicated a widespread decline in snowpack over Utah accompanied by a decline in the snow–precipitation ratio while anecdotal evidence claims have been put forward that measured changes in Utah's snowpack are spurious and do not reflect actual change.
19495,43,utah,19495,"A 2012 study found that the proportion of winter (January–March) precipitation falling as snow has decreased by nine percent during the last half century, a combined result from a significant increase in rainfall and a minor decrease in snowfall."
19496,43,utah,19496,"Meanwhile, observed snow depth across Utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo."
19497,43,utah,19497,Weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.
19498,43,utah,19498,"Utah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation, and very hot summers statewide (with the exception of mountain areas and high mountain valleys)."
19499,43,utah,19499,"Utah is usually protected from major blasts of cold air by mountains lying north and east of the state, although major Arctic blasts can occasionally reach the state."
19500,43,utah,19500,Average January high temperatures range from around 30 °F (−1 °C) in some northern valleys to almost 55 °F (13 °C) in St. George.
19501,43,utah,19501,"Temperatures dropping below 0 °F (−18 °C) should be expected on occasion in most areas of the state most years, although some areas see it often (for example, the town of Randolph averages about fifty days per year with temperatures that low)."
19502,43,utah,19502,"In July, average highs range from about 85 to 100 °F (29 to 38 °C)."
19503,43,utah,19503,"However, the low humidity and high elevation typically leads to large temperature variations, leading to cool nights most summer days."
19504,43,utah,19504,"The record high temperature in Utah was 118 °F (48 °C), recorded south of St. George on July 4, 2007, and the record low was −69 °F (−56 °C), recorded at Peter Sinks in the Bear River Mountains of northern Utah on February 1, 1985."
19505,43,utah,19505,"However, the record low for an inhabited location is −49 °F (−45 °C) at Woodruff on December 12, 1932."
19506,43,utah,19506,"Utah, like most of the western United States, has few days of thunderstorms."
19507,43,utah,19507,"On average there are fewer than 40 days of thunderstorm activity during the year, although these storms can be briefly intense when they do occur."
19508,43,utah,19508,"They are most likely to occur during monsoon season from about mid-July through mid-September, especially in southern and eastern Utah."
19509,43,utah,19509,"Dry lightning strikes and the general dry weather often spark wildfires in summer, while intense thunderstorms can lead to flash flooding, especially in the rugged terrain of southern Utah."
19510,43,utah,19510,"Although spring is the wettest season in northern Utah, late summer is the wettest period for much of the south and east of the state."
19511,43,utah,19511,"Tornadoes are uncommon in Utah, with an average of two striking the state yearly, rarely higher than EF1 intensity."
19512,43,utah,19512,"One exception of note, however, was the unprecedented F2 Salt Lake City Tornado which moved directly across downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999, killing one person, injuring sixty others, and causing approximately $170 million in damage."
19513,43,utah,19513,"The only other reported tornado fatality in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on July 6, 1884."
19514,43,utah,19514,"The last tornado of above (E)F0 intensity occurred on September 8, 2002, when an F2 tornado hit Manti."
19515,43,utah,19515,"On August 11, 1993, an F3 tornado hit the Uinta Mountains north of Duchesne at an elevation of 10,500 feet (3,200 m), causing some damage to a Boy Scouts campsite."

19522,43,utah,19522,There are many different insects found in Utah.
19523,43,utah,19523,"One of the most rare is the Coral Pink Sand Dunes tiger beetle, found only in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, near Kanab."
19524,43,utah,19524,"It was proposed in 2012 to be listed as a threatened species, but the proposal was not accepted."

19531,43,utah,19531,"Much of the population lives in cities and towns along the Wasatch Front, a metropolitan region that runs north–south with the Wasatch Mountains rising on the eastern side."
19532,43,utah,19532,Growth outside the Wasatch Front is also increasing.
19533,43,utah,19533,"The St. George metropolitan area is currently the second fastest-growing in the country after the Las Vegas metropolitan area, while the Heber micropolitan area is also the second fastest-growing in the country (behind Palm Coast, Florida)."

19843,44,vermont,19843,"Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern Highlands, the Green Mountains, the Taconic Mountains, the Champlain Lowlands, and the Vermont Piedmont."
19844,44,vermont,19844,"About 500 million years ago, Vermont was part of Laurentia and located in the tropics."
19845,44,vermont,19845,"The central and southern Green Mountain range include the oldest rocks in Vermont, formed about one billion years ago during the first mountain building period (or orogeny)."
19846,44,vermont,19846,"Subsequently, about 400 million years ago, the second mountain building period created Green Mountain peaks that were 15,000–20,000 feet (4,600–6,100 m) tall, three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas."
19847,44,vermont,19847,"The geological pressures that created those peaks remain evident as the Champlain Thrust, running north–south to the west of the mountains (now the eastern shore of Lake Champlain)."
19848,44,vermont,19848,It is an example of geological fault thrusting where bedrock is pushed over the newer rock formation.
19849,44,vermont,19849,"As a result of tectonic formation, Vermont east of the Green Mountains tends to be formed from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods, and western Vermont mainly from the older Pre-Cambrian and Cambrian material."

19854,44,vermont,19854,"At one point, Vermont is believed to have been connected to Africa (Pangaea); the fossils found and the rock formations found on the coasts in both Africa and America are evidence affirming the Pangaea theory."
19855,44,vermont,19855,"In the past four centuries, Vermont has experienced a few earthquakes, rarely centered under the state."
19856,44,vermont,19856,"The highest ranked, in 1952, had a Richter magnitude scale 6.0 and was based in Canada."
19857,44,vermont,19857,"The state contains 41 species of reptiles and amphibians, 89 species of fish, of which 12 are non native; 193 species of breeding birds, 58 species of mammals, more than 15,000 insect species, and 2,000 higher plant species, plus fungi, algae, and 75 different types of natural communities."
19858,44,vermont,19858,"Vermont contains one species of venomous snake, the timber rattlesnake, which is confined to a few acres in western Rutland County."

19860,44,vermont,19860,"By the mid-19th century, wild turkeys were exterminated in the state through overhunting and destruction of habitat."
19861,44,vermont,19861,"Sixteen were re-introduced in 1969, and had grown to a flock estimated to number 45,000 in 2009."
19862,44,vermont,19862,"In 2013, hunters killed 6,968 of these."
19863,44,vermont,19863,"Since 1970, reduction of farmland has resulted in reduced environment for, and resulted in a decline in numbers of various shrubland birds, including the American woodcock, brown thrasher, eastern towhee, willow flycatcher, golden-winged warbler, blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and Baltimore oriole."
19864,44,vermont,19864,The use of DDT for insect control resulted in ospreys laying eggs that were too thin to support the development of young.
19865,44,vermont,19865,This species disappeared from the state.
19866,44,vermont,19866,"It began to reappear in 1998, when ospreys were observed again locally."
19867,44,vermont,19867,"As of 2010, they were no longer endangered in the state."
19868,44,vermont,19868,"From 2008 to 2010, White-nose syndrome killed an estimated two-thirds of all cave-wintering bats in the state."
19869,44,vermont,19869,"The New England cottontail disappeared from the state in the early 1970s, out-competed by the eastern cottontail rabbit, imported in the 1800s for hunting."
19870,44,vermont,19870,It is better able to detect and avoid predators.
19871,44,vermont,19871,"Out of a total of 33 species of bumblebee, by 2013 the number declined to 19 or 20 species in the state."
19872,44,vermont,19872,"Bombus terricola (the yellow-banded bumblebee), although once common in Vermont, has not been seen in most of its range since 1999 and is now absent from the state."
19873,44,vermont,19873,"For honey bees, colony collapse disorder has affected bee population in the state, as elsewhere."
19874,44,vermont,19874,"Invasive species included the Asian spotted-wing drosophila, which started damaging berry crops in 2012."
19875,44,vermont,19875,Vermont was the initial point of invasion in New England.
19876,44,vermont,19876,"Since 2010, the Vermont Department of Health has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct blood serum surveys of the state's deer and moose populations."
19877,44,vermont,19877,Tests for eastern equine encephalitis virus antibodies were positive in moose or deer in each of Vermont's counties.
19878,44,vermont,19878,"In 2012, 12% of deer and 2.4% of moose tested positive."
19879,44,vermont,19879,Vermont is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome.
19880,44,vermont,19880,"Much of the state, in particular the Green Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests."

19882,44,vermont,19882,The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak.
19883,44,vermont,19883,"Invasive wild honeysuckle has been deemed a threat to the state's forests, native species of plants, and wildlife."
19884,44,vermont,19884,"Many of Vermont's rivers, including the Winooski River, have been subjected to man-made barriers to prevent flooding."
19885,44,vermont,19885,Climate change appears to be affecting the maple sugar industry.
19886,44,vermont,19886,"Sugar maples have been subject to stress by acid rain, asian longhorn beetles, and pear thrips."
19887,44,vermont,19887,"In 2011 the deer herd had grown too large for habitat, and many resorted to eating bark to survive the winter, destroying trees in the process."
19888,44,vermont,19888,"In addition, the sugar maples need a certain period of cold to produce sap for maple syrup."
19889,44,vermont,19889,The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years.
19890,44,vermont,19890,"The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples, in effect forcing the sugar maples to ""migrate"" north to Canada."
19891,44,vermont,19891,"Between 8500 and 7000 BCE, at the time of the Champlain Sea, Native Americans inhabited and hunted in present-day Vermont."
19892,44,vermont,19892,"During the Archaic period, from the 8th millennium BCE to 1000 BCE, Native Americans migrated year-round."
19893,44,vermont,19893,"During the Woodland period, from 1000 BCE to 1600 CE, they established villages and trade networks, and developed ceramic and bow and arrow technology."
19894,44,vermont,19894,"Their population in 1500 CE was estimated to be around 10,000 people."
19895,44,vermont,19895,"During colonial times, where encounters and settlement were initiated by French colonists, the territory was occupied mainly by an Abenaki tribe known as the Sokoki, or Missisquois."
19896,44,vermont,19896,The eastern part of the state may have also been occupied by the Androscoggin and Pennacook peoples.
19897,44,vermont,19897,"To the west, the Missisquois competed with the Iroquoian Mohawk, based in the Mohawk valley but with a large territory, and the Algonquin Mohican peoples."
19898,44,vermont,19898,Many of the tribes later formed the Wabanaki Confederacy during King Philip's War.
19899,44,vermont,19899,The warfare by English colonists defeated and scattered most of the surviving Abenaki tribes.
19900,44,vermont,19900,The first European to see Vermont is thought to have been French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1535.
19901,44,vermont,19901,"On July 30, 1609, French explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed this territory as part of New France."

19905,44,vermont,19905,"In 1690, a group of Dutch-British settlers from Albany established a settlement and trading post at Chimney Point, 8 miles (13 km) west of present-day Addison."
19906,44,vermont,19906,"During Dummer's War, the first permanent English settlement was established in 1724 with the construction of Fort Dummer."
19907,44,vermont,19907,It was intended to protect the nearby settlements of Dummerston and Brattleboro.
19908,44,vermont,19908,"From 1731 to 1734, the French constructed Fort St. Frédéric, which gave them control of the New France–Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley."
19909,44,vermont,19909,"With the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, the North American front of the Seven Years' War between the French and British, the French began construction in 1755 of Fort Carillon at present-day Ticonderoga, New York."
19910,44,vermont,19910,The British failed to take either fort between 1755 and 1758.
19911,44,vermont,19911,"In 1759 a combined force of 12,000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir Jeffery Amherst captured Carillon, after which the French abandoned Fort St. Frédéric."

19914,44,vermont,19914,"The Crown attempted to limit colonial settlement to lands east of the Appalachians, in order to prohibit encroachment on Native American lands."
19915,44,vermont,19915,The territory of Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog.
19916,44,vermont,19916,"With the end of the war, new settlers arrived in Vermont."
19917,44,vermont,19917,"Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area."
19918,44,vermont,19918,"On July 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts, and south of 45 degrees north latitude."
19919,44,vermont,19919,New York refused to recognize the land titles known as the New Hampshire Grants (towns created by land grants sold by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth) and dissatisfied New Hampshire settlers organized in opposition.
19920,44,vermont,19920,"In 1770 Ethan Allen, his brothers Ira and Levi, and the Allens' cousins Seth Warner and Remember Baker, recruited an informal militia known as the Green Mountain Boys to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against newcomers from New York."

19930,44,vermont,19930,"This was the first written constitution in North America to ban adult slavery, saying male slaves become free at the age of 21 and females at 18."
19931,44,vermont,19931,It provided for universal adult male suffrage and required support of public schools.
19932,44,vermont,19932,It was in effect from 1777 to 1786.
19933,44,vermont,19933,"The Battle of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont and the United States."

19936,44,vermont,19936,"General Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6,000-man force at Saratoga, New York, on October 17 that year."
19937,44,vermont,19937,The battles of Bennington and Saratoga together are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army.

19944,44,vermont,19944,"Because the state of New York continued to assert a disputed claim that Vermont was a part of New York, Vermont could not be admitted to the Union under Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution until the legislature of New York consented."
19945,44,vermont,19945,"On March 6, 1790, the legislature made its consent contingent upon a negotiated agreement on the precise boundary between the two states."
19946,44,vermont,19946,"When commissioners from New York and Vermont met to decide on the boundary, Vermont's negotiators insisted on also settling the property ownership disputes with New Yorkers, rather than leaving that to be decided later in a federal court."
19947,44,vermont,19947,"The negotiations were successfully concluded in October 1790 with an agreement that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New York to be distributed among New Yorkers who claimed land in Vermont under New York land patents."

19965,44,vermont,19965,"As English speakers came to dominate the population in Vermont, they anglicized the names of many ethnic French residents and often discriminated against them."
19966,44,vermont,19966,"In the mid-20th century, descendants began to reclaim their French names, especially surnames."
19967,44,vermont,19967,"Beginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont industries attracted numerous Irish, Scots-Irish and Italian immigrants, adding to its residents of mostly English and some French-Canadian ancestry."
19968,44,vermont,19968,"Many of the immigrants migrated to Barre, where the men worked as stonecutters of granite, for which there was a national market."
19969,44,vermont,19969,Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states.
19970,44,vermont,19970,"In this period, many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses to support their families."
19971,44,vermont,19971,Such facilities also helped absorb new residents and help them learn the new culture
19972,44,vermont,19972,"Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others."
19973,44,vermont,19973,Gradually the new immigrants were absorbed into the state.
19974,44,vermont,19974,Times of tension aroused divisions.
19975,44,vermont,19975,"In the early 20th century, some people in Vermont became alarmed about what they considered to be a decline in rural areas; people left farming to move to cities and others seemed unable to fit within society."
19976,44,vermont,19976,"In addition, there was a wave of immigration by French Canadians, and those of Protestant Yankee stock feared being overtaken by the new people, who added to the Catholic population of Irish and Italians."
19977,44,vermont,19977,"Based on the colonial past, some Yankee residents considered the French Canadians to have intermarried too frequently with Native Americans."
19978,44,vermont,19978,"In an era influenced by ideas of Social Darwinism, some Vermont leaders promoted eugenics, an idea that the population could be managed and improved by limiting marriage and reproduction by certain members classified as unfit or defective."
19979,44,vermont,19979,"It passed a marriage law, to limit marriage by people considered unfit."

19981,44,vermont,19981,The state followed efforts to improve children's welfare by establishing other institutions to house the mentally ill or disabled.
19982,44,vermont,19982,From 1925 to 1928 the Eugenics Survey of Vermont conducted research and recorded the histories of families it determined were degenerate or dependent.
19983,44,vermont,19983,"It also attempted to educate the public about why restrictive measures, including voluntary sterilization, were desirable."
19984,44,vermont,19984,"Review by current historians reveals the results were socially prejudiced, as the surveys tended to target the poor and disenfranchised minorities, including French Canadians, Abenaki, and disabled."
19985,44,vermont,19985,In 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law.
19986,44,vermont,19986,"Vermont like other states, sterilized some patients in institutions and persons it had identified through surveys as degenerate or unfit."
19987,44,vermont,19987,"It nominally had permission from the patients or their guardians, but abuses have been documented."
19988,44,vermont,19988,"Two-thirds of the sterilizations were done on women, and poor, unwed mothers were targeted, among others."
19989,44,vermont,19989,The surgery was performed at institutions and hospitals in the state supposedly devoted to care of people in need.
19990,44,vermont,19990,"There is disagreement about how many sterilizations were performed; most were completed from 1931 to 1941, but such procedures were recorded as late as 1970."
19991,44,vermont,19991,"In addition to the increased intensity and flooding caused by climate change, the state has suffered several extreme natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes, and extensive rain and flooding."
19992,44,vermont,19992,Large-scale flooding occurred in early November 1927.
19993,44,vermont,19993,"During this incident, 84 people died, including the state's lieutenant governor."
19994,44,vermont,19994,"The 1938 New England hurricane in the fall of that year blew down 15,000,000 acres (61,000 km2) of trees, one-third of the total forest at the time in New England."
19995,44,vermont,19995,Three billion board feet were salvaged.
19996,44,vermont,19996,"Today many of the older trees in Vermont are about 75 years old, dating from after this storm."

20002,44,vermont,20002,Vermont approved women's suffrage decades before it became part of the national constitution.

20004,44,vermont,20004,"They were first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative races."
20005,44,vermont,20005,"In 1964, the US Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. Sims required ""one man, one vote"" redistricting in all states."
20006,44,vermont,20006,"It had found that many state legislatures had not redistricted and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated and industrial urban areas."
20007,44,vermont,20007,"In addition, it found that many states had an upper house based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties."
20008,44,vermont,20008,This gave disproportionate power to rural and lightly populated counties.
20009,44,vermont,20009,The court ruled there was no basis for such a structure.
20010,44,vermont,20010,Major changes in political apportionment took place in Vermont and other affected states.
20011,44,vermont,20011,"This ruling required districts to be reassessed after every census and to be based on roughly equal population, rather than geography (such as counties)."
20012,44,vermont,20012,"Under redistricting, residents in urban areas were to gain an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state."
20013,44,vermont,20013,"Vermont and some other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states in those years, who had not redistricted since the turn of the century."
20014,44,vermont,20014,"Until that time, apportionment of upper houses was often based on county jurisdictions, which had given more power to rural counties and failed to acknowledge the increased population in urban areas."
20015,44,vermont,20015,This arrangement had meant that urban areas did not have proportionate political power and often suffered from underinvestment in needed infrastructure
20016,44,vermont,20016,"In July 2000, Vermont became the first state to introduce civil unions."
20017,44,vermont,20017,"In 2009, Vermont became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage, unforced by court challenge or ruling."

20023,44,vermont,20023,"According to the United States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2019, Vermont had an estimated population of 623,989."

20025,44,vermont,20025,"In 2006 it had the second lowest birthrate in the nation, 42/1000 women."

20027,44,vermont,20027,"As of 2014, 51.3% of Vermont's population was born in the state (compared with 58.7% for the United States)."
20028,44,vermont,20028,"The changing demographics between those with multi-generational ties to the state and those who are newcomers, bringing different values with them, has resulted in a degree of tension between the two perspectives."
20029,44,vermont,20029,"This tension is expressed in the terms, ""Woodchuck"", being applied to those established in the state, and ""Flatlander"", applied to the newcomers.Vermont is the least populous New England state."
20030,44,vermont,20030,"As of 2012, Vermont was one of only two states in the US with fewer people than the District of Columbia (Wyoming was the other)."
20031,44,vermont,20031,"From 2010 to 2013, 16 out of Vermont's 251 towns experienced an increase in population."
20032,44,vermont,20032,All towns in Chittenden increased with the exception of Burlington.
20033,44,vermont,20033,"More than 180 towns experienced a decrease, which hadn't happened since the mid-19th century."
20034,44,vermont,20034,"Note: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number."
20035,44,vermont,20035,94.3% of the population identified as white not of Hispanic or Latino origin in a 2013 US Census estimate.

20041,44,vermont,20041,Its LGBT population density is second in the US only to the District of Columbia.
20042,44,vermont,20042,"Following national trends for opioid use which has roughly tripled, people seeking treatment for opioid addiction in Vermont have increased from 650 in 2011 to 7,500 in 2016."
20043,44,vermont,20043,"Owing in part to it having a low population for a US state, it has the smallest number of Hispanics out of any state in the country."
20044,44,vermont,20044,The lowest percentage of Hispanics was found in West Virginia.
20045,44,vermont,20045,"Linguists have identified speech patterns found among Vermonters as belonging to Western New England English, a dialect of New England English, which features full pronunciation of all r sounds, pronouncing horse and hoarse the same, and pronouncing vowels in father and bother the same, none of which are features traditionally shared in neighboring Eastern New England English."
20046,44,vermont,20046,"Some rural speakers realize the t as a glottal stop (mitten sounds like ""mi'in"" and Vermont like ""Vermon' "")."
20047,44,vermont,20047,"A dwindling segment of the Vermont population, generally both rural and male, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g."
20048,44,vermont,20048,"cows with a raised vowel as [kʰɛʊz] and ride with a backed, somewhat rounded vowel as [ɹɒɪd])."
20049,44,vermont,20049,"Eastern New England English—also found in New Hampshire, Maine and eastern Massachusetts—was common in eastern Vermont in the mid-twentieth century and before, but has become rare."
20050,44,vermont,20050,"This accent drops the r sound in words ending in r (farmer sounds like ""farm-uh"") and adds an r sound to some words ending in a vowel (idea sounds like ""idee-er"") was common."
20051,44,vermont,20051,Those characteristics in eastern Vermont appear to have been inherited from West Country and Scots-Irish ancestors.
20052,44,vermont,20052,"In the 21st century, Protestants (30%) and Catholics (22%) make up the majority of those reporting a religious preference, with 37% reporting no religion, the highest rate of irreligion of all states."

20083,44,vermont,20083,"In the second half of the 20th century, developers had plans to build condos and houses on what was relatively inexpensive, open land."
20084,44,vermont,20084,Vermont's government responded with a series of laws controlling development and with some pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont's dairy industry.
20085,44,vermont,20085,"Still, the number of Vermont dairy farms has declined more than 85% from the 11,206 dairy farms operating in 1947."

20094,44,vermont,20094,The average dairy farm produced 1.3 million pounds of milk annually in 2008.
20095,44,vermont,20095,"The dairy barn remains an iconic image of Vermont, but the 87% decrease in active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003 means that preservation of the dairy barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining a legacy rather than basic need in the agricultural economy."

20382,44,vermont,20382,"The brand of Republicanism in Vermont has historically been a moderate one, and combined with the newcomers from out of state, this made Vermont friendlier to Democrats as the national GOP moved to the right."
20383,44,vermont,20383,"As evidence of this, in 1990 Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, was elected to Vermont's lone seat in the House as an independent."

21067,46,washington,21067,"Despite the limited amount of rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important business throughout much of Eastern Washington, as the soil is highly productive and irrigation, aided by dams along the Columbia River, is fairly widespread."
21068,46,washington,21068,"The spread of population in Eastern Washington is dominated by access to water, especially rivers."
21069,46,washington,21069,"The main cities are all located alongside rivers or lakes; indeed, most of them are named after the river or lake they adjoin."
21070,46,washington,21070,"Farther east, the climate becomes less arid, with annual rainfall increasing as one goes east to 21.2 inches (540 mm) in Pullman, near the Washington-Idaho border."
21071,46,washington,21071,The Okanogan Highlands and the rugged Kettle River Range and Selkirk Mountains cover much of the state's northeastern quadrant.
21072,46,washington,21072,"The Palouse southeast region of Washington was grassland that has been mostly converted into farmland, and extends to the Blue Mountains."
21073,46,washington,21073,"As described above, Washington's climate varies greatly from west to east."
21074,46,washington,21074,"A Mediterranean climate predominates in western Washington, and a much drier semi-arid climate prevails east of the Cascade Range."
21075,46,washington,21075,"Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent high pressure and low pressure systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In the spring and summer, a high pressure anticyclone system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means prevailing winds from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably dry season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In the autumn and winter, a low-pressure cyclone system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,"The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably wet season."
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is used colloquially to describe atmospheric river events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest."
21081,46,washington,21081,"Despite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the ""Big Snow"" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the ""deep freeze"" winters of 1883–1884, 1915–1916, 1949–1950, and 1955–1956, among others."
21082,46,washington,21082,"During these events, western Washington experienced up to 6 feet (1.8 m) of snow, sub-zero (−18 °C) temperatures, three months with snow on the ground, and lakes and rivers frozen over for weeks."
21083,46,washington,21083,"Seattle's lowest officially recorded temperature is 0 °F (−18 °C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-altitude areas approximately three hours away from Seattle have recorded lows as cold as −48 °F (−44 °C)."
21084,46,washington,21084,The Southern Oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085,"During the El Niño phase, the jet stream enters the US farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average."
21087,46,washington,21087,"In 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington published The Impacts of Climate change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state."
21088,46,washington,21088,Rainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west.
21089,46,washington,21089,"The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as 160 inches (4,100 mm) of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a temperate rainforest."
21090,46,washington,21090,Weeks may pass without a clear day.
21091,46,washington,21091,"The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters water equivalent) in the country."
21092,46,washington,21092,"In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093,Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains (about 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing orographic lift of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels."
21095,46,washington,21095,This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures."
21097,46,washington,21097,"While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations."
21098,46,washington,21098,"Mount Baker, near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world."
21099,46,washington,21099,"In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season—1,140 inches (95 ft; 29 m)."
21100,46,washington,21100,"East of the Cascades, a large region experiences strong rain shadow effects."
21101,46,washington,21101,Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central Columbia Plateau—especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the Okanagan Highland.
21102,46,washington,21102,"Thus, instead of rain forests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry grassland, shrub-steppe, and sand dunes."
21103,46,washington,21103,The average annual temperature ranges from 51 °F (11 °C) on the Pacific coast to 40 °F (4 °C) in the northeast.
21104,46,washington,21104,The lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48 °F (−44 °C) in Winthrop and Mazama.
21105,46,washington,21105,The highest recorded temperature in the state was 118 °F (48 °C) at Ice Harbor Dam.
21106,46,washington,21106,Both records were set east of the Cascades.
21107,46,washington,21107,"Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, long-lasting drizzles in the winter and warm, temperate summers."
21108,46,washington,21108,"The Eastern region, which does not benefit from the general moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean, occasionally experiences extreme climate."
21109,46,washington,21109,Arctic cold fronts in the winter and heat waves in the summer are not uncommon.
21110,46,washington,21110,"In the Western region, temperatures have only reached as high as 107 °F (42 °C) in Centralia, and as low as −6 °F (−21 °C) in Longview."
21111,46,washington,21111,"Forests cover about half the state's land area, mostly west of the North Cascades."
21112,46,washington,21112,"Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forested area is publicly owned, including 64 percent of federal land."
21113,46,washington,21113,"Common trees and plants in the region are camassia, Douglas fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many species of ferns."
21114,46,washington,21114,"The state's various areas of wilderness offer sanctuary, with substantially large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals."
21115,46,washington,21115,"The Pacific shore surrounding the San Juan Islands are heavily inhabited with killer, gray, and humpback whales."
21116,46,washington,21116,"In Eastern Washington, the flora is vastly different."
21117,46,washington,21117,Tumbleweeds and sagebrush dominate the landscape throughout large parts of the countryside.
21118,46,washington,21118,"Russian olives and other trees are common alongside riverbanks; however, apart from the riversides, enormous swaths of Eastern Washington have no naturally existing trees at all (though many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course)."
21119,46,washington,21119,A wider variety of flora can be found in both the Blue Mountains and the eastern sides of the Cascades.
21120,46,washington,21120,"Mammals native to the state include the bat, black bear, bobcat, cougar, coyote, deer, elk, gray wolf, hare, moose, mountain beaver, muskrat, opossum, pocket gopher, rabbit, raccoon, river otter, skunk, and tree squirrel."
21121,46,washington,21121,"Because of the wide range of geography, the State of Washington is home to several different ecoregions, which allow for a varied range of bird species."
21122,46,washington,21122,"This range includes raptors, shorebirds, woodland birds, grassland birds, ducks, and others."
21123,46,washington,21123,"There have also been a large number of species introduced to Washington, dating back to the early 18th century, including horses and burros."
21124,46,washington,21124,"The channel catfish, lamprey, and sturgeon are among the 400 known freshwater fishes."
21125,46,washington,21125,"Along with the Cascades frog, there are several forms of snakes that define the most prominent reptiles and amphibians."
21126,46,washington,21126,Coastal bays and islands are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of shellfish and whales.
21127,46,washington,21127,"There are five species of salmon that ascend the Western Washington area, from streams to spawn."
21128,46,washington,21128,Washington has a variety of National Park Service units.
21129,46,washington,21129,"Among these are the Alta Lake State Park, Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, San Juan Islands National Wildlife Refuge, as well as three national parks—the Olympic National Park, North Cascades National Park, and Mount Rainier National Park."
21130,46,washington,21130,The three national parks were established between 1899 and 1968.
21131,46,washington,21131,"Almost 95 percent (876,517 acres, 354,714 hectares, 3,547.14 square kilometers) of Olympic National Park's area has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System."
21132,46,washington,21132,"Additionally, there are 143 state parks and 9 national forests, run by the Washington State Park System and the United States Forest Service."
21133,46,washington,21133,"The Okanogan National Forest is the largest national forest on the West Coast, encompassing 1,499,023 acres (606,633 ha)."
21134,46,washington,21134,"It is managed together as the Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest, encompassing a considerably larger area of around 3,239,404 acres (1,310,940 ha)."
21135,46,washington,21135,"The skeletal remains of Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most complete human remains found in North America, were discovered in Washington."
21136,46,washington,21136,"The area has been known to host megathrust earthquakes in the past, the last being the Cascadia earthquake of 1700."
21137,46,washington,21137,"Before the Europeans arrived, the region had many established tribes of aboriginal Americans, notable for their totem poles and their ornately carved canoes and masks."
21138,46,washington,21138,"Prominent among their industries were salmon fishing and, notably among the Makah, whale hunting."
21139,46,washington,21139,"The peoples of the Interior had a very different subsistence-based culture based on hunting, food-gathering and some forms of agriculture, as well as a dependency on salmon from the Columbia and its tributaries."
21140,46,washington,21140,The smallpox epidemic of the 1770s devastated the Native American population.
21141,46,washington,21141,"The first recorded European landing on the Washington coast was by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775, on board the Santiago, part of a two-ship flotilla with the Sonora."
21142,46,washington,21142,"He claimed the coastal lands up to Prince William Sound for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the Treaty of Tordesillas, which they maintained made the Pacific a ""Spanish lake"" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire."
21143,46,washington,21143,"In 1778, British explorer Captain James Cook sighted Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but Cook did not realize the strait existed."
21144,46,washington,21144,"It was not discovered until Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, sighted it in 1787."
21145,46,washington,21145,"The straits were further explored by Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer George Vancouver in 1792."
21146,46,washington,21146,"The British-Spanish Nootka Convention of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States."
21147,46,washington,21147,American captain Robert Gray (for whom Grays Harbor County is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River.
21148,46,washington,21148,"He named the river after his ship, the Columbia."
21149,46,washington,21149,"Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in sea otter pelts."

21151,46,washington,21151,"Explorer David Thompson, on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site."
21152,46,washington,21152,"Britain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as ""joint occupancy"" of lands west of the Continental Divide to the Pacific Ocean as part of the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains."
21153,46,washington,21153,"Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time."
21154,46,washington,21154,"Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession."
21155,46,washington,21155,Negotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the Oregon boundary dispute was highly contested between Britain and the United States.
21156,46,washington,21156,Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the US lasted for several decades.
21157,46,washington,21157,"With American settlers pouring into Oregon Country, Hudson's Bay Company, which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the Columbia District."
21158,46,washington,21158,"Fur trapper James Sinclair, on orders from Sir George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the Red River Colony west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near Fort Vancouver."
21159,46,washington,21159,"The party crossed the Rockies into the Columbia Valley, near present-day Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the Kootenai River and Columbia River."
21160,46,washington,21160,"Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the Oregon Treaty on June 15, 1846."
21161,46,washington,21161,"In 1836, a group of missionaries, including Marcus Whitman, established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day Walla Walla County, in territory of both the Cayuse and the Nez Perce Indian tribes."
21162,46,washington,21162,"Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the Oregon Trail, the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades."
21163,46,washington,21163,"Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients—lacking immunity to new, ""European"" diseases—died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held ""medicine man"" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the Whitman massacre in 1847."
21164,46,washington,21164,This event triggered the Cayuse War between settlers and Indians.
21165,46,washington,21165,"Fort Nisqually, a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the Puget Sound area, was founded in 1833."

21169,46,washington,21169,The growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.
21170,46,washington,21170,"As a result of the Monticello Convention, held in present-day Cowlitz County, Congress passed legislation and President Millard Fillmore signed into law on March 2, 1853, the creation of a new Washington Territory."
21171,46,washington,21171,"The boundary of Washington Territory initially extended farther east than the present state's, including what is now the Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when Oregon was admitted as a state."
21172,46,washington,21172,The creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 established the final eastern border.
21173,46,washington,21173,"A Washington State constitution was drafted and ratified in 1878, but it was never officially adopted."
21174,46,washington,21174,"Although never approved by Congress, the 1878 constitution is an important historical document which shows the political thinking of the time."
21175,46,washington,21175,"It was used extensively during the drafting of Washington State's 1889 constitution, the one and only official Constitution of the State of Washington."

21179,46,washington,21179,"Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the Douglas fir."
21180,46,washington,21180,"Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining."
21181,46,washington,21181,"For a long period, Tacoma had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated."
21182,46,washington,21182,"Seattle was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry."
21183,46,washington,21183,"The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including World War I and World War II, and the Boeing company became an established icon in the area."
21184,46,washington,21184,"During the Great Depression, a series of hydroelectric dams were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity."
21185,46,washington,21185,"This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest concrete structure in the United States."

21191,46,washington,21191,"The eruption flattened the forest up to 20 km north of the volcano, killed 57 people, flooded the Columbia River and its tributaries with ash and mud, and blanketed large parts of Washington eastward and other surrounding states in ash, making day look like night."
21192,46,washington,21192,"The United States Census Bureau estimates Washington's population was 7,614,893 on July 1, 2019, a 13.24 percent increase since the 2010 Census."
21193,46,washington,21193,"In 2018, the state ranked 13th overall in population, and was the third most populous, after California and Texas, west of the Mississippi River."

21467,47,west_virginia,21467,"The local Indians made corn bread and a flat rye bread called ""bannock"" as they emerged from the protohistoric era."
21468,47,west_virginia,21468,A horizon extending from a little before the early 18th century is sometimes called the acculturating Fireside Cabin culture.
21469,47,west_virginia,21469,Trading posts were established by European traders along the Potomac and James rivers.
21470,47,west_virginia,21470,"Tribes that inhabited West Virginia as of 1600 were the Siouan Monongahela Culture to the north, the Fort Ancient culture along the Ohio River from the Monongahela to Kentucky and extending an unknown distance inland, and the Eastern Siouan Tutelo and Moneton tribes in the southeast."
21471,47,west_virginia,21471,"There was also the Iroquoian Susquehannock in the region approximately east of the Monongahela River and north of the Monongahela National Forest, a possible tribe called the Senatorndoa, or Shenandoah, in the Shenandoah Valley and the easternmost tip of the state may have been home to the Manahoac people."
21472,47,west_virginia,21472,"The Monongahela may have been the same as a people known as the Calicua, or Cali."
21473,47,west_virginia,21473,"The following may have also all been the same tribe—Moneton, Moheton, Senatorndoa, Tomahitan."

21475,47,west_virginia,21475,"There was the Iroquoian Tiontatecaga (also Little Mingo, Guyandotte), who seem to have split off from the Petun after they were defeated by the Iroquois."
21476,47,west_virginia,21476,They eventually settled somewhere between the Kanawha and Little Kanawha Rivers.
21477,47,west_virginia,21477,"During the 1750s, when the Mingo Senatorca seceded from the Iroquois and returned to the Ohio River Valley, they contend that this tribe merged with them."
21478,47,west_virginia,21478,"The Shawnee arrived as well, but were primarily stationed within former Monongahela territory approximately until 1750, however they did extend their influence throughout the Ohio River region."
21479,47,west_virginia,21479,They were the last Native tribe of West Virginia and were driven out by the United States during the Shawnee Wars (1811–1813).
21480,47,west_virginia,21480,"The Erie, who were chased out of Ohio around 1655, are now believed to be the same as the Westo, who invaded as far as South Carolina before being destroyed in the 1680s."
21481,47,west_virginia,21481,"If so, their path would have brought them through West Virginia."
21482,47,west_virginia,21482,"The historical movement of the Tutelo, as well as Carbon dating for the Fort Ancients seem to correspond with the given period of 1655–1670 as the time of their removal."
21483,47,west_virginia,21483,"The Susquehannocks were original participants of the Beaver Wars, but were cut off from the Ohio River by the Iroquois around 1630 and found themselves in dire straits."

21485,47,west_virginia,21485,"The Manahoac were probably forced out in the 1680s, when the Iroquois began to invade Virginia."
21486,47,west_virginia,21486,"The Siouan tribes there moved into North Carolina and later returned as one tribe, known as the Eastern Blackfoot, or Christannas."
21487,47,west_virginia,21487,The Westo did not secure the territory they conquered.
21488,47,west_virginia,21488,"Before they were even gone, displaced natives from the south flooded into freshly conquered regions and took them over."
21489,47,west_virginia,21489,"These became known as the Shattaras, or West Virginia Cherokees."
21490,47,west_virginia,21490,"They took in and merged with the Monetons, who began to refer to themselves as the Mohetons."
21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicua also began to refer to themselves as Cherokees soon after, showing an apparent further merger."
21492,47,west_virginia,21492,These Shattaras were closely related to the tribes which formed to the south in the aftermath of the Westo—the Yuchi and Cherokee.
21493,47,west_virginia,21493,"From 1715 to 1717, the Yamasee War sprang up."
21494,47,west_virginia,21494,The Senatorndoa allegedly sided with the Yuchi and were destroyed by Yamasee allies.
21495,47,west_virginia,21495,"Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, this would mean the collapse of Shattara-Moneton culture."
21496,47,west_virginia,21496,"Another tribe who appeared in the region were the Canaragay, or Kanawha."
21497,47,west_virginia,21497,They later migrated to Maryland and merged into colonial culture.
21498,47,west_virginia,21498,"In 1671, General Abraham Wood, at the direction of Royal Governor William Berkeley of the Virginia Colony, sent a party from Fort Henry led by Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam to survey this territory."
21499,47,west_virginia,21499,They were the first Europeans recorded as discovering Kanawha Falls.
21500,47,west_virginia,21500,"Some sources state that Governor Alexander Spotswood's 1716 Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition (for which the state's Golden Horseshoe Competition for 8th graders was named) had penetrated as far as Pendleton County; however, modern historians interpret the original accounts of the excursion as suggesting that none of the expedition's horsemen ventured much farther west of the Blue Ridge Mountains than Harrisonburg, Virginia."
21501,47,west_virginia,21501,"John Van Metre, an Indian trader, penetrated into the northern portion in 1725."
21502,47,west_virginia,21502,"The same year, German settlers from Pennsylvania founded New Mecklenburg, the present Shepherdstown, on the Potomac River, and others followed."
21503,47,west_virginia,21503,"King Charles II of England, in 1661, granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, known as the Northern Neck."
21504,47,west_virginia,21504,"Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron ultimately took possession of this grant, and in 1746, a stone was erected at the source of the North Branch Potomac River to mark the western limit of his grant."
21505,47,west_virginia,21505,A considerable part of this land was surveyed by the young George Washington between 1748 and 1751.
21506,47,west_virginia,21506,"The diary kept by Washington recorded that there were already many squatters, largely of German origin, along the South Branch Potomac River."
21507,47,west_virginia,21507,"Christopher Gist, a surveyor in the employ of the first Ohio Company, which was composed chiefly of Virginians, explored the country along the Ohio River north of the mouth of the Kanawha River between 1751 and 1752."
21508,47,west_virginia,21508,"The company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name ""Vandalia""."
21509,47,west_virginia,21509,"Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, though they were hindered by Native American resistance."
21510,47,west_virginia,21510,"Few Native Americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state, but the region was a common hunting ground, crossed by many trails."
21511,47,west_virginia,21511,"During the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe), Indian allies of the French nearly destroyed the scattered British settlements."
21512,47,west_virginia,21512,"Shortly before the American Revolutionary War, in 1774 the Crown Governor of Virginia John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, led a force over the mountains."
21513,47,west_virginia,21513,"A body of militia under then-Colonel Andrew Lewis dealt the Shawnee Indians, under Hokoleskwa (or ""Cornstalk""), a crushing blow during the Battle of Point Pleasant at the junction of the Kanawha and the Ohio rivers."
21514,47,west_virginia,21514,"At the Treaty of Camp Charlotte concluding Dunmore's War, Cornstalk agreed to recognize the Ohio River as the new boundary with the ""Long Knives""."
21515,47,west_virginia,21515,"By 1776, however, the Shawnee had returned to war, joining the Chickamauga, a band of Cherokee known for the area where they lived."
21516,47,west_virginia,21516,Native American attacks on settlers continued until after the American Revolutionary War.
21517,47,west_virginia,21517,"During the war, the settlers in western Virginia were generally active Whigs and many served in the Continental Army."
21518,47,west_virginia,21518,"However, Claypool's Rebellion of 1780–1781, in which a group of men refused to pay taxes imposed by the Continental Army, showed war-weariness in what became West Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,Social conditions in western Virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state.
21520,47,west_virginia,21520,"The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of Pennsylvania and included Germans, Protestant Scotch-Irish, and settlers from the states farther north."
21521,47,west_virginia,21521,Counties in the east and south were settled mostly by eastern Virginians.
21522,47,west_virginia,21522,"During the American Revolution, the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was presented to Congress, on the grounds that the mountains presented an almost impassable barrier to the east."
21523,47,west_virginia,21523,"The rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable, and time only increased the social, political, economic, and cultural differences (see Tuckahoe-Cohee) between the two sections of Virginia."
21524,47,west_virginia,21524,"In 1829, a constitutional convention met in Richmond to consider reforms to Virginia's outdated constitution."
21525,47,west_virginia,21525,Philip Doddridge of Brooke County championed the cause of western Virginians who sought a more democratic frame of government.
21526,47,west_virginia,21526,"However, western reforms were rejected by leaders from east of the Alleghenies who ""clung to political power in an effort to preserve their plantation lifestyles dependent on enslaving blacks""."
21527,47,west_virginia,21527,Virginia leaders maintained a property qualification for suffrage effectively disenfranchising poorer farmers in the west whose families did much of the farm-work themselves.
21528,47,west_virginia,21528,"In addition, the 1829–1830 convention gave the slave-holding counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population in apportioning the state's representation in the US House of Representatives."
21529,47,west_virginia,21529,"As a result, every county west of the Alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution, which nevertheless passed because of eastern support."
21530,47,west_virginia,21530,Failure of the eastern planter elite to make constitutional reforms exacerbated existing east–west sectionalism in Virginia and contributed to Virginia's later division.
21531,47,west_virginia,21531,"The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850–51, the Reform Convention, addressed a number of issues important to western Virginians."
21532,47,west_virginia,21532,It extended the vote to all white males 21 years or older.
21533,47,west_virginia,21533,"The governor, lieutenant governor, the judiciary, sheriffs, and other county officers were to be elected by public vote."
21534,47,west_virginia,21534,The composition of the General Assembly was changed.
21535,47,west_virginia,21535,"Representation in the house of delegates was apportioned on the basis of the census of 1850, counting whites only."
21536,47,west_virginia,21536,"The Senatorte representation was arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats, with the west receiving twenty, and the east thirty senators."
21537,47,west_virginia,21537,"This was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the General Assembly to reapportion representation on the basis of white population in 1865, or else put the matter to a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value, except for slaves."
21539,47,west_virginia,21539,"Slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only $300, a fraction of their true value."
21540,47,west_virginia,21540,"Small farmers, however, had all their assets, animals, and land taxed at full value."
21541,47,west_virginia,21541,"Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the west, the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542,"Most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the west."
21543,47,west_virginia,21543,"Given these differences, many in the west had long contemplated a separate state."
21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men such as lawyer Francis H. Pierpont from Fairmont, had long chafed under the political domination of the Tidewater and Piedmont slave-holders."
21545,47,west_virginia,21545,"In addition to differences over the abolition of slavery, he and allies felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west, such as turnpikes and railroads."
21546,47,west_virginia,21546,West Virginia was the only state in the Union to separate from a Confederate state (Virginia) during the American Civil War.
21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 voted to secede from the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner (which ultimately became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favor of the Ordinance of Secession, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548,"Almost immediately after that vote, a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"When this First Wheeling Convention met, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, though more than one-third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550,"Soon, there was a division of sentiment."
21551,47,west_virginia,21551,"Some delegates led by John S. Carlile favored the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum (as happened on May 23), such action would constitute revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if Virginians adopted the secession ordinance (of which there was little doubt), another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On May 23, 1861, secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the Ordinance."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on June 11 and declared that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its acts were void and that all who adhered to it had vacated their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of its 103 members, 33 had been elected to the Virginia General Assembly on May 23."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557,"This included some hold-over state senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and some who vacated their offices to convene in Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558,"Other members ""were chosen even more irregularly—some in mass meetings, others by county committee, and still others were seemingly self-appointed""."
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,An act for the reorganization of the government was passed on June 19.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The next day convention delegates chose Francis H. Pierpont as governor of Virginia, and elected other officers to a rival state government and two US senators (Willey and Carlile) to replace secessionists before adjourning."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,"The federal government in Washington, D.C. promptly recognized the new government and seated the two new senators."
21562,47,west_virginia,21562,"Thus, there were two state governments in Virginia: one pledging allegiance to the United States and one to the Confederacy."
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The second Wheeling Convention had recessed until August 6, then reassembled on August 20 and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"At the October 24, 1861 election, 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The election results were questioned, since the Union army then occupied the area and Union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"This was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in camps of Confederate soldiers, who elected rival state officials, such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567,Most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the Northern panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"Over 50,000 votes had been cast on the Ordinance of Secession, yet the vote on statehood garnered little more than 19,000."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, home to Wheeling, only about a fourth of the registered voters cast votes."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote at all, as two-thirds of the territory of West Virginia had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,Votes recorded from pro-secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by Unionist refugees from these counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572,"Despite that controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to write a new Constitution for the new state, beginning on November 26, 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573,"During that constitutional convention, a Mr. Lamb of Ohio County and a Mr. Carskadon claimed that in Hampshire County, out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state; the rest were cast illegally by Union soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One of the key figures was Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools, as well as to limit movement of slaves into the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The education proposal succeeded, but the convention tabled the slavery proposals before finishing its work on February 18, 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution was more closely modeled on that of Ohio than of Virginia, adopting a township model of government rather than the ""courthouse cliques"" of Virginia which Carlile criticized, and a compromise demanded by the Kanawha region (Charleston lawyers Benjamin Smith and Brown) allowed counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railroads or other improvement organizations."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578,"The resulting instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on April 11, 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,"On May 13, 1862 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state."
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,"An application for admission to the Union was made to Congress, introduced by Senatortor Waitman Willey of the Restored Government of Virginia."
21581,47,west_virginia,21581,"However, Senator Carlile sought to sabotage the bill, first trying to expand the new state's boundaries to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then to defeat the Willey amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling act was approved by President Abraham Lincoln admitting West Virginia, on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle had urged in the Wheeling Intelligencer and also written to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584,"While many felt West Virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln issued his Opinion on the Admission of West Virginia finding that ""the body which consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Legislature of Virginia"", and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,"The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met."
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,"The revised constitution was adopted on March 26, 1863 and on April 20, 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state 60 days later on June 20, 1863."
21587,47,west_virginia,21587,"Meanwhile, officers for the new state were chosen, while Gov."
21588,47,west_virginia,21588,"Pierpont moved his pro-Union Virginia capital to Union-occupied Alexandria, where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all the remaining Virginia counties within the federal lines."
21589,47,west_virginia,21589,The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was later brought before the Supreme Court of the United States in Virginia v. West Virginia.
21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties lying on the Potomac east of the mountains, in 1863, with the consent of the reorganized government of Virginia voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591,Many voters of the strongly pro-secessionist counties were absent in the Confederate Army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer when they returned.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly repealed the act of secession and, in 1866, brought suit against West Virginia asking the court to declare the counties a part of Virginia, which would have declared West Virginia's admission as a state unconstitutional."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593,"Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court decided in favor of West Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595,"During the Civil War, Union General George B. McClellan's forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating at the Battle of Rich Mountain, and Union control was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863, General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 Confederates, raided a considerable portion of the state and burned Pierpont's library, although Senatortor Willey escaped their grasp."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,"Bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections, and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended."
21598,47,west_virginia,21598,"The Eastern Panhandle counties were more affected by the war, with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands."
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The area that became West Virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, approximately 22,000–25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to strip voting rights from returning Confederates in order to retain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said if it was not enacted he would lose election by 500 votes."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of Confederates might also be confiscated, and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the Confederacy was adopted."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution caused a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,"The Democratic party secured control in 1870, and in 1871, the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated."
21605,47,west_virginia,21605,"The first steps toward this change had been taken, however, by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,"On August 22, 1872, an entirely new constitution was adopted."
21607,47,west_virginia,21607,"Beginning in Reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states disputed the new state's share of the pre-war Virginia government's debts, which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements, such as canals, roads, and railroads under the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,Virginians—led by former Confederate general William Mahone—formed a political coalition based upon this: the Readjuster Party.
21609,47,west_virginia,21609,"Although West Virginia's first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the Virginia debt, negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were fruitless, and in 1871, Virginia funded two-thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally settled in 1915, when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The final instalment of this sum was paid in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612,"After Reconstruction, the new 35th state benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other single economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613,"Saltpeter caves had been employed throughout Appalachia for munitions; the border between West Virginia and Virginia includes the ""Saltpeter Trail"", a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate which were rendered and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail stretched from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the route in the town of Union, Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615,"Nearly half of these caves are on the West Virginia side, including Organ Cave and Haynes Cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"In the late 18th-century, saltpeter miners in Haynes Cave found large animal bones in the deposits."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617,These were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier Colonel John Stuart to Thomas Jefferson.
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were named Megalonyx jeffersonii, or great-claw, and became known as Jefferson's three-toed sloth."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,It was declared the official state fossil of West Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The West Virginia official state rock is bituminous coal, and the official state gemstone is silicified Mississippian fossil Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621,"The limestone also produced a useful quarry industry, usually small, and softer, high-calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622,"This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years a specific portion of the C & O Railroad carried limestone rock to Clifton Forge, Virginia as an industrial flux."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"Salt mining had been underway since the 18th century, though it had largely played out by the time of the American Civil War, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valued commodity of first Confederate, and later Union, forces."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In years following, more sophisticated mining methods would restore West Virginia's role as a major producer of salt."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625,"However, in the second half of the 19th century, there was an even greater treasure not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626,It would fuel much of the Industrial Revolution in the US and the steamships of many of the world's navies.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627,"The residents (both Native Americans and early European settlers) had long known of the underlying coal, and that it could be used for heating and fuel."
21628,47,west_virginia,21628,"However, for a long time, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629,"After the War, with the new railroads came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding US and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630,"As the anthracite mines of northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period, investors and industrialists focused new interest in West Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,The completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) across the state to the new city of Huntington on the Ohio River in 1872 opened access to the New River Coal Field.
21633,47,west_virginia,21633,"Soon, the C&O was building its huge coal pier at Newport News, Virginia on the large harbor of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new Philadelphia-based owners of the former Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&O), which stretched across Virginia's southern tier from Norfolk, had sights clearly set on the Mountain State, where the owners had large land holdings."
21635,47,west_virginia,21635,"Their railroad was renamed Norfolk and Western (N&W), and a new railroad city was developed at Roanoke to handle planned expansion."
21636,47,west_virginia,21636,"After its new president Frederick J. Kimball and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam, which Kimball's wife named Pocahontas, the N&W redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it."
21637,47,west_virginia,21637,"Soon, the N&W was also shipping from new coal piers at Hampton Roads."
21638,47,west_virginia,21638,"In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and Western rail lines, the important coal center of Bluefield, West Virginia was founded."
21639,47,west_virginia,21639,"The ""capital"" of the Pocahontas coalfield, this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades."
21640,47,west_virginia,21640,"It shares a sister city with the same name, Bluefield, in Virginia."
21641,47,west_virginia,21641,"In the northern portion of the state and elsewhere, the older Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities."
21642,47,west_virginia,21642,The B&O developed coal piers in Baltimore and at several points on the Great Lakes.
21643,47,west_virginia,21643,"Other significant rail carriers of coal were the Western Maryland Railway (WM), Southern Railway (SOU), and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N)."
21644,47,west_virginia,21644,"Particularly notable was a latecomer, the Virginian Railway (VGN)."
21645,47,west_virginia,21645,By 1900 only the most rugged terrain of southern West Virginia was any distance from the existing railroads and mining activity.
21646,47,west_virginia,21646,"Within this area west of the New River Coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties lay the Winding Gulf Coalfield, later promoted as the ""Billion Dollar Coalfield""."
21647,47,west_virginia,21647,"A protégé of Dr. Ansted was William Nelson Page (1854–1932), a civil engineer and mining manager in Fayette County."
21648,47,west_virginia,21648,"Former West Virginia governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land ""as a farmer knows a field""."
21649,47,west_virginia,21649,"Beginning in 1898, Page teamed with northern and European-based investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area."
21650,47,west_virginia,21650,"They acquired large tracts of land in the area, and Page began the Deepwater Railway, a short-line railroad chartered to stretch between the C&O at its line along the Kanawha River and the N&W at Matoaka—a distance of about 80 miles (130 km)."
21651,47,west_virginia,21651,"Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad, leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme."
21652,47,west_virginia,21652,"In secret collusion, each declined to negotiate favorable rates with Page, nor did they offer to purchase his railroad, as they had many other short-lines."
21653,47,west_virginia,21653,"However, if the C&O and N&W presidents thought they could thus kill the Page project, they were to be proved mistaken."
21654,47,west_virginia,21654,"One of the silent partner investors Page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a principal in John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust and an old hand at developing natural resources and transportation."
21655,47,west_virginia,21655,"A master at competitive ""warfare"", Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his endeavors and also had ""deep pockets""."
21656,47,west_virginia,21656,"Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40 million cost."
21657,47,west_virginia,21657,"When the renamed Virginian Railway (VGN) was completed in 1909, no fewer than three railroads were shipping ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads."
21658,47,west_virginia,21658,West Virginia coal was also under high demand at Great Lakes ports.
21659,47,west_virginia,21659,"The VGN and the N&W ultimately became parts of the modern Norfolk Southern system, and the VGN's well-engineered 21st-century tracks continue to offer a favorable gradient to Hampton Roads."
21660,47,west_virginia,21660,"As coal mining and related work became major employment activities in the state, there was considerable labor strife as working conditions, safety issues and economic concerns arose."
21661,47,west_virginia,21661,"Even in the 21st century, mining safety and ecological concerns is still challenging to the state whose coal continues to power electrical generating plants in many other states."
21662,47,west_virginia,21662,"Coal is not the only valuable mineral found in West Virginia, as the state was the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34.48 carat (6.896 g) Jones Diamond."
21663,47,west_virginia,21663,"Located in the Appalachian Mountain range, West Virginia covers an area of 24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km2), with 24,077.73 square miles (62,361.0 km2) of land and 152.03 square miles (393.8 km2) of water, making it the 41st-largest state in the United States."
21664,47,west_virginia,21664,"West Virginia borders Pennsylvania and Maryland in the northeast, Virginia in the southeast, Ohio in the northwest, and Kentucky in the southwest."
21665,47,west_virginia,21665,"Its longest border is with Virginia at 381 miles (613 km), followed by Ohio at 243 miles (391 km), Maryland at 174 miles (280 km), Pennsylvania at 118 miles (190 km), and Kentucky at 79 miles (127 km)."
21666,47,west_virginia,21666,"West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname The Mountain State and the motto Montani Semper Liberi (""Mountaineers are always free"")."
21667,47,west_virginia,21667,The elevations and ruggedness drop near large rivers like the Ohio River or Shenandoah River.
21668,47,west_virginia,21668,About 75% of the state is within the Cumberland Plateau and Allegheny Plateau regions.
21669,47,west_virginia,21669,"Though the relief is not high, the plateau region is extremely rugged in most areas."
21670,47,west_virginia,21670,"The average elevation of West Virginia is approximately 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, which is the highest of any US state east of the Mississippi River."
21671,47,west_virginia,21671,"On the eastern state line with Virginia, high peaks in the Monongahela National Forest region give rise to an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those of northern New England and eastern Canada."
21672,47,west_virginia,21672,"The highest point in the state is atop Spruce Knob, at 4,863 feet (1,482 m), and is covered in a boreal forest of dense spruce trees at altitudes above 4,000 feet (1,200 m)."
21673,47,west_virginia,21673,Spruce Knob lies within the Monongahela National Forest and is a part of the Spruce Knob-Senatorca Rocks National Recreation Area.
21674,47,west_virginia,21674,A total of six wilderness areas can also be found within the forest.
21675,47,west_virginia,21675,"Outside the forest to the south, the New River Gorge is a canyon 1,000 feet (300 m) deep, carved by the New River."
21676,47,west_virginia,21676,The National Park Service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.
21677,47,west_virginia,21677,Other areas under protection and management include:
21678,47,west_virginia,21678,"Most of West Virginia lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion, while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests."
21679,47,west_virginia,21679,"The native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak, chestnut, maple, beech, and white pine, with willow and American sycamore along the state's waterways."
21680,47,west_virginia,21680,"Many of the areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact appreciated by native West Virginians, who refer to their home as Almost Heaven (from the song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" by John Denver)."
21681,47,west_virginia,21681,"Before the song, it was known as ""The Cog State"" (Coal, Oil, and Gas) or ""The Mountain State""."
21682,47,west_virginia,21682,"The underlying rock strata are sandstone, shale, bituminous coal beds, and limestone laid down in a near-shore environment from sediments derived from mountains to the east, in a shallow inland sea on the west."
21683,47,west_virginia,21683,"Some beds illustrate a coastal swamp environment, some river delta, some shallow water."

21995,48,wisconsin,21995,"After the ice age ended around 8000 BCE, people in the subsequent Archaic period lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering food from wild plants."
21996,48,wisconsin,21996,Agricultural societies emerged gradually over the Woodland period between 1000 BCE to 1000 CE.
21997,48,wisconsin,21997,"Toward the end of this period, Wisconsin was the heartland of the ""Effigy Mound culture"", which built thousands of animal-shaped mounds across the landscape."
21998,48,wisconsin,21998,"Later, between 1000 and 1500 CE, the Mississippian and Oneota cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at Aztalan in southeast Wisconsin."
21999,48,wisconsin,21999,The Oneota may be the ancestors of the modern Ioway and Ho-Chunk nations who shared the Wisconsin region with the Menominee at the time of European contact.
22000,48,wisconsin,22000,"Other Native American groups living in Wisconsin when Europeans first settled included the Ojibwa, Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, and Pottawatomie, who migrated to Wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 1700."
22001,48,wisconsin,22001,The first European to visit what became Wisconsin was probably the French explorer Jean Nicolet.
22002,48,wisconsin,22002,"He canoed west from Georgian Bay through the Great Lakes in 1634, and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near Green Bay at Red Banks."
22003,48,wisconsin,22003,"Pierre Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers visited Green Bay again in 1654–1666 and Chequamegon Bay in 1659–1660, where they traded for fur with local Native Americans."
22004,48,wisconsin,22004,"In 1673, Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet became the first to record a journey on the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway all the way to the Mississippi River near Prairie du Chien."
22005,48,wisconsin,22005,"Frenchmen like Nicholas Perrot continued to ply the fur trade across Wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries, but the French made no permanent settlements in Wisconsin before Great Britain won control of the region following the French and Indian War in 1763."
22006,48,wisconsin,22006,"Even so, French traders continued to work in the region after the war, and some, beginning with Charles de Langlade in 1764, settled in Wisconsin permanently, rather than returning to British-controlled Canada."
22007,48,wisconsin,22007,"The British gradually took over Wisconsin during the French and Indian War, taking control of Green Bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of Wisconsin in 1763."
22008,48,wisconsin,22008,"Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade."
22009,48,wisconsin,22009,"One notable event in the fur trading industry in Wisconsin occurred in 1791, when two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present day Marinette."
22010,48,wisconsin,22010,"The first permanent settlers, mostly French Canadians, some Anglo-New Englanders and a few African American freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control."
22011,48,wisconsin,22011,"Charles Michel de Langlade is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764."
22012,48,wisconsin,22012,Settlement began at Prairie du Chien around 1781.
22013,48,wisconsin,22013,"The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as ""La Baye"", however British fur traders referred to it as ""Green Bay"", because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring."
22014,48,wisconsin,22014,"The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of ""Green Bay"" eventually stuck."
22015,48,wisconsin,22015,The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British.
22016,48,wisconsin,22016,"During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and to French residents."
22017,48,wisconsin,22017,"The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established as well."
22018,48,wisconsin,22018,"From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities."
22019,48,wisconsin,22019,Wisconsin became a territorial possession of the United States in 1783 after the American Revolutionary War.
22020,48,wisconsin,22020,"In 1787, it became part of the Northwest Territory."
22021,48,wisconsin,22021,"As territorial boundaries subsequently developed, it was then part of Indiana Territory from 1800 to 1809, Illinois Territory from 1809 to 1818, and Michigan Territory from 1818 to 1836."
22022,48,wisconsin,22022,"However, the British remained in control until after the War of 1812, the outcome of which finally established an American presence in the area."
22023,48,wisconsin,22023,"Under American control, the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining."
22024,48,wisconsin,22024,"The prospect of easy mineral wealth drew immigrants from throughout the US and Europe to the lead deposits located at Mineral Point, Dodgeville, and nearby areas."
22025,48,wisconsin,22025,"Some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug, and earned the nickname ""badgers"", leading to Wisconsin's identity as the ""Badger State""."
22026,48,wisconsin,22026,The sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local Native American population.
22027,48,wisconsin,22027,The Winnebago War of 1827 and the Black Hawk War of 1832 culminated in the forced removal of Native Americans from most parts of the state.
22028,48,wisconsin,22028,"Following these conflicts, Wisconsin Territory was created by an act of the United States Congress on April 20, 1836."
22029,48,wisconsin,22029,"By fall of that year, the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding what is now Milwaukee were occupied by farmers from the New England states."
22030,48,wisconsin,22030,The Erie Canal facilitated the travel of both Yankee settlers and European immigrants to Wisconsin Territory.
22031,48,wisconsin,22031,"Yankees from New England and upstate New York seized a dominant position in law and politics, enacting policies that marginalized the region's earlier Native American and French-Canadian residents."
22032,48,wisconsin,22032,"Yankees also speculated in real estate, platted towns such as Racine, Beloit, Burlington, and Janesville, and established schools, civic institutions, and Congregationalist churches."
22033,48,wisconsin,22033,"At the same time, many Germans, Irish, Norwegians, and other immigrants also settled in towns and farms across the territory, establishing Catholic and Lutheran institutions."
22034,48,wisconsin,22034,"The growing population allowed Wisconsin to gain statehood on May 29, 1848, as the 30th state."
22035,48,wisconsin,22035,"Between 1840 and 1850, Wisconsin's non-Indian population had swollen from 31,000 to 305,000."
22036,48,wisconsin,22036,"More than a third of residents (110,500) were foreign born, including 38,000 Germans, 28,000 British immigrants from England, Scotland, and Wales, and 21,000 Irish."
22037,48,wisconsin,22037,"Another third (103,000) were Yankees from New England and western New York state."
22038,48,wisconsin,22038,"Only about 63,000 residents in 1850 had been born in Wisconsin."
22039,48,wisconsin,22039,"Nelson Dewey, the first governor of Wisconsin, was a Democrat."
22040,48,wisconsin,22040,Dewey oversaw the transition from the territorial to the new state government.
22041,48,wisconsin,22041,"He encouraged the development of the state's infrastructure, particularly the construction of new roads, railroads, canals, and harbors, as well as the improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers."
22042,48,wisconsin,22042,"During his administration, the State Board of Public Works was organized."
22043,48,wisconsin,22043,"Dewey, an abolitionist, was the first of many Wisconsin governors to advocate against the spread of slavery into new states and territories."
22044,48,wisconsin,22044,Politics in early Wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over slavery.
22045,48,wisconsin,22045,"A free state from its foundation, Wisconsin became a center of northern abolitionism."
22046,48,wisconsin,22046,"The debate became especially intense in 1854 after Joshua Glover, a runaway slave from Missouri, was captured in Racine."
22047,48,wisconsin,22047,"Glover was taken into custody under the Federal Fugitive Slave Law, but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada."
22048,48,wisconsin,22048,"In a trial stemming from the incident, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ultimately declared the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional."
22049,48,wisconsin,22049,"The Republican Party, founded on March 20, 1854, by anti-slavery expansion activists in Ripon, Wisconsin, grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events."
22050,48,wisconsin,22050,"During the Civil War, around 91,000 troops from Wisconsin fought for the Union."
22051,48,wisconsin,22051,Wisconsin's economy also diversified during the early years of statehood.
22052,48,wisconsin,22052,"While lead mining diminished, agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state."
22053,48,wisconsin,22053,"Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market, and industries like J.I."
22054,48,wisconsin,22054,Case & Company in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment.
22055,48,wisconsin,22055,Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation's leading producers of wheat during the 1860s.
22056,48,wisconsin,22056,"Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin, and sawmills sprang up in cities like La Crosse, Eau Claire, and Wausau."
22057,48,wisconsin,22057,These economic activities had dire environmental consequences.
22058,48,wisconsin,22058,"By the close of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and lumbering had deforested most of the state."
22059,48,wisconsin,22059,These conditions forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline.
22060,48,wisconsin,22060,"Beginning in the 1890s, farmers in Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production in order to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land."
22061,48,wisconsin,22061,"Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by Stephen Babcock at the University of Wisconsin, helped the state build a reputation as ""America's Dairyland""."
22062,48,wisconsin,22062,"Meanwhile, conservationists including Aldo Leopold helped re-establish the state's forests during the early 20th century, paving the way for a more renewable lumber and paper milling industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands."
22063,48,wisconsin,22063,"Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe."
22064,48,wisconsin,22064,"Industries in cities like Milwaukee ranged from brewing and food processing to heavy machine production and tool-making, leading Wisconsin to rank 8th among US states in total product value by 1910."
22065,48,wisconsin,22065,The early 20th century was also notable for the emergence of progressive politics championed by Robert M. La Follette.
22066,48,wisconsin,22066,"Between 1901 and 1914, Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin created the nation's first comprehensive statewide primary election system, the first effective workplace injury compensation law, and the first state income tax, making taxation proportional to actual earnings."
22067,48,wisconsin,22067,The progressive Wisconsin Idea also promoted the statewide expansion of the University of Wisconsin through the UW-Extension system at this time.
22068,48,wisconsin,22068,"Later, UW economics professors John R. Commons and Harold Groves helped Wisconsin create the first unemployment compensation program in the United States in 1932."
22069,48,wisconsin,22069,"In the immediate aftermath of World War II, citizens of Wisconsin were divided over things such as creation of the United Nations, support for the European recovery, and the growth of the Soviet Union's power."
22070,48,wisconsin,22070,"However, when Europe divided into Communist and capitalist camps and the Communist revolution in China succeeded in 1949, public opinion began to move towards support for the protection of democracy and capitalism against Communist expansion."
22071,48,wisconsin,22071,"Wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century, ranging from the anti-communist crusades of Senatortor Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at UW-Madison that culminated in the Sterling Hall bombing in August 1970."
22072,48,wisconsin,22072,The state undertook welfare reform under Republican Governor Tommy Thompson during the 1990s.
22073,48,wisconsin,22073,"The state's economy also underwent further transformations towards the close of the 20th century, as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favor of a service economy based on medicine, education, agribusiness, and tourism."
22074,48,wisconsin,22074,"Two US Navy battleships, BB-9 and BB-64, were named for the state."
22075,48,wisconsin,22075,"In 2011, Wisconsin became the focus of some controversy when newly elected governor Scott Walker proposed, successfully passed, and enacted the 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, which made large changes in the areas of collective bargaining, compensation, retirement, health insurance, and sick leave of public sector employees, among other changes."
22076,48,wisconsin,22076,"A series of major protests by union supporters took place that year in response to the changes, and Walker survived a recall election held the next year, becoming the first governor in United States history to do so."
22077,48,wisconsin,22077,"Walker enacted other bills promoting conservative governance, such as a right-to-work law, abortion restrictions, and legislation removing certain gun controls."

22381,49,wyoming,22381,Precipitation depends on elevation with lower areas in the Big Horn Basin averaging 5–8 inches (130–200 mm) (making the area nearly a true desert).
22382,49,wyoming,22382,"The lower areas in the North and on the eastern plains typically average around 10–12 inches (250–300 mm), making the climate there semi-arid."
22383,49,wyoming,22383,"Some mountain areas do receive a good amount of precipitation, 20 inches (510 mm) or more, much of it as snow, sometimes 200 inches (510 cm) or more annually."
22384,49,wyoming,22384,"The state's highest recorded temperature is 114 °F (46 °C) at Basin on July 12, 1900 and the lowest recorded temperature is −66 °F (−54 °C) at Riverside on February 9, 1933."

22391,49,wyoming,22391,"Wyoming is one of only three states (the others being Colorado and Utah) to have borders defined by only ""straight"" lines."
22392,49,wyoming,22392,"Due to surveying inaccuracies during the 19th century, Wyoming's legal border deviates from the true latitude and longitude lines by up to half of a mile (0.8 km) in some spots, especially in the mountainous region along the 45th parallel."
22393,49,wyoming,22393,"Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho."

22406,49,wyoming,22406,The Continental Divide spans north–south across the central portion of the state.
22407,49,wyoming,22407,Rivers east of the divide drain into the Missouri River Basin and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.
22408,49,wyoming,22408,"They are the North Platte, Wind, Big Horn and the Yellowstone rivers."
22409,49,wyoming,22409,"The Snake River in northwest Wyoming eventually drains into the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean, as does the Green River through the Colorado River Basin."
22410,49,wyoming,22410,The Continental Divide forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the Great Divide Basin where water that precipitates onto or flows into it cannot reach an ocean—it all sinks into the soil and eventually evaporates.
22411,49,wyoming,22411,"Several rivers begin in or flow through the state, including the Yellowstone River, Bighorn River, Green River, and the Snake River."
22412,49,wyoming,22412,"Wyoming has 32 named islands; the majority are in Jackson Lake and Yellowstone Lake, within Yellowstone National Park in the northwest portion of the state."

22422,49,wyoming,22422,The Wind River Indian Reservation is shared by the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes of Native Americans in the central western portion of the state near Lander.
22423,49,wyoming,22423,"The reservation is home to 2,500 Eastern Shoshone and 5,000 Northern Arapaho."
22424,49,wyoming,22424,Chief Washakie established the reservation in 1868 as the result of negotiations with the federal government in the Fort Bridger Treaty.
22425,49,wyoming,22425,"However, the Northern Arapaho were forced onto the Shoshone reservation in 1876 by the federal government after the government failed to provide a promised separate reservation."
22426,49,wyoming,22426,"Today the Wind River Indian Reservation is jointly owned, with each tribe having a 50% interest in the land, water, and other natural resources."
22427,49,wyoming,22427,"The reservation is a sovereign, self-governed land with two independent governing bodies: the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and the Northern Arapaho Tribe."
22428,49,wyoming,22428,"Until 2014, the Shoshone Business Council and Northern Arapaho Business Council met jointly as the Joint Business Council to decide matters that affect both tribes."
22429,49,wyoming,22429,Six elected council members from each tribe served on the joint council.
22430,49,wyoming,22430,"Nearly half the land in Wyoming (about 30,099,430 acres (121,808.1 km2)) is owned by the federal government; the state owns another 3,864,800 acres (15,640 km2)."
22431,49,wyoming,22431,"Most of it is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service in numerous national forests and a national grassland, not to mention vast swaths of ""public"" land and an air force base near Cheyenne."
22432,49,wyoming,22432,There are also areas managed by the National Park Service and agencies such as the US
22433,49,wyoming,22433,Fish and Wildlife Service.
22434,49,wyoming,22434,Several Native American groups originally inhabited the region now known as Wyoming.
22435,49,wyoming,22435,"The Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone were but a few of the original inhabitants white explorers encountered when they first visited the region."
22436,49,wyoming,22436,"What is now southwestern Wyoming became a part of the Spanish Empire, and later Mexican territory, of Alta California, until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican–American War."
22437,49,wyoming,22437,"French-Canadian trappers from Québec and Montréal ventured into the area in the late 18th century, leaving French toponyms such as Téton and La Ramie."
22438,49,wyoming,22438,"John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, itself guided by French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his young Shoshone wife, Sacagawea, first described the region in 1807."
22439,49,wyoming,22439,"At the time, his reports of the Yellowstone area were considered to be fictional."
22440,49,wyoming,22440,"Robert Stuart and a party of five men, returning from Astoria, discovered South Pass in 1812."
22441,49,wyoming,22441,The Oregon Trail later followed that route.
22442,49,wyoming,22442,"In 1850, Jim Bridger located what is now known as Bridger Pass, which the Union Pacific Railroad used in 1868, as did Interstate 80, 90 years later."
22443,49,wyoming,22443,"Bridger also explored Yellowstone and filed reports on the region that, like those of Colter, were largely regarded at the time as tall tales."
22444,49,wyoming,22444,"The region acquired the name Wyoming by 1865, when Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio introduced a bill to Congress to provide a ""temporary government for the territory of Wyoming""."
22445,49,wyoming,22445,"The territory was named after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, made famous by the 1809 poem Gertrude of Wyoming by Thomas Campbell, based on the Battle of Wyoming in the American Revolutionary War."
22446,49,wyoming,22446,"The name ultimately derives from the Munsee word xwé:wamənk, meaning ""at the big river flat""."
22447,49,wyoming,22447,"The region's population grew steadily after the Union Pacific Railroad reached the town of Cheyenne in 1867, and the federal government established the Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868."
22448,49,wyoming,22448,"Wyoming lacked significant deposits of gold and silver, unlike mineral-rich Colorado, and did not experience Colorado's related population boom."
22449,49,wyoming,22449,"However, South Pass City did have a short-lived boom after the Carissa Mine began producing gold in 1867."
22450,49,wyoming,22450,"Furthermore, copper was mined in some areas between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Snowy Range near Grand Encampment."
22451,49,wyoming,22451,"Once government-sponsored expeditions to the Yellowstone country began, reports by Colter and Bridger, previously believed to be apocryphal, were found to be true."
22452,49,wyoming,22452,"That led to the creation of Yellowstone National Park, which became the world's first national park in 1872."
22453,49,wyoming,22453,Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park lies within the far northwestern borders of Wyoming.
22454,49,wyoming,22454,"On December 10, 1869, territorial Governor John Allen Campbell extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and, later, United States state, to grant suffrage to women."
22455,49,wyoming,22455,Wyoming was also a pioneer in welcoming women into politics.
22456,49,wyoming,22456,Women first served on juries in Wyoming (Laramie in 1870).
22457,49,wyoming,22457,"Wyoming had the first female court bailiff (Mary Atkinson, Laramie, in 1870), and the first female justice of the peace in the country (Esther Hobart Morris, South Pass City, in 1870)."

22461,49,wyoming,22461,"Congress admitted Wyoming into the Union as the 44th state on July 10, 1890."
22462,49,wyoming,22462,"Wyoming was the location of the Johnson County War of 1892, which erupted between competing groups of cattle ranchers."
22463,49,wyoming,22463,The passage of the federal Homestead Act led to an influx of small ranchers.
22464,49,wyoming,22464,A range war broke out when either or both of the groups chose violent conflict over commercial competition in the use of the public land.
