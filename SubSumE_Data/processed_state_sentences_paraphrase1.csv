113,0,alabama,113,"The Alabama Legislative Assembly, dominated by rural areas, has always underfunded schools and services for African Americans deprived of their rights, but it has not exempted them from taxes."

115,0,alabama,115,"In Alabama, these schools were designed and the construction was partially financed by the Rosenwald funds, which paid one third of the construction costs."
116,0,alabama,116,The fund required the local community and the state to raise matching funds to pay the rest.
117,0,alabama,117,"Black residents have actually taxed themselves twice, raising additional funds to provide matching funds to these schools, which have been built in many rural areas."

121,0,alabama,121,Many of the remaining school buildings in the state are now on the National Register of Historic Sites.
122,0,alabama,122,"The continuation of racial discrimination and lynching, the agricultural depression and the failure of cotton crops due to the infestation of the plow has led tens of thousands of African-Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in the cities of the north and center-west during the first decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South."
123,0,alabama,123,"In view of this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see the table ""historical populations"" below) declined by almost half between 1910 and 1920."
124,0,alabama,124,"At the same time, many rural populations have migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs."
125,0,alabama,125,"Birmingham grew as fast as it was called the ""magic city""."
126,0,alabama,126,In 1920 Birmingham was the 36th city in the United States.
127,0,alabama,127,Heavy industry and the mining industry were at the root of its economy.

129,0,alabama,129,"This did not change until the late 1960s, following a trial and a court order."
130,0,alabama,130,Industrial development linked to the demands of the Second World War brought a level of prosperity to the unseen state since before the civil war.
131,0,alabama,131,Rural workers have flocked to the largest cities in the state to obtain better jobs and a higher standard of living.
132,0,alabama,132,An example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile.
133,0,alabama,133,"Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people settled in the city to work in war-related industries."
134,0,alabama,134,Cotton and other commercial crops have become less important as the state has developed a production and service base.
135,0,alabama,135,"Despite the massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the predominantly rural legislator refused to renew the seats of the House and Senators according to the population, as required by the constitution of the State to follow the results of the decennial censuses."
136,0,alabama,136,They have maintained their former representation in order to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas.
137,0,alabama,137,"As a result, Jefferson County, home to Birmingham's industrial and economic power, paid more than a third of all tax revenues to the state, but did not receive a proportionate amount in services."
138,0,alabama,138,Urban interests are constantly under-represented in the legislature.
139,0,alabama,139,"A 1960 study indicated that, due to rural domination, ""a minority of about 25 per cent of the total population of the State is under the majority control of the Alabama Legislative Assembly""."
140,0,alabama,140,"In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the principle of ""one man, one vote"" should be the basis of both chambers of state legislatures, and that their districts should be based on population rather than geographic counties."
141,0,alabama,141,"In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the redistribution of the Congress on the basis of the decennial census."
142,0,alabama,142,"This has benefited the urban areas that have developed, as well as the population as a whole that has been underrepresented for more than sixty years."
143,0,alabama,143,Further changes have been made to the establishment of a representative state house and Senate districts.
144,0,alabama,144,"African-Americans continued to lobby in the 1950s and 1960s to end exclusion and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges."
145,0,alabama,145,"In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools should be disaggregated, but Alabama was slow to comply."
146,0,alabama,146,"In the 1960s, under the leadership of Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted federal desegregation requirements."
147,0,alabama,147,"The civil rights movement experienced remarkable events in Alabama, including the boycott of the Montgomery buses (1955-1956), the Freedom Rides in 1961 and the Selma marches in Montgomery in 1965."
148,0,alabama,148,They contributed to the adoption and enactment by the U.S. Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
149,0,alabama,149,"Legal segregation in the states ended in 1964, but Jim Crow's customs often continued until they were specifically challenged in court."
150,0,alabama,150,"According to the New York Times, in 2017, many Afro-Americans from Alabama lived in the cities of Alabama such as Birmingham and Montgomery."
151,0,alabama,151,"In addition, the area of the black belt in the centre of Alabama ""shelters largely poor counties which are mainly African-American."
152,0,alabama,152,"These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."""
153,0,alabama,153,Alabama has made some changes since the end of the 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation.
154,0,alabama,154,"In the 1980s, an omnibus case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, contested the unanimous vote for seats representing 180 alabamas courts, including counties and school boards."
155,0,alabama,155,"Voting in general has diluted the votes of any minority in a county, with the majority tending to take all seats."
156,0,alabama,156,"Although African Americans are an important minority in the state, they have not been able to elect a representative in most jurisdictions in general."
157,0,alabama,157,"As part of the resolution of this case, five cities and counties of Alabama, including Chilton County, have adopted a cumulative voting system for the election of representatives in multiple-seat jurisdictions."
158,0,alabama,158,This resulted in a more proportional representation of voters.
159,0,alabama,159,"In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County."
160,0,alabama,160,"In 1982, the limited vote was first tested in Conecuh County."
161,0,alabama,161,"The use of these systems has led to an increase in the number of African-American women and women elected to local offices, resulting in more representative Governments of their citizens."
162,0,alabama,162,"Alabama is the thirtieth state of the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of the total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in quantity of surface water, also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the United States."
163,0,alabama,163,About three-fifths of the area is a soft plain with a general descent to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.
164,0,alabama,164,"The area of North Alabama is mainly mountainous, with Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating many streams, streams, rivers, mountains and lakes."

175,0,alabama,175,"It is the Wetumpka crater, the site of the largest natural disaster in Alabama."
176,0,alabama,176,A 300-metre-wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.
177,0,alabama,177,"The hills just east of Wetumpka's city centre show the eroded remains of the impact crater that was thrown into the substrate, with the area labeled the crater or astroblem of Wetumpka (""star-wound"") due to concentric rings of fractures and areas of broken rocks that can be found below the surface."
178,0,alabama,178,"In 2002, Christian Koeberl, of the Institute of Geochemistry of the University of Vienna, published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth."

347,0,alabama,347,"The basic document of the Alabama government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901."
348,0,alabama,348,"With nearly 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is, according to some, the longest constitution in the world and 40 times longer than the United States Constitution."
349,0,alabama,349,There was an important movement to rewrite and modernize the Alabama constitution.
350,0,alabama,350,"Critics argue that the constitution of Alabama maintains a highly centralized power with the state's legislative power, leaving virtually no power in local hands."
351,0,alabama,351,Most counties do not have a residence rule.
352,0,alabama,352,"Any proposed policy change in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, often, by state referendum."
353,0,alabama,353,A criticism of the current Constitution affirms that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
354,0,alabama,354,The Alabama government is divided into three equal branches.
355,0,alabama,355,"Legislative power is the Legislative Assembly of Alabama, a bicameral assembly composed of the 105-member House of Representatives of Alabama and the 35-member Senator of Alabama."
356,0,alabama,356,"The Legislative Assembly is responsible for writing, debating, adopting or rejecting the laws of the State."
357,0,alabama,357,The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both chambers of the Legislative Assembly.
358,0,alabama,358,The Legislature has the power to derogate from a veto by a simple majority (most state legislatures need a two-thirds majority to derogate from a veto).
359,0,alabama,359,"Until 1964, state senators were elected by county on a geographical basis, with one per county."
360,0,alabama,360,"Since the adoption of its constitution in 1901, it has not redistributed Congressional constituencies; therefore, urbanized areas are heavily underrepresented."
361,0,alabama,361,Nor has it changed the legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses.
362,0,alabama,362,"In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of ""one man, one voice"", by ruling that Congressional districts should be recomposed on the basis of censuses (as the state had already included in its constitution but had not implemented)."
363,0,alabama,363,"In addition, the Court decided that the two chambers of the legislatures of the bicameral States should be distributed by population, as there was no constitutional basis for States to have geographical systems."
364,0,alabama,364,"At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districts, as many countries had systems that were underrepresented in urban areas and districts."
365,0,alabama,365,This had caused decades of underinvestment in these areas.
366,0,alabama,366,"For example, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes provided one third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of the state's funding."
367,0,alabama,367,"Through legislative delegations, the Alabama Legislative Assembly has maintained control of county governments."
368,0,alabama,368,The executive branch is responsible for the enforcement and control of laws.
369,0,alabama,369,It is headed by the governor of Alabama.
370,0,alabama,370,"Other members of the executive branch include the Cabinet, the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Secretary of State of Alabama, the Treasurer of Alabama State and the Auditor of Alabama."
371,0,alabama,371,The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey.
372,0,alabama,372,Members of Parliament take office immediately after the November elections.
373,0,alabama,373,"Government officials, such as the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General and other constitutional agents, took office the following January."
374,0,alabama,374,The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of the State and applying the law in the criminal and civil cases of the State.
375,0,alabama,375,The highest court in the state is the Supreme Court of Alabama.
376,0,alabama,376,Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges.
377,0,alabama,377,"Since the 1980s, judicial campaigns have been increasingly politicized."
378,0,alabama,378,The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama is Republican Tom Parker.
379,0,alabama,379,All judges in the Supreme Court of Alabama are members of the Republican Party.
380,0,alabama,380,"There are two intermediate courts of appeal, the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal, and four courts of first instance: the Circuit Court (court of first instance of general jurisdiction) and the District, Provincial and Municipal Courts."
381,0,alabama,381,Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an extremely high rate of execution.
382,0,alabama,382,Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country.
383,0,alabama,383,"In a few years, it imposes more death sentences than Texas, a state with a population five times larger."
384,0,alabama,384,"However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas."
385,0,alabama,385,Some of his cases have been very controversial.
386,0,alabama,386,It was the only State to allow judges to disregard jury decisions when applying the death penalty or not.
387,0,alabama,387,This judicial authority was abolished in April 2017.
388,0,alabama,388,Taxes are collected by the Alabama Revenue Department.
389,0,alabama,389,"Alabama collects a tax of 2, 4 or 5% on personal income, depending on the amount earned and the status of production."
390,0,alabama,390,"Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if they take the standard deduction; those who list it can also deduct the FICA tax (social security tax and health insurance)."
391,0,alabama,391,The general rate of the State sales tax is 4%.
392,0,alabama,392,City and county sales tax rates are also added to purchases.
393,0,alabama,393,"For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a dinner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal."
394,0,alabama,394,"In 1999, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 51 per cent of all government and local revenues, compared to an average of about 36 per cent nationally."
395,0,alabama,395,"Alabama is one of the seven states that levy a food tax at the same rate as other goods, and one of the two states (the other is the neighbouring Mississippi) that fully taxes food without any compensatory relief for low-income families."
396,0,alabama,396,(Most states exempt food products from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
397,0,alabama,397,"Alabama's income tax on working poor families is one of the highest in Alabama, the only state that collects income tax on a family of four people whose income is as low as $4,600, or barely a quarter of the federal poverty line."
398,0,alabama,398,The Alabama threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the Columbia district with income taxes.
399,0,alabama,399,The current corporate tax rate is 6.5%.
400,0,alabama,400,"In Alabama, the overall federal, state and local tax burden makes the state the second lowest tax burden in the country."
401,0,alabama,401,Property taxes are the lowest in the United States.
402,0,alabama,402,The current Constitution of the State requires an electoral referendum to increase property tax.
403,0,alabama,403,"Since Alabama's tax structure is largely dependent on consumer spending, it is subject to a high variable budget structure."
404,0,alabama,404,"For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit of $670 million."
405,0,alabama,405,Alabama has 67 counties.
406,0,alabama,406,"Each county has its own elected legislative branch, generally referred to as the county commission."
407,0,alabama,407,It also has limited executive power in the county.
408,0,alabama,408,"Due to the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power within the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby and Tuscaloosa) of the state have a limited domestic regime."
409,0,alabama,409,"Instead, most state counties have to press the Local Legislation Committee of the State Parliament for approval of simple local policies, ranging from waste disposal to land-use zoning."
410,0,alabama,410,"The State legislator retained power over local governments by refusing to adopt a constitutional amendment establishing the county's original regime, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission."
411,0,alabama,411,Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county.
412,0,alabama,412,"In Baker v. Carr (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court demanded that both houses have population-based districts and redistributed after each census, in order to apply the principle of ""one man, one voice""."
413,0,alabama,413,"Before that, each county was represented by a state senator, resulting in under-representation in the State Senate for the more urbanized and populated counties."
414,0,alabama,414,"The rural bias of the state legislature, which had failed to redistribute seats in the state house, affected politics well before the 20th century, not recognizing the growth of industrial cities and urbanized areas."
415,0,alabama,415,"""The absence of a domestic regime for Alabama counties has led to the proliferation of local legislation allowing counties to do things that are not authorized by the state constitution."
416,0,alabama,416,"The constitution of Alabama has been amended more than 700 times, and nearly a third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to a single county or city."
417,0,alabama,417,"A significant part of each legislative session is devoted to local legislation, which removes time and attention from legislators on matters of national importance."""
418,0,alabama,418,"Alabama is a state that controls alcoholic beverages, which means that the state government has a monopoly on the sale of alcohol."
419,0,alabama,419,The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the State.
420,0,alabama,420,"A total of 25 of the 67 counties are ""dry counties"" that prohibit the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in the counties that allow the sale of alcohol."
421,0,alabama,421,"During the post-American civil war reconstruction, Alabama was occupied by federal troops in the third military district under the leadership of General John Pope."
422,0,alabama,422,"In 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as Redemptors took control of the republican state government, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation."
423,0,alabama,423,"After 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to separate and deprive African-American residents, a process completed in the provisions of the 1901 constitution."
424,0,alabama,424,The provisions that deprive blacks of their right to vote have led to the exclusion of many poor whites.
425,0,alabama,425,"In 1941, more whites than blacks had been deprived of their rights: 600,000 to 520,000."
426,0,alabama,426,"The total impact has been greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens have been deprived of their rights and have been relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law."
427,0,alabama,427,"From 1901 to 1960, the state did not redraw electoral districts as the population grew and moved within the state during the urbanization and industrialization of certain regions."
428,0,alabama,428,"As the counties were the basis of the electoral districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated State policy for almost three quarters of the century, until a series of cases before the federal courts had to be redistributed in 1972 to be represented on an equal footing."
429,0,alabama,429,"Alabama State policy received national and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, while whites, bureaucratically and sometimes violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform."
430,0,alabama,430,"Governor George Wallace, the only state governor for four terms, was a controversial figure who committed himself to maintaining segregation."
431,0,alabama,431,"It was only after the adoption of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Electoral Rights Act of 1965 that African Americans regained the capacity to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights."
432,0,alabama,432,"In many countries, they continued to be excluded from representation by electoral systems in general, allowing the majority of the population to dominate the elections."
433,0,alabama,433,Some changes have taken place at the county level as a result of judicial challenges to establish single-member districts that allow for more diverse representation on county councils.
434,0,alabama,434,"In 2007, the Alabama Legislative Assembly voted, and Republican Governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing ""deep regret"" over slavery and its continuing impact."

438,0,alabama,438,"With the abandonment of the Blacks in 1901, the state became an integral part of the ""Solid South"", a system in which the Democratic Party functioned as the only viable political party in every southern state."
439,0,alabama,439,"For almost a hundred years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, usually with only symbolic Republican contestants running for general elections."

Hooper Sr. Hornsby pursued the Alabama and remained in office for almost a year before finally giving up the seat after losing to the court."

453,0,alabama,453,in the state are still held by the democrats.
454,0,alabama,454,"Many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats, resulting in local elections that were decided in the democratic primary."

702,1,alaska,702,"In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.1% non-Hispanic whites), 14.8% Alaska Natives, 5.4% Asians, 3.3% Blacks or African Americans, 1.0% Hawaii Natives and other Pacific Islanders, 1.6% other races and 7.3% two or more races."
703,1,alaska,703,Hispanics or Latinos of any race make up 5.5% of the population.
704,1,alaska,704,"In 2011, 50.7% of the population of Alaska under one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two non-Hispanic white parents)."
705,1,alaska,705,"According to the American Community Survey 2011, 83.4% of people over five years of age spoke only English at home."
706,1,alaska,706,"About 3.5% spoke Spanish at home, 2.2% spoke another Indo-European language, about 4.3% spoke an Asian language (including Tagalog), and about 5.3% spoke other languages at home."
707,1,alaska,707,The Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks states that there are at least 20 native Alaskan languages and that there are also some languages with different dialects.
708,1,alaska,708,"Most of Alaska's Aboriginal languages belong to either Eskimo-Aleoute language families or to na-dene-speaking families; however, some languages are considered isolates (e.g., A."
709,1,alaska,709,Haida) or have not yet been classified (e.g.
710,1,alaska,710,Tsimshianic).
711,1,alaska,711,"In 2014, almost all of Alaska's native languages were considered threatened, changing, moribund, almost extinct or dormant."
712,1,alaska,712,"In total, 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state, known locally as ""Aboriginal languages""."
713,1,alaska,713,"In October 2014, the Governor of Alaska signed a bill officially declaring the 20 Aboriginal languages of the state."
714,1,alaska,714,"This bill has given them symbolic recognition as official languages, although they have not been passed for official purposes within the government."
715,1,alaska,715,The 20 languages that were included in the bill are as follows:
716,1,alaska,716,"According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2010, about 34% of Alaskans were members of religious congregations."
717,1,alaska,717,"100,960 people were identified as evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholics and 32,550 as principal Protestants."
718,1,alaska,718,"About 4% are Mormons, 0.5% Jews, 1% Muslims, 0.5% Buddhists, 0.2% Baha'is and 0.5% Hindus."
719,1,alaska,719,"The largest religious denominations in Alaska in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents, non-denominational evangelical Protestants with 38,070 adherents, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Days Saints with 32,170 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents."
720,1,alaska,720,"Alaska has been identified, as well as the Pacific Pacific States Washington and Oregon, as the least religious states of the United States, in terms of church membership,"
721,1,alaska,721,"In 1795, the first Russian Orthodox church was founded in Kodiak."
722,1,alaska,722,Marriage to Alaskan natives helped Russian immigrants integrate into society.
723,1,alaska,723,"As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches have gradually settled in Alaska."
724,1,alaska,724,Alaska also has the largest population of Quaker (as a percentage) in all states.
725,1,alaska,725,"In 2009, there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for which the observance of the halakha could pose particular problems)."
726,1,alaska,726,"Alaskan Hindus often share places and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains."
727,1,alaska,727,"In 2010, the Hindus of Alaska established the Sri Gansha Temple of Alaska, making it the first Hindu temple in Alaska and the most northerly Hindu temple in the world."
728,1,alaska,728,"It is estimated that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Hindus in Alaska."
729,1,alaska,729,The vast majority of Hindus live in Anchorage or Fairbanks.
730,1,alaska,730,"Estimates for the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000."
731,1,alaska,731,"In the late 1990s, the Anchorage Islamic Community Centre began building a mosque in Anchorage."
732,1,alaska,732,They opened the ground on a building in southern Anchorage in 2010 and were about to be completed by the end of 2014.
733,1,alaska,733,"Once completed, the mosque will be the first of the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world."
734,1,alaska,734,There is also a Bahá'í centre.
735,1,alaska,735,"2018's gross national product was $55 billion, the country's 48th largest."
736,1,alaska,736,"Her personal income per capita for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the country."
737,1,alaska,737,"According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75%."
738,1,alaska,738,"The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the government's revenues from oil extraction."
739,1,alaska,739,"Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is sea fish, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab."
740,1,alaska,740,Agriculture accounts for a very small portion of Alaska's economy.
741,1,alaska,741,"Agricultural production is mainly intended for consumption within the State and includes nurseries, dairy products, vegetables and livestock."
742,1,alaska,742,"Manufacturing is limited, with most food and general goods imported from elsewhere."
743,1,alaska,743,"Employment mainly affects government and industries such as natural resource extraction, marine transportation and transportation."
744,1,alaska,744,"Military bases are an important component of the economy of Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island, and Kodiak."
745,1,alaska,745,"Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low."
746,1,alaska,746,"Industrial products include crude oil, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other extractive industries, seafood processing, wood and wood products."
747,1,alaska,747,There is also a growing service and tourism sector.
748,1,alaska,748,Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local housing.
749,1,alaska,749,"Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted."
750,1,alaska,750,"Significant oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, in February 2014, Alaska fell to fourth place in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota and California."
751,1,alaska,751,"Prudhoe Bay on the northern slope of Alaska is still the second-high-yield oil field in the United States, usually producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although at the beginning of 2014, the Bakken North Dakota Formation produced more than 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d)."
752,1,alaska,752,"Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil deposit ever found in North America, but it was much smaller than the huge Athabasca oil sands deposit in Canada, which in 2014 produced approximately 1,500 000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of productive reserves at that rate."
753,1,alaska,753,"The Trans-Alaska pipeline can carry and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States."
754,1,alaska,754,"In addition, significant coal deposits are found in Alaska's oil, subbituminous, and lignite basins."
755,1,alaska,755,"The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered and technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the northern slope of Alaska."
756,1,alaska,756,Alaska also offers some of the country's highest hydroelectric potential from its many rivers.
757,1,alaska,757,Large stretches of the Alaskan coast also offer wind and geothermal energy potential.
758,1,alaska,758,"Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electricity and light."
759,1,alaska,759,"Although wind and hydro power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for state-wide energy systems (e.g.:"
760,1,alaska,760,"It was found not to be cost-effective (at the time of reporting, 2001) due to low fuel prices (less than 50¢/gal), long distances and low population."
761,1,alaska,761,"The cost of one gallon of gas in urban Alaska is generally thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally much higher, but vary greatly depending on transportation costs, seasonal peaks of use, nearby oil development infrastructure and many other factors."
762,1,alaska,762,"The Alaska Permanent Fund is an appropriation authorized by the Constitution of Oil Revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage the surplus of the state's oil revenues, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans-alaska pipeline network."
763,1,alaska,763,"The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the sale of the Prudhoe Bay lease in 1969, for fear that the legislature would spend all the proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at the same time."
764,1,alaska,764,He was then defended by Governor Jay Hammond and State representative Kenai Hugh Malone.
765,1,alaska,765,"It has always served as an attractive political perspective, diverting the revenues that would normally be deposited into the general fund."
766,1,alaska,766,The Alaskan Constitution has been drafted to discourage the allocation of public funds for a particular purpose.
767,1,alaska,767,"The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mainly because of the political climate of mistrust that existed at the time of its creation."
768,1,alaska,768,"From its initial capital of $734,000, the fund increased to $50 billion due to oil royalties and capital investment programs."
769,1,alaska,769,"Most, if not all, of the capital is invested cautiously outside Alaska."
770,1,alaska,770,"This has led Alaskan politicians to ask the Fund to make investments in Alaska, although such a position has never gained momentum."
771,1,alaska,771,"Beginning in 1982, dividends from the annual growth of the fund were paid each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial amount of $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years of payment, since the distribution of payments was suspended in a distribution plan proceeding) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time amount of $1,200 ""Resource Rebate"")."
772,1,alaska,772,"Each year, the state legislature withdraws 8% of the gains, gives 3% to the capital for proof of inflation, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all eligible Alaskans."
773,1,alaska,773,"To be eligible for the dividend from the Permanent Fund, one must have lived in the State for at least 12 months, maintain permanent residence subject to authorized absences and not be subject to judicial judgements or criminal convictions that fall within various categories of exclusion or may subject the amount of the payment to civil arrest."
774,1,alaska,774,"The Permanent Fund is often seen as one of the main examples of a ""core income"" policy around the world."
775,1,alaska,775,The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the 48 contiguous states.
776,1,alaska,776,"Federal government employees, particularly U.S. Postal Service (USPS) employees and active members, receive a subsistence allowance that is usually set at 25% of basic pay because, although the cost of living has decreased, it remains one of the highest in the country."
777,1,alaska,777,"Rural Alaska has extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to relatively limited transportation infrastructure."
778,1,alaska,778,"Because of the northern climate and the short growing season, there is relatively little agriculture in Alaska."
779,1,alaska,779,"Most farms are located either in the Matanuska Valley, about 64 km northeast of Anchorage, or on the Kenai Peninsula, about 97 km southwest of Anchorage."
780,1,alaska,780,"The short 100-day growing season limits crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons."
781,1,alaska,781,"The main crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce and cabbage."
782,1,alaska,782,"The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural site, particularly the Delta Junction area, about 160 km southeast of Fairbanks, with a large concentration of farms growing agronomic crops, which are mainly to the north and east of Fort Greely."
783,1,alaska,783,This region was largely set aside and developed under a state programme led by Hammond during his second term as governor.
784,1,alaska,784,Crops in the delta region consist mainly of barley and hay.
785,1,alaska,785,"To the west of Fairbanks is another concentration of small farms that deal with restaurants, the hotel and tourism industry, and community-supported agriculture."
786,1,alaska,786,"In recent years, Alaskan agriculture has experienced strong growth in market gardeners, small farms and agricultural markets, with the largest percentage increase (46%) in agricultural market growth in the country in 2011, compared to 17% nationally."
787,1,alaska,787,"The peony industry has also grown, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a supply gap elsewhere in the world, filling a niche in the flower market."
788,1,alaska,788,"Alaska, without county, lacks county fairs."
789,1,alaska,789,"However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with Alaska's largest state fair in Palmer) are held mainly in late summer."
790,1,alaska,790,"The fairs are mainly located in communities with historical or current farming activities, and feature local farmers who exhibit products in addition to more publicized commercial activities such as carnival walks, concerts and food."
791,1,alaska,791,"""Alaska Grown"" is used as an agricultural slogan."
792,1,alaska,792,"Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the main fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific."
793,1,alaska,793,Seafood is one of the few food products that are often cheaper within the state than outside.
794,1,alaska,794,"Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their domestic diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as for sport."
795,1,alaska,795,"This includes fish caught by hook, net or wheel."
796,1,alaska,796,"Subsistence hunting, mainly caribou, moose and Dall's sheep, is still common in the state, particularly in remote Bush communities."
797,1,alaska,797,"An example of traditional indigenous diet is Akutaq, the Eskimo Ice Cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries."
798,1,alaska,798,"Alaska reindeer farming focuses on the Seward Peninsula, where wild caribou can be prevented from mixing and migrating with domesticated reindeer."
799,1,alaska,799,"Most food in Alaska is transported to the state from outside, and shipping costs make food relatively expensive in cities."
800,1,alaska,800,"In rural areas, hunting and subsistence gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitive."
801,1,alaska,801,"Although most of the small towns and villages in Alaska are along the coast, the cost of importing food into remote villages can be high, due to terrain and difficult road conditions, which change significantly due to climate change and precipitation."
802,1,alaska,802,"The cost of transportation can be as much as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult periods, if these places can be reached at all during these adverse weather conditions and terrain conditions."
803,1,alaska,803,"The cost of delivering an American gallon (3.8 L) of milk is approximately $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less."
804,1,alaska,804,"The cost of fuel per gallon is consistently twenty to thirty cents above the United States contiguous average, with only Hawaii having higher prices."
805,1,alaska,805,Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the United States.
806,1,alaska,806,"The state's road network covers a relatively small area of the state, connecting the central population centres and the Alaska Highway, the main exit route to the state across Canada."
807,1,alaska,807,"The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a motor ferry; this has led for decades to a debate about moving the capital to a city on the road network, or the construction of a road link from Haines."
808,1,alaska,808,The western part of Alaska does not have a road network linking communities to the rest of Alaska.
809,1,alaska,809,The interstate highways in Alaska consist of a total of 1082 miles.
810,1,alaska,810,"One of the unique features of Alaska's road network is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, an active Alaskan rail tunnel that has recently been renovated to provide asphalt road connections to the isolated community of Whittier, on Prince William Strait, to the Seward Highway, approximately 80 km southeast of Anchorage, Portage."
811,1,alaska,811,"At 4.0 km, the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007."
812,1,alaska,812,The tunnel is the longest road and rail tunnel in North America.
813,1,alaska,813,"Built around 1915, the Alaskan Railway (ARR) played a key role in Alaska's development during the 20th century."
814,1,alaska,814,"It connects North Pacific vessels by providing critical infrastructure with routes from Seward to the interior of Alaska through south-central Alaska, through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and the North Pole."
815,1,alaska,815,"Cities, villages and the area served by the ARR are known throughout the state as the ""railway belt""."
816,1,alaska,816,"In recent years, the continuous improvement of the asphalt road network has begun to overshadow the importance of the railway to the Alaskan economy."
817,1,alaska,817,"The railway played a vital role in Alaska's development, transporting cargo to Alaska while transporting natural resources south, such as coal from the Usibelli coal mine near Healy at Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley at Anchorage."
818,1,alaska,818,He is well known for his summer tourism service.
819,1,alaska,819,The Alaska Railway was one of the last railways in North America to use cabots in regular service and still use them on some gravel trains.
820,1,alaska,820,It continues to offer one of the last flag-stop roads in the country.
821,1,alaska,821,A section of about 100 km of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road
822,1,alaska,822,"Until the park road was built in the 1970s, the railway provided the only land access to most of the area along its entire route."
823,1,alaska,823,"In northeastern Alaska, the White Pass and Yukon Highway also crosses part of the state from Skagway northward to Canada (British Columbia and Yukon), crossing the border at the White Pass Summit."
824,1,alaska,824,"This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise ship to Skagway."
825,1,alaska,825,It was featured in the 1983 BBC television series Great Little Railways.
826,1,alaska,826,Alaska's rail network is not externally connected.
827,1,alaska,827,"(The closest link to the North American rail network is the northwestern terminus of Canada's National Railway at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, several hundred miles southeast.)"
828,1,alaska,828,"In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and those under the age of 48."
829,1,alaska,829,Some private companies provide float service between Whittier and Seattle.
830,1,alaska,830,"Many towns and villages in the State do not have access to the road or highway; the only modes of access are by air, river or sea."
831,1,alaska,831,"Alaska's well-developed ferry network (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of the southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula."
832,1,alaska,832,Ferries carry both vehicles and passengers.
833,1,alaska,833,"The network also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, in Canada through the inland passage to Skagway."
834,1,alaska,834,The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important maritime link for many communities in the Prince of Wales South East Island area and works in collaboration with Alaska Marine Highway.
835,1,alaska,835,"In recent years, cruise lines have created a summer tourism market, mainly linking northwestern Pacific to southeastern Alaska and, to a lesser extent, cities along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska."
836,1,alaska,836,"The population of Ketchikan, for example, fluctuates considerably over many days – up to four large cruise ships can moor at the same time."
837,1,alaska,837,"Cities not served by road, sea or river can only be reached by air, foot, dog sled or snow machine, representing Alaska's highly developed bush air services, a novelty of Alaska."
838,1,alaska,838,"The Anchorage and, to a lesser extent, Fairbanks are served by many large airlines."
839,1,alaska,839,"Due to limited access to roads, air transport remains the most efficient form of transport within and outside the State."
840,1,alaska,840,"Anchorage recently completed extensive renovation and construction work at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to accommodate the rise of tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska welcomed nearly two million visitors)."
841,1,alaska,841,"Regular flights to most commercially viable villages and cities in the state are difficult to provide, and are heavily subsidized by the federal government under the essential air services program."
842,1,alaska,842,"Alaska Airlines is the only major airline providing air transportation services (sometimes in combination with cargo and passengers Boeing 737-400) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional centres such as Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak and other large communities, as well as to large communities in the southeast and the Alaska Peninsula."
843,1,alaska,843,"Most of the remaining commercial flights come from small regional transportation companies such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir and Frontier Flying Service."
844,1,alaska,844,"Smaller towns and villages have to rely on regular or chartered bush flights using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state."
845,1,alaska,845,"Much of this service can be attributed to Alaska's mail bypass program, which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to rural Alaskan communities."
846,1,alaska,846,The program requires that 70% of this subsidy be granted to carriers providing passenger transportation services to communities.
847,1,alaska,847,Many communities have small air taxi services.
848,1,alaska,848,These operations result from the demand for personalized transportation to remote areas.
849,1,alaska,849,Perhaps the most quintessence plane in Alaska is the bush seaplane.
850,1,alaska,850,"The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights to remote villages without airstrips carry passengers, cargo and many items from warehouse stores and clubs."
851,1,alaska,851,"In 2006, Alaska had the largest number of pilots per capita in any U.S. state."
852,1,alaska,852,Another method of transportation in Alaska is the dog sled.
853,1,alaska,853,"In modern times (i.e., any time after the mid-1920s), dog mushing is more a sport than a real means of transport."
854,1,alaska,854,"Various races are organized around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod sled dog race, a trail of 1,150 miles (1,850 km) from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km)."
855,1,alaska,855,The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum race in Nome in which moshers and dogs like Togo and Balto took medicines very necessary to the community of Nome struck by diphtheria when all the other means of transport had failed.
856,1,alaska,856,"Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage every March to fight for money, prizes and prestige."
857,1,alaska,857,"The ""Serum Run"" is another sled dog race that follows more precisely the route of the famous relay of 1925, starting from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) in Nome."
858,1,alaska,858,"In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by off-road vehicle and winter by snowmobile or ""snow machine"", as is commonly known in Alaska."
859,1,alaska,859,The Internet and other data transport systems in Alaska are largely provided by the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.
860,1,alaska,860,"GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and, at the end of 2011, Alaska Communications announced that it has ""two lines of fiber optics to the 48 minus and two more through Alaska."
861,1,alaska,861,"In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to link Asia and rural Alaska was planned, which was partially supported by $350 million in stimulus to the federal government."
862,1,alaska,862,"Like all other American states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive power composed of the Governor of Alaska and his appointees, who heads the executive departments; a legislative power composed of the House of Representatives of Alaska and Senators of Alaska; and a judicial power composed of the Supreme Court of Alaska and the lower courts."
863,1,alaska,863,"The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people throughout the state."
864,1,alaska,864,The Alaska Legislative Assembly consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senator.
865,1,alaska,865,Senators have a four-year term and two members of the House.
866,1,alaska,866,The Governor of Alaska has a four-year term.
867,1,alaska,867,"The Lieutenant Governor presents himself separately from the Governor in the primaries, but in the general election the candidate for governorship and the candidate for lieutenant governor stand together on the same note."
868,1,alaska,868,"The Alaskan judicial system has four levels: the Alaskan Supreme Court, the Alaskan Court of Appeal, the Superior Courts and the District Courts."
869,1,alaska,869,Superior and district courts are courts of first instance.
870,1,alaska,870,"Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts deal only with certain types of cases, including criminal cases and civil cases with a maximum value of $100,000."
871,1,alaska,871,The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal are courts of appeal.
872,1,alaska,872,"The Court of Appeal is required to hear appeals from certain decisions of the lower courts, including those concerning criminal prosecution, juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus."
873,1,alaska,873,"The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may, at its discretion, hear criminal appeals."
874,1,alaska,874,"Although in its early years of the state of Alaska was a democratic state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as Republican-leaning."
875,1,alaska,875,"Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use planning, fisheries, tourism and individual rights."
876,1,alaska,876,"Alaskan Aboriginal people, although organized in their communities and surrounding areas, have been active in Aboriginal societies."

2414,4,california,2414,"Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including the current Governor Gavin Newsom; however, the state has elected Republican governors, although many of its Republican governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more centrist than the national party."
2415,4,california,2415,Several political movements have advocated Californian independence.
2416,4,california,2416,The California National Party and the California Freedom Coalition are campaigning for Californian independence in the direction of progressivism and civic nationalism.

2522,5,colorado,2522,Colorado's climate is more complex than that of states outside the mountain states region.
2523,5,colorado,2523,"Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado."
2524,5,colorado,2524,"Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains and desert lands."
2525,5,colorado,2525,The surrounding mountains and valleys greatly affect the local climate.
2526,5,colorado,2526,"As a general rule, with an increase in altitude comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation."
2527,5,colorado,2527,"Northeastern, eastern and southeastern Colorado are mostly the high plains, while northern Colorado is a mixture of high plains, foothills and mountains."
2528,5,colorado,2528,"The northwest and west of Colorado are mostly mountainous, with some mixed desert lands."
2529,5,colorado,2529,Southwestern and southern Colorado are a complex mix of desert and mountainous regions.
2530,5,colorado,2530,"The climate of the eastern plains is semi-arid (Köppen climate classification: BSk) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually 15-25 inches (380-640 millimetres) per year."
2531,5,colorado,2531,"The area is known for its abundant sun and cool and light nights, which gives this region a large range of average daytime temperature."
2532,5,colorado,2532,"The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable because the heat dissipates in the space during the clear nights, since the thermal radiation is not trapped by the clouds."
2533,5,colorado,2533,"The Front Range urban corridor, home to most of Colorado's population, is in a heavy rain shadow because it is on the lee side of the Rocky Mountains."
2534,5,colorado,2534,"In summer, this area may have many days above 95°F (35°C) and often 100°F (38°C)."
2535,5,colorado,2535,"In the plains, winter hollows generally range from 25 to -10°F (−4 to -23°C)."
2536,5,colorado,2536,"Approximately 75% of precipitation occurs during the growing season, from April to September, but this region is highly prone to drought."
2537,5,colorado,2537,"Most precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and large snowstorms that occur in winter and early spring."
2538,5,colorado,2538,"Otherwise, winters tend to be generally dry and cold."
2539,5,colorado,2539,"In much of the region, Mars is the most snowy month."
2540,5,colorado,2540,"April and May are normally the wettest months, while April is the wettest month in total."
2541,5,colorado,2541,"Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in winter due to Chinook winds that warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70°F (21°C) or higher in winter."
2542,5,colorado,2542,The mean July temperature is 55°F (13°C) in the morning and 90°F (32°C) in the afternoon.
2543,5,colorado,2543,"The mean January temperature is 18°F (−8°C) in the morning and 48°F (9°C) in the afternoon, although the variation between consecutive days may be 40°F (20°C)."
2544,5,colorado,2544,"Just west of the plains and in the foothills, there is a wide variety of climatic types."
2545,5,colorado,2545,Locations a few kilometres apart may experience a completely different time depending on the topography.
2546,5,colorado,2546,"Most valleys have a semi-arid climate that is no different from the eastern plains, which passes to an alpine climate at the highest altitudes."
2547,5,colorado,2547,"There are also microclimates in local areas that cover almost the full range of climates, including subtropical highlands (Cfb/Cwb), wet subtropicals (Cfa), wet continentals (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterraneans (Csa/Csb) and subarctics (Dfc)."
2548,5,colorado,2548,"Extreme climate change is common in Colorado, although a significant portion of extreme climate change occurs in the least populated areas of the state."
2549,5,colorado,2549,"Storms are common east of the continental ditch in spring and summer, but are generally short."
2550,5,colorado,2550,"The hail is a common view in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern plains, especially the northeastern part of the state."
2551,5,colorado,2551,Hail is the most commonly reported serious weather hazard for the warm season and can cause human injury and significant damage to property.
2552,5,colorado,2552,The eastern plains are subject to some of the largest hailstorms in North America.
2553,5,colorado,2553,"An example is the violent hailstorms that struck Denver on July 11, 1990 and May 8, 2017, the latter being the most expensive in the state."
2554,5,colorado,2554,"The eastern plains are part of the extreme west of the Tornado gangway; some harmful tornadoes on the eastern plains include the 1990 Limon F3 tornado and the Windsor EF3 tornado, which devastated the small town in 2008."
2555,5,colorado,2555,"Portions of the eastern plains see particularly frequent tornadoes, both those that have spawned from mesocyclones in supercell storms and those that come from less intense tillage, as in the Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone (DCVZ)."
2556,5,colorado,2556,"The plains are also exposed to occasional flooding and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused by both thunderstorms and the rapid melting of snow in the mountains in warm weather."
2557,5,colorado,2557,"The 1965 floods in the Denver River, the 1976 floods in the Big Thompson River and Colorado in 2013 are notable examples."
2558,5,colorado,2558,Hot weather is common during the summers in Denver.
2559,5,colorado,2559,The city's record in 1901 for consecutive days above 90°F (32°C) was broken in the summer of 2008.
2560,5,colorado,2560,The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record of almost a week.
2561,5,colorado,2561,"Much of Colorado is very dry, with the average condition of only 17 inches (430 millimetres) of precipitation per year on a state-wide basis."
2562,5,colorado,2562,The state rarely experiences a period when part of it is not to some extent drought.
2563,5,colorado,2563,"The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of forest fires in the state, such as the 2002 Hayman Fire."
2564,5,colorado,2564,"Other notable fires include the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire, the Waldo Canyon Fire and the June 2012 High Park Fire, and the June 2013 Black Forest Fire."
2565,5,colorado,2565,"Even these fires were overtaken by the pine mulch fire, the Cameron Peak fire, and the Eastern Troublefire in 2020, all of which are the three largest fires in Colorado history (see Colorado Forest Fires in 2020)."
2566,5,colorado,2566,"However, some of Colorado's mountainous regions receive a large amount of moisture from winter snowfall."
2567,5,colorado,2567,"The spring melting of these snows often causes large flows of water in the Yampa River, Colorado River, Rio Grande, Arkansas River, North Platte River and South Platte River."
2568,5,colorado,2568,"Water flowing from the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very important source of water for farms, cities and cities in southwestern New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada, as well as for the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas."
2569,5,colorado,2569,A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and regularly) water flows reach northern Mexico.
2570,5,colorado,2570,"The highest official ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was 115°F (46.1°C) on July 20, 2019, at the John Martin Dam."
2571,5,colorado,2571,The lowest official air temperature was −61°F (−51.7°C) on 1 February 1985 in Maybell.
2572,5,colorado,2572,"Despite its mountainous terrain, Colorado is relatively calm from the seismic point of view."

2574,5,colorado,2574,"On August 22, 2011, an earthquake of magnitude 5.3 occurred 14 km west-southwest of the city of Trinidad."
2575,5,colorado,2575,There were no casualties and only a small number of damage was reported.
2576,5,colorado,2576,It was the second earthquake in Colorado's history.
2577,5,colorado,2577,An earthquake of magnitude 5.7 was recorded in 1973.
2578,5,colorado,2578,"In the early morning of August 24, 2018, four minor earthquakes caught up with the state of Colorado ranging from magnitude 2.9 to 4.3."

2581,5,colorado,2581,The Lindenmeier site in Larimer County contains artifacts dating from approximately 11200 B.C. to 3000 B.C.
2582,5,colorado,2582,The eastern end of the Rockies was an important migratory route that was important for the spread of the first peoples throughout the Americas.
2583,5,colorado,2583,The former Pueblo peoples lived in the valleys and mesas of the Colorado plateau.
2584,5,colorado,2584,"The Ute Nation has inhabited the valleys of the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Western Rocky Mountains, even to the east of the Front Range these days."
2585,5,colorado,2585,The Apaches and the Comanches also lived in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the state.

3342,7,delaware,3342,"Before the Europeans explored its coastline in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Amerindians, including Lenape to the north and Nanticoke to the south."
3343,7,delaware,3343,"It was first colonized by Dutch traders in Zwaanendael, near the present town of Lewes, in 1631."

3357,7,delaware,3357,"Delaware, along with Maryland County East Coast and two counties of Virginia, forms the Delmarva Peninsula, which extends along the mid-Atlantic coast."
3358,7,delaware,3358,The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual.
3359,7,delaware,3359,The bulk of the Delaware-Penna border was originally defined by an arc extending 12.3 km from the New Castle City Courthouse dome.
3360,7,delaware,3360,This limit is often called the circle of twelve miles.
3361,7,delaware,3361,"Although the circle of twelve miles is often considered the only territorial border in the United States that is a true arc, the Mexican border with Texas includes several arches, and many southern cities (such as the plains, Georgia) also have circular borders."
3362,7,delaware,3362,"This boundary extends to the east to the low point on the shore of New Jersey, then continues south along the shore until it again reaches the 12 mile (19 km) arc in the south; then the boundary continues more conventionally in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River."
3363,7,delaware,3363,"To the west, part of the arc extends beyond the eastern end of Maryland."
3364,7,delaware,3364,The rest of the western border runs slightly east of the south from its intersection with the arc.
3365,7,delaware,3365,"Land between the northwestern portion of the arc and the Maryland border is claimed by Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim is confirmed."

3369,7,delaware,3369,"The fall line of the Atlantic coast follows approximately Robert Kirkwood Road between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road lies the Atlantic coastal plain with flat, sandy soil and, in some parts, marshy."
3370,7,delaware,3370,A ridge of approximately 75 to 80 feet (23 to 24 m) extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the watersheds that feed the Delaware River from the bay to the east and Chesapeake Bay to the west.

3382,7,delaware,3382,"Delaware provides government subsidies for the clean-up of ""lightly contaminated"" property with hazardous waste, the product of which comes from a wholesale oil sales tax."
3383,7,delaware,3383,"Before the Delaware was colonized by European settlers, the region housed the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mainly along the coast, and the Nanticokes who occupied much of the southern Delmarva peninsula."
3384,7,delaware,3384,"John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of Nanticoke, who may have kept small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating to Chesapeake Bay."
3385,7,delaware,3385,The Kuskarawocks were probably the Tuscarora.
3386,7,delaware,3386,The Unami Lenape of the Delaware Valley were closely related to the Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River.
3387,7,delaware,3387,"They had an established hunting and farming society, and they quickly became involved in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their former enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock."
3388,7,delaware,3388,"With the loss of their land on the Delaware River and the destruction of Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wanted to remain identified as such left the region and moved to the Alleghany Mountains in the mid-18th century."
3389,7,delaware,3389,"In general, those who did not move out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christians and were regrouped with other colored people in official documents and in the minds of their non-Aboriginal American neighbours."
3390,7,delaware,3390,"The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the current Delaware in the Middle Region by establishing a trading post in Zwaanendael, near the Lewes site in 1631."
3391,7,delaware,3391,"In less than a year, all settlers were killed in a dispute with American Aboriginal tribes."
3392,7,delaware,3392,"In 1638, a new Sweden, a trading post and a Swedish colony was established in Fort Christina (now Wilmington) by Peter Minuit as head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch."
3393,7,delaware,3393,The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years.
3394,7,delaware,3394,"In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at the present time New Castle, and in 1655 they conquered the colony of New Sweden, annexing it to the Dutch New Land."
3395,7,delaware,3395,"Nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York."
3396,7,delaware,3396,"Combating an earlier claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, owner of Maryland, the Duke passed on his somewhat doubtful property to William Penn in 1682."
3397,7,delaware,3397,"Penn was keen to access the sea for his province of Pennsylvania and rented what was then known as the Duke's ""Delaware Low Counties""."
3398,7,delaware,3398,Penn established a representative government and briefly combined its two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682.
3399,7,delaware,3399,"However, in 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had grown so widely that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the consent of the lower counties, and the two groups of representatives began to meet alone, one in Philadelphia, and the other in New Castle."
3400,7,delaware,3400,Penn and his heirs remained owners of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory in the lower counties.
3401,7,delaware,3401,The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique.
3402,7,delaware,3402,From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.
3403,7,delaware,3403,Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.
3404,7,delaware,3404,"Depending on the first years of contract work, Delaware imports more slaves as the number of English immigrants declines with better economic conditions in England."
3405,7,delaware,3405,"The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a market culture, although English immigrants continued to arrive."
3406,7,delaware,3406,"Like the other middle colonies, the lower counties of Delaware first showed little enthusiasm for a breakup with Britain."
3407,7,delaware,3407,"Citizens had good relations with the owner government, and they were generally granted more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies."
3408,7,delaware,3408,The merchants at Wilmington harbour had commercial ties with the British.
3409,7,delaware,3409,"Thus New Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the stamp law in the strongest terms, and John Dickinson, from Kent County, became the ""Penman of the Revolution""."
3410,7,delaware,3410,"Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, patriotic leaders Thomas McKean and César Rodney convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separate from British domination and Pennsylvania on 15 June 1776."
3411,7,delaware,3411,"The person who best represented Delaware's majority, George Read, could not vote for a declaration of independence."
3412,7,delaware,3412,Only Caesar Rodney's spectacular night trip gave the delegation the necessary votes to vote Delaware for independence.
3413,7,delaware,3413,"Originally led by John Haslet, Delaware provided one of the first regiments of the Continental Army, known as the Blues Delaware and known as the Blue Hen Chicks."
3414,7,delaware,3414,In August 1777 General Sir William Howe led a British army through Delaware on his way to victory at the Battle of Brandywine and the capture of the city of Philadelphia.
3415,7,delaware,3415,"The only real commitment to Delaware was the Battle of the Cooch Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777 at the Cooch Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a minor Loyalist rebellion in 1778."
3416,7,delaware,3416,"After the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and State President John McKinly was taken prisoner."
3417,7,delaware,3417,"The British remained masters of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting trade and encouraging an active part of the Loyalist population, particularly in Sussex County."
3418,7,delaware,3418,"Because the British promised the slaves of the rebels the freedom to fight with them, the escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines."
3419,7,delaware,3419,"After the American Revolution, Delaware's statesmen were among the main supporters of a strong United States centre with equal representation for each state."
3420,7,delaware,3420,"Many colonialist settlers came to the Delaware of Maryland and Virginia, where the population had grown rapidly."
3421,7,delaware,3421,The economies of these colonies were mainly based on labour-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves because of a decline in working-class immigrants in England.
3422,7,delaware,3422,"Most English settlers had arrived as contract servants (contracted for a specified period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between the servant and the slave was fluid."
3423,7,delaware,3423,Most of the Afro-American families free from Delaware before the Revolution had emigrated from Maryland to find more affordable land.
3424,7,delaware,3424,"They were mainly the result of relationships or marriages between white maids and free African or African American slaves, servants or men."
3425,7,delaware,3425,"Under the Slavery Act, children took on the social status of their mothers, so that children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, as were children born to slave women."
3426,7,delaware,3426,"While the flow of workers engaged to the colony decreased with the improvement of economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and caste lines hardened."
3427,7,delaware,3427,"At the end of the colonial period, the number of people enslaved to Delaware began to decrease."
3428,7,delaware,3428,The shift of the agricultural economy from tobacco to mixed farming has reduced the need for slave labour.
3429,7,delaware,3429,"In addition, local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaves to free their slaves after the American Revolution, and many did so in a wave of individual manufactures for idealistic reasons."
3430,7,delaware,3430,"In 1810, three-quarters of all Delaware Blacks were free."
3431,7,delaware,3431,"When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was the largest slave owner of Delaware with 37 slaves."
3432,7,delaware,3432,"In 1860, the largest slave owner owned 16 slaves."
3433,7,delaware,3433,"Although attempts to abolish slavery had failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practice the State had for the most part put an end to that practice."
3434,7,delaware,3434,"In the 1860 census on the brink of civil war, 91.7 per cent of the black population was free; 1,798 were slaves, compared with 19,829 ""free-coloured people""."
3435,7,delaware,3435,"In 1813, a free slave Peter Spencer made the Church of the Union of Africans a black independent denomination."
3436,7,delaware,3436,"This followed the establishment in Philadelphia in 1793 of the African Methodist Episcopal Church by Richard Allen, who had links with the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816."
3437,7,delaware,3437,Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.
3438,7,delaware,3438,"It has been renamed the First Colour Protestant Methodist Church and Connection of the African Union, more commonly known as A.U.M.P."
3439,7,delaware,3439,The church.
3440,7,delaware,3440,"In 1814 Spencer called for the first annual meeting, known as Big August Quarterly, which continues to bring together the members of this confession and their descendants in a religious and cultural festival."
3441,7,delaware,3441,Delaware voted against secession on 3 January 1861 and thus remained in the Union.
3442,7,delaware,3442,"While most of the Delaware citizens who fought during the war served in the state regiments, some served in companies on the Confederate side in the regiments of Maryland and Virginia."
3443,7,delaware,3443,Delaware is remarkable because it is the only slave state from which no Confederate regiment or militia group has been assembled.
3444,7,delaware,3444,"The Delaware essentially released the few slaves who were still in servitude shortly after the civil war, but rejected the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution; the 13th amendment was rejected on 8 February 1865; the 14th amendment was rejected on 8 February 1867; and the 15th amendment was rejected on 18 March 1869."
3445,7,delaware,3445,"Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments on 12 February 1901."
3446,7,delaware,3446,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Delaware population was 973,764 on July 1, 2019, an 8.4% increase from the 2010 U.S. Census."
3447,7,delaware,3447,The history of Delaware as a border state has led it to have characteristics of the northern and southern parts of the United States.
3448,7,delaware,3448,"In general, the rural areas of the south (or ""low"" Delaware) under the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal embody a southern culture, while the densely populated northern Delaware above the Canal — particularly Wilmington, part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area — is more in common with that of the northeast."
3449,7,delaware,3449,"The U.S. Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the states of the South Atlantic, but is generally associated with the states of the Middle Atlantic and/or the Northeast of the United States by other federal agencies, the media and some residents."
3450,7,delaware,3450,"According to the 2010 United States Census, Delaware had a population of 897,934."
3451,7,delaware,3451,The racial composition of the State was as follows:
3452,7,delaware,3452,"Ethnically, Hispanics and Latinos of all races represented 8.2% of the population."
3453,7,delaware,3453,"Delaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile higher than the national average, and ranked 45th in the population."
3454,7,delaware,3454,"Delaware is one of five states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population of more than 100,000 at the 2010 census."
3455,7,delaware,3455,"Delaware's population centre is in New Castle County, Townsend City."
3456,7,delaware,3456,"In 2011, 49.7% of Delaware's population under one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e. did not have two non-Hispanic white parents)."
3457,7,delaware,3457,"In 2000, approximately 19 per cent of the population was African-American and 5 per cent of the population was Hispanic (mainly Puerto Rican or Mexican)."
3458,7,delaware,3458,"Note: Births in the table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and race, giving a higher overall number."
3459,7,delaware,3459,"In 2000, 91% of Delaware residents aged 5 and over spoke English only at home; 5% spoke Spanish."
3460,7,delaware,3460,"French was the third most spoken language at 0.7%, followed by Chinese at 0.5% and German at 0.5%."
3461,7,delaware,3461,Legislation had been proposed in the House of Commons and the Senator of Delaware to designate English as the official language.
3462,7,delaware,3462,No bill has been passed in the Legislative Assembly.
3463,7,delaware,3463,"In 2014, Delaware was mainly Christian."
3464,7,delaware,3464,"Although Protestants make up almost half of the population, the Catholic Church is the largest denomination in the state."
3465,7,delaware,3465,"The Association of Religion Data Archives reported in 2010 that the three largest denominational groups of Delaware by the number of adherents are the Catholic Church with 182,532 adherents, the Methodist Church united with 53,656 reported members, and Evangelical Protestant non-confessional with 22,973 reported adherents."
3466,7,delaware,3466,"The religious body with the largest number of congregations is the United Methodist Church (with 158 congregations), followed by non-denominational evangelical Protestants (with 106 congregations), then the Catholic Church (with 45 congregations)."
3467,7,delaware,3467,The Catholic Diocese of Wilmington and the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware oversee the parishes in their denominations.
3468,7,delaware,3468,The A.U.M.P.
3469,7,delaware,3469,"The church, the nation's oldest African-American denomination, was founded in Wilmington."

3471,7,delaware,3471,"Reflecting new immigrant populations, an Islamic mosque was built in the Ogletown area and a Hindu temple in Hocksin."
3472,7,delaware,3472,"Delaware is home to an Amish community that resides west of Dover in Kent County, consisting of nine religious districts and about 1650 people."
3473,7,delaware,3473,The Amish settled for the first time in Kent County in 1915.
3474,7,delaware,3474,"In recent years, increased development has led to a decrease in the number of amish people living in the community."
3475,7,delaware,3475,"A 2012 survey of religious attitudes in the United States found that 34% of Delaware residents considered themselves to be ""moderately religious"", 33% to be ""very religious"" and 33% to be ""non-religious""."
3476,7,delaware,3476,"A 2012 Gallup poll revealed that Delaware's adult lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender was 3.4 per cent of the population."

3478,7,delaware,3478,"In 2010, the number of same-sex households was 2,646."

3480,7,delaware,3480,"On 1 July 2013, same-sex marriage was legalized and all civil unions will be converted into marriages."

3483,7,delaware,3483,"In October 2019, the state unemployment rate was 3.7%."
3484,7,delaware,3484,The main employers of the State are:
3485,7,delaware,3485,"Since the mid-2000s Delaware has seen the departure of the state's automotive manufacturing industry (General Motors Wilmington Assembly and Chrysler Newark Assembly), the acquisition of a large bank holding company (MBNA), the departure of the state's steel industry (Evraz Claymont Steel), the bankruptcy of a fibre factory (National Vulcanized Fibre) and the decrease in the presence of AstraZeneca in Wilmington."
3486,7,delaware,3486,"At the end of 2015, DuPont announced that 1,700 employees, almost a third of its Delaware footprint, would be laid off in early 2016."
3487,7,delaware,3487,The merger of E.I.
3488,7,delaware,3488,"Nemours & Co. Bridge and Dow Chemical Company in DowDuPont took place on September 1, 2017."
3489,7,delaware,3489,"More than half of the U.S. listed companies, and 63% of the Fortune 500, are incorporated into Delaware."
3490,7,delaware,3490,The attractiveness of the state as a corporate paradise is largely due to its company law favourable to business.
3491,7,delaware,3491,The franchise taxes on Delaware companies provide about a fifth of the government's revenues.
3492,7,delaware,3492,"Although ""USA (Delaware)"" has ranked itself as the most opaque jurisdiction in the world on the Tax Justice Network's 2009 financial secret index, the 2011 index of the same group ranks fifth in the United States and does not specify Delaware."
3493,7,delaware,3493,"At Delaware, there are more than a million registered companies, which means that there are more companies than people."
3494,7,delaware,3494,"Chapter 7 of Title 4 of the Delaware Code states that alcoholic beverages must only be sold in expressly licensed establishments, and only between 9 a.m. and 1 a.m. Until 2003, Delaware was one of the different states applying blue laws and prohibited the sale of alcohol on Sundays."
3495,7,delaware,3495,"The Delaware transport system is under the governance and supervision of the Delaware Transport Department, also known as DelDOT."
3496,7,delaware,3496,"The DelDOT projects are funded in part from the Delaware Transport Trust Fund, established in 1987 to help stabilize transport financing; the availability of the Trust Fund has led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware State operations."
3497,7,delaware,3497,"DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware public highway adoption program, snow removal of main roads, traffic control infrastructure (signals and signals), toll road management, Delaware Motor Vehicle Division, Delaware Transit Corporation (called ""DART First State"", the state's public transport agency), among others."
3498,7,delaware,3498,"In 2009, DelDOT maintained 13,507 miles, totalling 89 per cent of the state's public road network, the remainder under the supervision of individual municipalities."
3499,7,delaware,3499,This far exceeds the national average (20 per cent) for the maintenance responsibility of the Department of State for Transport.
3500,7,delaware,3500,"One of the main branches of the Interstate Highway System in the United States, Interstate 95 (I-95), crosses New Castle County."

3502,7,delaware,3502,"There are also several state roads that cross the state of Delaware; some of them include DE 1, DE 9 and DE 404."
3503,7,delaware,3503,"US 13 and DE 1 are major north-south highways linking Wilmington and Pennsylvania to Maryland, with DE 1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and Delaware beaches."

3507,7,delaware,3507,"The state also operates three toll highways, Delaware Turnpike, which is I-95, between Maryland and New Castle; Korea War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE 1, between Wilmington and Dover; and the U.S. toll road 301 between the Maryland and DE 1 border in New Castle County."
3508,7,delaware,3508,"A bike path, Delaware Bicycle Route 1, extends along the north-south length of the state from the Maryland border at Fenwick Island to the Pennsylvania border north of Montchanin."
3509,7,delaware,3509,This is the first of several signed bike routes planned at Delaware.
3510,7,delaware,3510,"Delaware has about 1,450 bridges, 95 percent of which are under DelDOT's supervision."
3511,7,delaware,3511,"About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built before 1950, and about 60 percent of these are included in the national bridge inventory."
3512,7,delaware,3512,"Some bridges that are not under DelDOT supervision include the four bridges on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which are under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers, and the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which is under the bi-state Delaware River and Bay Authority."
3513,7,delaware,3513,It was noted that the tar and chip composition of secondary roads in Sussex County makes them more prone to deterioration than asphalt roads in almost the rest of the state.
3514,7,delaware,3514,"Among these roads, the Sussex (County Road) 236 is one of the most problematic."
3515,7,delaware,3515,Three ferries operate in the state of Delaware:
3516,7,delaware,3516,"Amtrak has two stations in Delaware along the northeast corridor; Newark's relatively quiet railway station in Newark, and Wilmington's railway station in Wilmington."
3517,7,delaware,3517,"The northeast corridor is also served by SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Regional Line, which serves Claymont, Wilmington, Churchmans Crossing and Newark."
3518,7,delaware,3518,"Two Class I railways, Norfolk Southern and CSX, provide freight rail service in northern New Castle County."
3519,7,delaware,3519,"Norfolk Southern provides freight services along the northeast corridor and in the industrial areas of Edgemoor, New Castle and Delaware City."
3520,7,delaware,3520,CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision crosses north of New Castle County in parallel with the north-east corridor of Amtrak.
3521,7,delaware,3521,Several short-distance railway lines provide freight service to Delaware.
3522,7,delaware,3522,"Delmarva's central railway operates the most short-line railway lines, ranging from an exchange with Norfolk Southern to Porter via Dover, Harrington and Seaford to Delmar, with another line from Harrington to Frankford and from Ellendale to Milton and Georgetown to Gravel Hill."
3523,7,delaware,3523,"Delmarva Central Railway is connected to Maryland and Delaware Railway, which serves local customers in Sussex County."
3524,7,delaware,3524,"CSX connects to freight and heritage operations, Wilmington and Western Railroad, based in Wilmington, and East Penn Railroad, which operates a line from Wilmington to Coatesville, Pennsylvania."
3525,7,delaware,3525,The last north-south passenger train crossing the main part of the Delaware was the local Wilmington-Delmar train from Pennsylvania Railroad in 1965.
3526,7,delaware,3526,"He was a successor to Del-Mar-Va Express and the Cavalier, who had headed from Philadelphia to the interior of the state until the end of the Delmarva Peninsula until the mid-1950s."
3527,7,delaware,3527,"In 2003, the American Public Transportation Association named the DART First State's most exceptional public transportation network."
3528,7,delaware,3528,"The network is widely covered in northern New Castle County, and is closely linked to major roads in Kent and Sussex counties."
3529,7,delaware,3529,"The system includes buses, subsidized passenger trains operated by the Philadelphia SEPTA transport agency, and subsidized taxi and public transit modes."
3530,7,delaware,3530,"The adapted transportation system, which consists of a door-to-door bus service for the elderly and persons with disabilities nationally, was described by a report from the State of Delaware as ""the most generous adapted transportation system in the United States""."
3531,7,delaware,3531,"Since 2012, public transit charges have not changed since 1988."
3532,7,delaware,3532,"Since 2016, there has been no scheduled air service from a Delaware airport, as has been the case since 1991."
3533,7,delaware,3533,"Various airlines had served Wilmington Airport, the last departure being Frontier Airlines in April 2015."
3534,7,delaware,3534,Delaware is located in the northeastern megapolis of the cities along the I-95.
3535,7,delaware,3535,"As a result, Delaware commercial airline passengers most often use Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Baltimore-Washington Thurgood Marshall International Airport (BWI) and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) for domestic and international transit."
3536,7,delaware,3536,Sussex County residents will also use the Wicomico Regional Airport (SBY) as it is less than 10 miles (16 km) from the Delaware border.
3537,7,delaware,3537,"Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) are also within 160 km of New Castle County."

3550,7,delaware,3550,Non-constitutional juvenile courts include the justice of the courts of the peace and the courts of the aldermen.
3551,7,delaware,3551,"Significantly, Delaware has one of the nation's few chancery courts, which have jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many of which relate to mergers and acquisitions."
3552,7,delaware,3552,The Chancery Court and the Delaware Supreme Court have gained a global reputation for the formulation of concise opinions on corporate law that generally (but not always) give broad discretion to boards of directors and corporate directors.
3553,7,delaware,3553,"In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law, which forms the basis of the views of the courts, is widely regarded as giving companies great flexibility in managing their affairs."
3554,7,delaware,3554,"For these reasons, Delaware is considered to be the most favourable legal system for companies in the United States; therefore, a large number of companies are incorporated into Delaware, including 60 per cent of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange."
3555,7,delaware,3555,Delaware was the last U.S. state to resort to judicial corporal punishment in 1952.
3556,7,delaware,3556,The Executive is headed by the Governor of Delaware.
3557,7,delaware,3557,"The current Governor is John Carney (Democrat), who took office on January 17, 2017."
3558,7,delaware,3558,The Lieutenant Governor is Bethany Hall-Long.
3559,7,delaware,3559,"The Governor delivers a speech on the ""State of the State"" at a joint session of the Delaware legislature every year."
3560,7,delaware,3560,"Delaware is subdivided into three counties: from north to south, they are New Castle, Kent and Sussex."
3561,7,delaware,3561,It is the smallest of all states.
3562,7,delaware,3562,"Each county elects its own legislative body (known in the counties of New Castle and Sussex as the county council, and in Kent County as the Levy Court), which deals primarily with zoning and development issues."
3563,7,delaware,3563,"Most of the functions that are performed by county and county in other states, such as courts and law enforcement, have been centralized in Delaware, resulting in a significant concentration of powers within the Delaware State Government."
3564,7,delaware,3564,"The counties have historically been divided into hundreds, which were used as tax and electoral boundaries up to the 1960s, but now do not serve as an administrative role, their only current legal use being in real estate title descriptions."
3565,7,delaware,3565,The Democratic Party holds a plurality of registrations at Delaware.
3566,7,delaware,3566,"Until the 2000 presidential election, the state tended to be a presidential gazette, sending its three electoral votes to the winning candidate since 1952."
3567,7,delaware,3567,This trend ended in 2000 when Delaware's electoral votes reached Al Gore by 13 percentage points.
3568,7,delaware,3568,"In 2004, John Kerry won the Delaware by eight percentage points."

3574,7,delaware,3574,"Currently, the Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware, including the senator and the House."
3575,7,delaware,3575,"The shift from Delaware to Democrats is partly due to a strong democratic trend in New Castle County, which has 55% of the Delaware population (the two smallest counties have only 359,000 people among them for the 535,000 in New Castle County)."
3576,7,delaware,3576,New Castle County has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988.
3577,7,delaware,3577,"In 1992, 2000, 2004 and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by two digits each time in New Castle County, which was a sufficient margin to shift the state towards the Democrats."
3578,7,delaware,3578,New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the legislature
3579,7,delaware,3579,"The Democrats have held the post of governor since 1993, after winning the last seven consecutive elections."
3580,7,delaware,3580,"The Democrats currently occupy the nine state-wide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two state-wide offices in 2014, the State Auditor and the State Treasurer."
3581,7,delaware,3581,"Each of the 50 states in the United States has adopted some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information from the government."
3582,7,delaware,3582,"In 2011, Delaware passed a law setting a time limit of 15 working days for processing requests for freedom of information, either to produce information or to explain why this information would be longer than that time limit."
3583,7,delaware,3583,The tax is collected by the Revenue Division of Delaware.
3584,7,delaware,3584,"Delaware has six different tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95 percent."
3585,7,delaware,3585,The State does not assess the sales tax on consumers.
3586,7,delaware,3586,"However, the State imposes a tax on the gross revenues of most enterprises."

4294,9,georgia,4294,"From the Atlantic Ocean, the eastern border of the state with South Carolina dates back to Savannah, from the northwest to the confluence of the Tugaloo and Senatorca rivers."
4295,9,georgia,4295,"It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and in the Chattooga River, its most important tributary."
4296,9,georgia,4296,These limits were decided in the Treaty of Beaufort of 1797 and tested by the Supreme Court of the United States in the two Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989.
4297,9,georgia,4297,"The boundary then turns abruptly around the end of Rabun County at 35° north latitude, although from this point it diverges slightly southward (due to inaccuracies in the initial survey)."
4298,9,georgia,4298,"This northern border was originally the border of Georgia and North Carolina to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was separated from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies prompted the Georgian legislature to pass a law, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell most of Georgia's territory, which currently includes Alabama and Mississippi."
4299,9,georgia,4299,The western boundary of the state extends straight to the southeast from a point southwest of Chattanooga to the Chattahoochee River near West Point.
4300,9,georgia,4300,"It continues downwards to the point where it joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming the Apalachicola River of Florida); the southern border goes almost full east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the St. Mary's River, which then forms the rest of the border back to the ocean."
4301,9,georgia,4301,Water limits are always set to be the original thalweg of rivers.
4302,9,georgia,4302,"Since then, several lakes have been flooded by dams, including Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint under Seminole Lake."
4303,9,georgia,4303,"Georgian legislators have claimed that, during an investigation in 1818, the state border with Tennessee was wrongly placed a mile (1.6 km) further south than expected, and they continue to challenge it."
4304,9,georgia,4304,Correcting this inaccuracy would allow Georgia access to Tennessee water.
4305,9,georgia,4305,Each region has its own characteristics.
4306,9,georgia,4306,"For example, the ridge and valley, located in the northwest corner of the state, include limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which produced building limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal."
4307,9,georgia,4307,The Georgian state has about 250 species of trees and 58 protected plants.

4321,9,georgia,4321,"The extent to which the time of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, and altitude."
4322,9,georgia,4322,"This latter factor occurs mainly in mountainous areas in the northern part of the State, which are more distant from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level."
4323,9,georgia,4323,The hardiness zones of USDA plants for Georgia range from zone 6b (not colder than -5°F (−21°C)) in the Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b (not colder than 15°F (−9°C)) along the Atlantic coast and the Florida border.
4324,9,georgia,4324,"The highest temperature ever recorded was 112°F (44.4°C) at Louisville on 24 July 1952, while the lowest was −17°F (−27.2°C) in northern Floyd County on 27 January 1940."

4326,9,georgia,4326,"Although the tornadoes that hit the city are very rare, an EF2 tornado hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings."
4327,9,georgia,4327,"With a coast on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare in the 20th century."
4328,9,georgia,4328,"Georgia is often hit by hurricanes that hit the Florida Panhandle, weaken on land and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rains inside, a recent example being Hurricane Michael, as well as hurricanes that are approaching the Georgian coast, brushing the coast on their way north without ever landing."
4329,9,georgia,4329,Hurricane Matthew of 2016 and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 did.
4330,9,georgia,4330,"Due to anthropogenic climate change, Georgia's climate is warming."
4331,9,georgia,4331,"This situation is already causing major disturbances, for example due to sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable than many other states because its land is sinking) and warming will continue to increase."
4332,9,georgia,4332,"The United States Census Office estimates that in 2019, Georgia had 10,617,423 inhabitants, an increase of 97,948 over the previous year, and an increase of 929,770 (9.60%) since 2010."
4333,9,georgia,4333,"This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438,939 (849,414 births minus 410,475 deaths) and an increase from the net migration of 606,673 persons in the state."
4334,9,georgia,4334,"Immigration has resulted in a net increase of 228,415 people, and internal migration has resulted in a net increase of 378,258 people."
4335,9,georgia,4335,"In 2010, the number of illegal immigrants living in Georgia more than doubled to 480,000 between January 2000 and January 2009, according to a federal report."
4336,9,georgia,4336,This has given Georgia the largest percentage increase among the 10 states with the largest populations of illegal immigrants in those years.

4341,9,georgia,4341,Hispanics and Latinos of all races accounted for 8.8% of the population.
4342,9,georgia,4342,"In 2011, 58.8 per cent of the Georgian population under one year of age were minorities (i.e., they had at least one non-Hispanic white parent) compared to other states such as California with 75.1 per cent, New York with 55.6 per cent and Texas with 69.8 per cent."
4343,9,georgia,4343,The largest groups of European ancestry are:
4344,9,georgia,4344,"At the 1980 census, 1,584,303 Georgians claimed English ancestry out of a total population of 3,994,817, making it 40 per cent of the state and the largest ethnic group at the time."
4345,9,georgia,4345,"Today, many of the same people claiming to be of ""American"" descent are actually English, and some of them are of Scottish origin; however, their families have been living in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify themselves simply as having an ""American"" ancestry or do not actually know their own ancestry."
4346,9,georgia,4346,"Their ancestry dates mainly to the thirteen colonies of origin and, for this reason, many of them today simply claim ""American"" ancestry, although they are mainly of English origin."
4347,9,georgia,4347,"In 2004, 7.7 per cent of the Georgian population were under the age of 5, 26.4 per cent under the age of 18 and 9.6 per cent at least 65 years of age."
4348,9,georgia,4348,"In 2004, women accounted for about 50.6 per cent of the population and African Americans for about 29.6 per cent."
4349,9,georgia,4349,"Historically, about half of the Georgian population was made up of Afro-Americans who, before the civil war, were almost exclusively slaves."
4350,9,georgia,4350,The large migration of hundreds of thousands of black people from rural south to industrial north from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African-American population.
4351,9,georgia,4351,"Georgia experienced the second fastest growth of the Asian population in the United States from 1990 to 2000, more than double its size over the 10-year period."
4352,9,georgia,4352,"In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percentage of the total population of Afro-Americans (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and the third in terms of the digital black population after New York and Florida."
4353,9,georgia,4353,Georgia is the third country with the lowest percentage of older persons (65 years of age or older) at 12.8 per cent (in 2015).
4354,9,georgia,4354,"The colonization of a large number of Scottish, English-American, and Scottish-Irish Americans in the mountains and piedmonts, and coastal colonization by some English-Americans and African-Americans, have strongly influenced the state culture in food, language, and music."
4355,9,georgia,4355,The concentration of Africans imported into coastal areas in the 18th century on several occasions in rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the lower country among African Americans.
4356,9,georgia,4356,"They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture continue more than in other areas."
4357,9,georgia,4357,"In the creolization of the culture of the South, their food routes have become an integral part of all the cuisine of the South in the Lower Country."
4358,9,georgia,4358,"In 2010, 87.35 per cent (7,666,663) of Georgians aged 5 and over spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.42 per cent (651,583) spoke Spanish, 0.51 per cent (44,702) Korean, 0.44 per cent (38,244) Vietnamese, 0.42 per cent (36,679) French, 0.38 per cent (33,009) Chinese (including Mandarin) and German, which was spoken as the main language by 0.29 per cent (23,351) of the population aged over 5."

4360,9,georgia,4360,"Atlanta, located in the north-central part of Georgia east of the continental ditch, has been Georgia's capital since 1868."
4361,9,georgia,4361,"It is the most populated city in Georgia, with an estimated population of just over 506,000 in 2019."
4362,9,georgia,4362,"The metropolitan area of Atlanta is the cultural and economic centre of South East, with an estimated population of over 6 million, or 57% of Georgia's total, in 2019."
4363,9,georgia,4363,Atlanta is the ninth largest metropolitan area in the country.
4364,9,georgia,4364,"The state has 17 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, according to estimates from the 2019 U.S. census."
4365,9,georgia,4365,"Together with the rest of the South-East, the Georgian population continues to grow rapidly, with primary gains concentrated in urban areas."
4366,9,georgia,4366,"The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area increased by 1.23 million people (24%) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta moved from the eleventh largest metropolitan area of the United States to the ninth largest."
4367,9,georgia,4367,"The composition of religious affiliation in Georgia is 70% Protestant, 9% Catholic, 1% Mormon, 1% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist and 0.5% Hindu."
4368,9,georgia,4368,"Atheists, deists, agnostics and other non-affiliated persons account for 13% of the population."
4369,9,georgia,4369,"The largest Christian denominations according to the number of adherents in 2010 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,759,317; the Methodist Church united with 619,394; and the Roman Catholic Church with 596,384."
4370,9,georgia,4370,"The non-denominational evangelical Protestant had 566,782 members; the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) had 175,184 members; and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. had 172,982."
4371,9,georgia,4371,"The Presbyterian Church (USA) is the largest Presbyterian body in the state, with 300 congregations and 100,000 members."
4372,9,georgia,4372,"The other large body, the Presbyterian Church in America, had 14 congregations and 2,800 members at its founding date; by 2010, it had 139 congregations and 32,000 members."
4373,9,georgia,4373,"The Roman Catholic Church is remarkable in the urban areas of Georgia, and includes the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of Savannah."

4376,9,georgia,4376,Chabad and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute are also active in the state.
4377,9,georgia,4377,"Like all other American states and the federal government, the Georgian government is based on the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial branches."
4378,9,georgia,4378,"The executive power of the State belongs to the Governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republic)."
4379,9,georgia,4379,The Governor of Georgia and the Lieutenant Governor are elected by separate ballot for a term of four years.
4380,9,georgia,4380,"Unlike the federal government, but like many other American states, most of the leaders who make up the governor's cabinet are elected by Georgian citizens rather than by the governor."
4381,9,georgia,4381,"Legislative power belongs to the General Assembly, composed of the Senator and the House of Representatives."
4382,9,georgia,4382,"The Lieutenant Governor presides over the senator, while members of the House of Representatives choose their own Speaker."
4383,9,georgia,4383,"The Constitution of Georgia provides for a maximum of 56 senators, elected in the single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives distributed among the representative districts (which sometimes translates into more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives."
4384,9,georgia,4384,The term of office of senators and representatives is two years.
4385,9,georgia,4385,Laws promulgated by the General Assembly are codified in the Annotated Official Code of Georgia.

4392,9,georgia,4392,"Some counties have been nominated for personalities of both American and Georgian history, and many have names of Native American origin."
4393,9,georgia,4393,"The counties of Georgia have their own elected legislative power, usually called the Council of Commissioners, which generally also has executive power in the county."
4394,9,georgia,4394,"Several counties have a single form of Commissioner's government, with legislative and executive powers vested in one person."
4395,9,georgia,4395,Georgia is the only State that currently has counties of Sole Commissioner.
4396,9,georgia,4396,"The Constitution of Georgia confers on all counties and cities the authority of ""domestic domination""."
4397,9,georgia,4397,"County commissions have considerable power to pass laws in their county, as a municipality would."
4398,9,georgia,4398,"Georgia recognizes all local government units as cities, so every incorporated city is legally a city."
4399,9,georgia,4399,"Georgia does not provide for cantons or independent cities, although draft laws have been proposed to the Legislative Assembly to provide for cantons; it allows county governments to be consolidated by local referendum."
4400,9,georgia,4400,"All the second-ranked cities of Georgia, with the exception of Savannah, have now formed by referendum consolidated governments of the Counties: Columbus (in 1970), Athens (1990), Augusta (1995) and Macon (2012)."
4401,9,georgia,4401,(Augusta and Athens excluded one or more small towns within their consolidated borders; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all small entities within their consolidated borders.)
4402,9,georgia,4402,The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated city-county government after merging with Chattahoochee County not incorporated in 2003.
4403,9,georgia,4403,"Three years later, in 2006, Georgetown was consolidated with the rest of Quitman County."
4404,9,georgia,4404,"There is no real metropolitan government in Georgia, although the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and the Georgia Regional Transport Administration provide some services, and the CRA must approve all major land use planning projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area."
4405,9,georgia,4405,"Georgia had voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a series that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020."
4406,9,georgia,4406,"Until 1964, the state government of Georgia had the longest record of domination of a single party by the Democratic Party of any state in the Union."
4407,9,georgia,4407,This record was largely established due to the abandonment of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws at the beginning of the 20th century.
4408,9,georgia,4408,"Some elements, such as the obligation to pay taxes and pass literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering for voting; their exclusion from the political system lasted in the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century."
4409,9,georgia,4409,"The White Democrats regained power after the reconstruction in part thanks to the efforts of some who resort to intimidation and violence, but this method has fallen into disrepute."
4410,9,georgia,4410,"In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a constitutional amendment in 1908, Blacks made up 47 per cent of the population of the state."
4411,9,georgia,4411,"The Whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice deprived the blacks and the poor whites, almost half of the population of the state."
4412,9,georgia,4412,It required that any man at least 21 years of age who wished to register for the vote: (a) be of good moral character and be able to pass a citizenship test; (b) be able to read and write provisions of the constitutions of the United States and Georgia; or (c) possess at least 40 acres of land or $500 of property.
4413,9,georgia,4413,Any Georgian who had fought in any war of the American Revolution during the Spanish-American war was exempt from these additional qualifications.
4414,9,georgia,4414,"Most importantly, any Georgian descendant of a veteran of one of these wars has also been exempted."
4415,9,georgia,4415,"Because in 1908 many white men in Georgia were grandsons of veterans and/or possessed the required property, exemption and property requirement basically allowed only well-made whites to vote."
4416,9,georgia,4416,"Good character qualifications, knowledge of citizenship and literacy (all subjectively determined by white registrars) and property were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering for voting."
4417,9,georgia,4417,The lists of electors have fallen dramatically.
4418,9,georgia,4418,"At the beginning of the 20th century, Progressive encouraged electoral reform and reduced the power of constituency leaders to cleanse politics."
4419,9,georgia,4419,"Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, have continued to effectively shut down illiterate people."
4420,9,georgia,4420,The rule of the single white party has been solidified.
4421,9,georgia,4421,"For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians appointed and elected only white democratic governors, and White Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly."
4422,9,georgia,4422,"Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats, who were financially and socially conservative according to national standards."
4423,9,georgia,4423,This method of voting continued after the period of segregation.
4424,9,georgia,4424,Legal segregation ended with federal legislation in the 1960s.
4425,9,georgia,4425,"According to the 1960 census, the proportion of the population of Georgia that was African-American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of Blacks had left the state in the Great Migration to the North and the Midwest."
4426,9,georgia,4426,New white residents arrived through migration and immigration.
4427,9,georgia,4427,"Following the support of the National Democratic Party for the Civil Rights Movement and in particular for the Civil Rights Law of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia."
4428,9,georgia,4428,"In the decades since the end of the 20th century, conservative white-majority voters have increasingly supported Republicans for national and state offices."
4429,9,georgia,4429,"In 2002, the outgoing moderate democratic governor Roy Barnes was defeated by Republican Sonny Perdue, a state legislator and former democrat."
4430,9,georgia,4430,"While the democrats retained control of the House of State, they lost their majority in the Senate when four democrats changed their party."
4431,9,georgia,4431,They lost the House in the 2004 elections.
4432,9,georgia,4432,The Republicans then controlled the three partisan elements of the state government.
4433,9,georgia,4433,"Even before 2002, the state had become increasingly favourable to Republicans in presidential elections."
4434,9,georgia,4434,She has only supported a democrat three times since 1960.
4435,9,georgia,4435,"In 1976 and 1980, the native son Jimmy Carter carried the state; in 1992, the former governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, won the state."
4436,9,georgia,4436,"In general, Republicans are the strongest in the predominantly white suburbs (especially in the suburbs of Atlanta) and in rural areas of the state."
4437,9,georgia,4437,Many of these regions were represented by Conservative Democrats in the state legislature long before the 21st century.
4438,9,georgia,4438,One of the most conservative of them was the United States.
4439,9,georgia,4439,"MP Larry McDonald, former leader of the John Birch Society, died when the Soviet Union shot KAL 007 near Sakhalin Island."
4440,9,georgia,4440,"Democratic candidates tended to gain a higher percentage of votes in areas with the largest number of black voters, as well as in cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and south-western part of the state."
4441,9,georgia,4441,"The rise of the Republican Party in Georgia and the South in general led to the election of Newt Gingrich, a member of the United States House of Representatives as Speaker of the House following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994."
4442,9,georgia,4442,"Gingrich served as President until 1999, when he resigned as a result of the loss of seats in the Chamber held by members of the GOP."
4443,9,georgia,4443,"Gingrich made a unsuccessful offer for the presidency in the 2012 elections, but withdrew after winning only the primarys of South Carolina and Georgia."

4647,10,hawaii,4647,"Hawaii covers almost the entire Hawaiian archipelago, consisting of 137 volcanic islands extending over 3,400 km, which are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania."
4648,10,hawaii,4648,"The state's ocean coastline is therefore the fourth longest in the United States, about 1,210 km away."
4649,10,hawaii,4649,"The eight main islands, from the north-west to the south-east, are Niyhau, Kauayi, Oyahu, Molokayi, Lānayi, Kahoyolawe, Maui and Hawaii, hence the name of the State, often called ""Big Island"" or ""Hawai Island"" to avoid confusion with the State or Archipelago."

4687,10,hawaii,4687,Kayula is a small island near Niyhau.
4688,10,hawaii,4688,"The Northwest Hawaiian Islands are a group of nine smaller, older islands north-west of Kaua-I that extend from Nihoa to the Kure Atoll; they are vestiges of once much larger volcanic mountains."
4689,10,hawaii,4689,"Across the archipelago there are about 130 small rocks and islets, such as Molokini, which are of volcanic, marine sedimentary or erosional origin."
4690,10,hawaii,4690,"The highest mountain of Hawaii, Mauna Kea, is 4,205 metres above the average sea level; it is higher than Everest if measured from the base of the mountain, which is on the floor of the Pacific Ocean and rises approximately 33,500 feet (10,200 metres)."
4691,10,hawaii,4691,The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an underwater magma source called the Hawaii Hotspot.
4692,10,hawaii,4692,"The process continues to build islands; the tectonic plate under much of the Pacific Ocean moves continuously to the northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes."
4693,10,hawaii,4693,"Due to the location of the hotspot, all currently active terrestrial volcanoes are located on the southern half of Hawaii Island."
4694,10,hawaii,4694,"The most recent volcano, the Lōahi Seamount, is located south of the coast of Hawaii Island."
4695,10,hawaii,4695,"The last volcanic eruption outside Hawaii Island occurred in Haleakalā on Maui before the end of the 18th century, perhaps hundreds of years earlier."
4696,10,hawaii,4696,"In 1790, Kīlauea exploded; it was the most deadly eruption known to have occurred in modern times in what is now the United States."
4697,10,hawaii,4697,"Up to 5,405 warriors and their families walking on Kīlauea were killed by the eruption."
4698,10,hawaii,4698,Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion created impressive geological characteristics.
4699,10,hawaii,4699,Hawaii is the second largest island in the world.
4700,10,hawaii,4700,"On the sides of volcanoes, slope instability caused damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis, particularly in 1868 and 1975."
4701,10,hawaii,4701,Deep cliffs were created by catastrophic debris avalanches on the submerged sides of volcanoes in the ocean islands.
4702,10,hawaii,4702,"The Kīlauea broke out in May 2018, opening 22 crack vents on its eastern Rift area."
4703,10,hawaii,4703,Leilani properties and Lanipuna gardens are located in this territory.
4704,10,hawaii,4704,"The destruction affected at least 36 buildings, which, together with lava flows and sulphur dioxide fumes, resulted in the evacuation of more than 2,000 residents from the neighbourhoods."
4705,10,hawaii,4705,"As the Hawaiian Islands are far from other terrestrial habitats, it is believed that life has reached them by the wind, waves (i.e."
4706,10,hawaii,4706,by ocean currents) and wings (i.e.
4707,10,hawaii,4707,"birds, insects and seeds that they may have worn on their feathers)."
4708,10,hawaii,4708,"This isolation, combined with the diversity of the environment (including extreme altitudes, tropical climates and dry shores), has allowed the evolution of new endemic flora and fauna."
4709,10,hawaii,4709,Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state.
4710,10,hawaii,4710,"An endemic plant, Brighamia, now requires hand pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed extinct."
4711,10,hawaii,4711,Both species of Brighamia-B.
4712,10,hawaii,4712,rockii and B. insignis are represented in nature by approximately 120 individual plants.
4713,10,hawaii,4713,"To ensure that these plants deposit seeds, biologists push 910-metre cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas."
4714,10,hawaii,4714,The archipelago's main existing islands have been above the ocean's surface for less than 10 million years.
4715,10,hawaii,4715,The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on the high mountains within a trade field.
4716,10,hawaii,4716,"On a single island, the climate around the coast can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimetres of annual precipitation) to wet tropical; on the slopes, the environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres per year), to temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold and dry climate."
4717,10,hawaii,4717,"Rainy climate has implications for soil development, which largely determines soil permeability, affecting stream and wetland distribution."
4718,10,hawaii,4718,Several areas of Hawaii are protected by the National Parks Service.
4719,10,hawaii,4719,"Hawaii has two national parks: Haleakalā National Park located near Kula on Maui Island, which houses the Haleakalā Dormant Volcano that formed Maui East, and Hawaii Volcano National Park in the south-eastern region of Hawaii Island, which includes the active volcano Kīlauea and its discord areas."
4720,10,hawaii,4720,"There are three national historic parks: Kalaupa National Historic Park in Kalaupa, Molokai, the site of a former leper colony; Kaloko-Honokau National Historic Park in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii Island; and Pu-uhonua o Hōnaunau National Historic Park, a former refuge on the west coast of Hawaii Island."
4721,10,hawaii,4721,Other areas under the control of the National Parks Service include the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on Hawaii Island and the USARIZona Memorial at Pearl Harbor on O.A.hu Island.
4722,10,hawaii,4722,The Papahānaumokuākea Navy National Monument was proclaimed by President George W. Bush on 15 June 2006.
4723,10,hawaii,4723,"The monument covers approximately 140,000 square kilometres (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls and shallow deep waters up to 80 kilometres off the Pacific Ocean, a larger area than all United States national parks combined."
4724,10,hawaii,4724,"The Hawaiian climate is typical of the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme due to the almost constant trade winds of the east."
4725,10,hawaii,4725,"Summer levels generally reach about 88°F (31°C) during the day, with a low temperature of 75°F (24°C) at night."
4726,10,hawaii,4726,Winter day temperatures are usually around 83°F (28°C)
4727,10,hawaii,4727,"Snow, which is generally not associated with the tropics, falls to 13,800 feet (4,200 m) on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on Hawaii Island in a few months of winter."
4728,10,hawaii,4728,Snow rarely falls on Haleakalā.
4729,10,hawaii,4729,"Mount Wai=ale=ale on Kaua=i has the second highest annual average precipitation on Earth, about 460 inches (12,000 mm) per year."
4730,10,hawaii,4730,Most Hawaiians live only two seasons
4731,10,hawaii,4731,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state at Pahala on April 27, 1931, is 100°F (38°C), making it bound to Alaska as the lowest record temperature observed in the U.S. state."
4732,10,hawaii,4732,The record low temperature of Hawaii is 12°F (−11°C) observed in May 1979 on the summit of Mauna Kea.
4733,10,hawaii,4733,Hawaii is the only state that has never recorded any Fahrenheit subzero temperatures.
4734,10,hawaii,4734,"Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into wind and leeward zones (ko-olau and kona, respectively) depending on location relative to the upper mountains."
4735,10,hawaii,4735,The sides wind face to cloudy cover.
4736,10,hawaii,4736,Hawaii is one of two states that were widely recognized independent nations before joining the United States.
4737,10,hawaii,4737,"The Kingdom of Hawaii was sovereign from 1810 until 1893, when the monarchy was overthrown by American and European resident capitalists and landowners."
4738,10,hawaii,4738,"Hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until August 12, 1898, when it officially became the territory of the United States."
4739,10,hawaii,4739,"Hawaii was admitted as an American state on August 21, 1959."
4740,10,hawaii,4740,"Archaeological data indicate that the first habitation in the Hawaiian Islands dates back to about 300 AD, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands."
4741,10,hawaii,4741,A second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora took place in the 11th century.
4742,10,hawaii,4742,The date of the human discovery and housing of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of an academic debate.
4743,10,hawaii,4743,"Some archaeologists and historians believe that it was a subsequent wave of immigrants from Tahiti around the year 1000 that introduced a new line of high leaders, the kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the construction of heiau."
4744,10,hawaii,4744,This subsequent immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (mo-olelo) about Pa-ao.
4745,10,hawaii,4745,Other authors argue that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence of a subsequent influx of Tahitian settlers and that Paao should be considered a myth.
4746,10,hawaii,4746,"The history of the islands is marked by slow and steady population growth and the size of the capitals, which has grown to encompass entire islands."
4747,10,hawaii,4747,"The local leaders, called alii, ruled their colonies and waged wars to expand their influence and defend their communities against predatory rivals."
4748,10,hawaii,4748,"The ancient Hawaii was a caste-based society, much like the Hindu society in India."
4749,10,hawaii,4749,"The arrival in 1778 of the British explorer, Captain James Cook, marked the first documented contact of a European explorer with Hawaii."
4750,10,hawaii,4750,"Cook named the archipelago ""Sandwich Islands"" in honour of his godfather John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the location of the islands and making the native name Owyhee."
4751,10,hawaii,4751,"The form ""Owyhee"" or ""Owhyhee"" is preserved on behalf of certain parts of the Northwestern Pacific United States, including Owyhee County and the Owyhee Mountains in Idaho, named after three Hawaiian Aboriginal members of a trapping party that has disappeared in the area."
4752,10,hawaii,4752,"It is very possible that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century, two hundred years before Cook's first documented visit in 1778."
4753,10,hawaii,4753,"Ruy López de Villalobos ordered a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 to the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano on board as a pilot."
4754,10,hawaii,4754,"According to the interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe a meeting with the Hawaiians or the Marshall Islands."
4755,10,hawaii,4755,"If the crew of Villalobos spotted Hawaii, Gaetano would therefore be considered the first European to see the islands."
4756,10,hawaii,4756,Some researchers have rejected these allegations because of a lack of credibility.
4757,10,hawaii,4757,"Nevertheless, the Spanish archives contain a map that represents the islands at the same latitude as Hawaii, but with a longitude of ten degrees east of the islands."
4758,10,hawaii,4758,"In this manuscript, Maui Island is called La Desgraciada (the unfortunate island), and what appears to be Hawaii Island is called La Mesa (the Table)."
4759,10,hawaii,4759,"The islands resembling Kaho-olawe, Lāna-i and Moloka-i are named Los Monjes (the Monks)."
4760,10,hawaii,4760,"For two and a half centuries, Spanish galions crossed the Pacific from Mexico by a road that crossed the south of Hawaii towards Manila."
4761,10,hawaii,4761,The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish commercial monopoly from competing powers.
4762,10,hawaii,4762,"Hawaii thus maintained its independence, although it was located on an east-west maritime route between the nations that were subjects of the Vice-royalty of New Spain, an empire that exercised jurisdiction over many civilizations and subject kingdoms on both sides of the Pacific."
4763,10,hawaii,4763,"Despite these disputed claims, Cook is generally considered the first European to land in Hawaii, having visited the Hawaiian Islands twice."
4764,10,hawaii,4764,"As he was preparing for the start after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as Cook took idols from the temple and fences as ""wood of fire,"" and a minor chief and his men stole a boat from his ship."
4765,10,hawaii,4765,"Cook abducted the King of Hawaii Island, Kalaniōpuyu, and held him for ransom on board his ship in order to obtain the return of Cook's boat, as this tactic had previously worked in Tahiti and other islands."
4766,10,hawaii,4766,"Instead, Kalaniōpusu's supporters attacked, killing Cook and four sailors as Cook's party withdrew along the beach to their ship."
4767,10,hawaii,4767,The ship left without recovering the stolen boat.
4768,10,hawaii,4768,"After Cook's visit and the publication of several books on his travels, the Hawaiian islands attracted many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers, who found the islands as a convenient port and source of supplies."
4769,10,hawaii,4769,"One can see the influence of the early British in the design of the Hawaii flag, which carries the Union Jack in the upper left corner."
4770,10,hawaii,4770,"These visitors introduced diseases into the islands that were once isolated, causing a rapid fall in the Hawaiian population."
4771,10,hawaii,4771,"Native Hawaiians have no resistance to Eurasian diseases such as influenza, smallpox and measles."
4772,10,hawaii,4772,"In 1820, disease, famine and wars between the chiefs killed more than half of the Hawaiian indigenous population."
4773,10,hawaii,4773,Measles killed one fifth of Hawaiians in the 1850s.
4774,10,hawaii,4774,"Historical records indicate that the first Chinese immigrants to Hawaii came from Guangdong province; some sailors arrived in 1778 with Captain Cook's trip, and others arrived in 1789 with an American merchant who settled in Hawaii in the late eighteenth century."
4775,10,hawaii,4775,"It is said that leprosy was introduced by Chinese workers in 1830, and as with other new infectious diseases, it proved to be harmful to Hawaiians."
4776,10,hawaii,4776,"In the 1780s and 1790s, leaders often fought for power."

5183,10,hawaii,5183,"In general, they focus on self-determination and autonomy, either for Hawaii as an independent nation (in many proposals, for ""Hawai nationals"" who are descended or declared to be such by choice from subjects of the Hawaiian Kingdom), or for persons of full or partial Hawaiian ancestry in an indigenous ""nation-to-nation"" relationship similar to tribal sovereignty with the American federal recognition of indigenous Hawaiians."

5193,11,idaho,5193,"With a population of about 1.7 million and an area of 33,570 square miles (216,400 km2), Idaho is the 14th largest, the 12th least populated and the 7th least dense of the 50 American states."
5194,11,idaho,5194,The capital of the state and the largest city is Boise.
5195,11,idaho,5195,"For thousands of years, Idaho has been inhabited by Amerindian peoples."
5196,11,idaho,5196,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Idaho was considered to be part of Oregon, a disputed area between the United States and the British Empire."
5197,11,idaho,5197,"It officially became American territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho territory was only organized in 1863, instead of being included for periods in the Oregon Territory and the Washington Territory."
5198,11,idaho,5198,"Idaho was finally admitted to the Union on 3 July 1890, becoming the 43rd state."
5199,11,idaho,5199,"As part of the Pacific Northwest (and the associated Cascadia bioregion), Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions."
5200,11,idaho,5200,"The northern state, the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle, is closely linked to the eastern state of Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone – the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone."

5202,11,idaho,5202,The southeastern part of the state includes part of the Great Basin.

5206,11,idaho,5206,"A number of scientific and technological enterprises have their headquarters in Idaho or factories there, and the State also contains the National Laboratory of Idaho, which is the country's largest energy department."
5207,11,idaho,5207,"The agricultural sector in Idaho provides many products, but the state is best known for its potato cultivation, which accounts for about a third of the national yield."
5208,11,idaho,5208,"The official nickname of the state is ""the State of Gem"", which refers to the natural beauty of Idaho."
5209,11,idaho,5209,The origin of the name remains a mystery.
5210,11,idaho,5210,"In the early 1860s, when the U.S. Congress envisaged organizing a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, the name ""Idaho"" was suggested by George M. Willing, a politician who presented himself as an unrecognized delegate of the unofficial Jefferson territory."
5211,11,idaho,5211,"Willing claimed that the name was derived from a term Shoshone meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""the name of the mountains"", but it was later revealed that there was no such term and Willing claimed that he was inspired to give the name when he met a little girl named ""Ida""."
5212,11,idaho,5212,"As the name seemed to be made, the U.S. Congress finally decided to appoint the Colorado Territory region instead when it was created in February 1861, but by the time that decision was made, the city of Idaho Springs, Colorado had already been named according to Willing's proposal."
5213,11,idaho,5213,"That same year, Congress established Colorado Territory, a county called Idaho County, which was established in eastern Washington."
5214,11,idaho,5214,"The county was named after a steamship named Idaho, which was launched on the Columbia River in 1860."
5215,11,idaho,5215,It is not clear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was revealed.
5216,11,idaho,5216,"In any event, part of Washington's territory, including Idaho County, was used to create Idaho's territory in 1863."
5217,11,idaho,5217,"Finally, the name was given to the territory of Idaho, which later became the American state."
5218,11,idaho,5218,"Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well in the 20th century repeated as Willing's account the name ""Idaho"" derived from the term Shoshone ""ee-da-how""."
5219,11,idaho,5219,A 1956 Idaho history manual says:
5220,11,idaho,5220,"Another etymology attributes the name to the word Apache of the Plains ""ídaahęęę"" IPA: [í.ta.h.H.H.] (enemy) which was used in reference to the Comanche."
5221,11,idaho,5221,Idaho borders six U.S. states and one Canadian province.

5231,11,idaho,5231,"The Snake River flows from Yellowstone in northwestern Wyoming across the Snake River plain in southern Idaho before turning north, leaving the state at Lewiston before joining the Columbia at Kennewick."
5232,11,idaho,5232,"Other important rivers are the Clark Fork/Pend Oreille River, the Spokane River and the main tributaries of the Snake River, including the Clearwater River, the Salmon River, the Boise River and the Payette River."
5233,11,idaho,5233,"The Salmon River flows into the Snake River in the Hells Canyon and forms the southern boundary of Nez Perce County on its north shore, of which Lewiston is the county seat."

5236,11,idaho,5236,"The valley contains the main cities of Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Caldwell, Twin Falls, Idaho Falls and Pocatello."
5237,11,idaho,5237,"The plain served as an easy passage through the Rocky Mountains for settlers westward on the Oregon Trail, and many settlers chose to settle in the area rather than risk the perfidious road through the Blue Mountains and the Cascade Range to the west."
5238,11,idaho,5238,"The western region of the plain is known as the Trésor Valley, linked between the Owyhee Mountains in the southwest and the Boise Mountains in the northeast."

5250,11,idaho,5250,The climate of Idaho varies considerably.
5251,11,idaho,5251,"Although the western border of the state is about 350 miles (560 km) from the Pacific Ocean, maritime influence is still felt in Idaho, especially in winter when cloud cover, humidity and precipitation are at their peak."
5252,11,idaho,5252,"This influence has a moderate effect in winter, where temperatures are not as low as might be expected for a northern state where altitudes are primarily high."
5253,11,idaho,5253,"Maritime influence is less pronounced in the eastern part of the state where precipitation is often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid continental climate."
5254,11,idaho,5254,"Idaho may be warm, although prolonged periods of more than 98°F (37°C) are rare, with the exception of the lowest point of altitude, Lewiston, who sees little snow as a result."
5255,11,idaho,5255,"The warm summer days are tempered by low relative humidity and cooler evenings during the summer months, since for most states, the greatest diurnal difference in temperature is often in summer."
5256,11,idaho,5256,"Winters can be cold, although long periods of bitter cold below zero are unusual."
5257,11,idaho,5257,"The highest temperature of Idaho at 118°F (48°C) was recorded at Orofino on July 28, 1934; the lowest temperature of Idaho at -60°F (−51°C) was recorded at Island Park Dam on January 18, 1943."

5261,11,idaho,5261,A late upper paleolithic site was identified at Cooper's Ferry in western Idaho near Cottonwood by archaeologists in 2019.
5262,11,idaho,5262,"According to the evidence found at the site, the first people lived in this area 15,300 to 16,600 years ago, before the Beringia Land Bridge of about 1,000 years old."
5263,11,idaho,5263,"The discoverers, Professor of Anthropology Loren Davis and his colleagues, pointed out that they have similarities with the tools and artifacts discovered in Japan 16,000 to 13,000 years ago."
5264,11,idaho,5264,"The discovery also showed that the first peoples may not have come to North America by land, as has already been said."
5265,11,idaho,5265,"On the contrary, they probably crossed the water on a Pacific coastal route."
5266,11,idaho,5266,"An early presence of French Canadian trappers is visible in names and names: Nose Percé, Coeur d'Alène, Boisé, Payette, some pre-existing expeditions of Lewis and Clark and Astorien, who themselves included a large number of French and Métis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain."
5267,11,idaho,5267,"The Idaho, part of Oregon, was claimed by the United States and Great Britain until the United States acquired an undisputed jurisdiction in 1846."
5268,11,idaho,5268,"From 1843 to 1849, Idaho was currently under the de facto jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon."
5269,11,idaho,5269,"When Oregon became a state, what is now Idaho was in what remained of the original Oregon territory not part of the new state, and designated as Washington territory."
5270,11,idaho,5270,"Between that date and the creation of the Idaho territory on March 4, 1863, at Lewiston, parts of the present state were included in the territories of Oregon, Washington and Dakota."
5271,11,idaho,5271,"The new territory included today's Idaho, Montana and most Wyoming."
5272,11,idaho,5272,"The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed the Idaho in 1805 on the Pacific Road and in 1806 on the return, largely following the two directions of the Clearwater River."
5273,11,idaho,5273,"The first non-Aboriginal colony was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Pend Oreille Lake for the fur trade in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company."
5274,11,idaho,5274,"In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near Lewiston today."
5275,11,idaho,5275,"This position, called ""MacKenzie's Post"" or ""Clearwater"", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was purchased by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned."
5276,11,idaho,5276,"The first attempts by organized communities, within the current Idaho borders, were launched in 1860."
5277,11,idaho,5277,The first permanent and important community was Lewiston in 1861.
5278,11,idaho,5278,"After a few tribulations as a territory, including the chaotic transfer from the territorial capital of Lewiston to Boise, the abandonment of the right to vote of the Mormonist polygamists supported by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, and a federal attempt to divide the territory between the territory of Washington which obtained state status in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho obtained state status in 1890."
5279,11,idaho,5279,Idaho was one of the hardest hit by the Pacific Northwest States during the Great Depression.
5280,11,idaho,5280,"Prices fell for the main Idaho crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes earned only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income fall from $686 in 1929 to $250 in 1932."
5281,11,idaho,5281,"In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a state of tourism and agriculture to include science and technology industries."
5282,11,idaho,5282,"Science and technology have become the largest economic centre in the state (over 25 per cent of total government revenues) and are more important than agriculture, forestry and mining combined."
5283,11,idaho,5283,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the Idaho population was 1,787,065 on July 1, 2018, an increase of 14% since 2010."
5284,11,idaho,5284,"Idaho had an estimated population of 1,754,208 in 2018, an increase of 37,265 over the previous year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91 per cent, since 2010."
5285,11,idaho,5285,"This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to the net migration of 75,795 people to the State."
5286,11,idaho,5286,There are a large number of Americans of English and German origin in Idaho.
5287,11,idaho,5287,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and internal migration resulted in a net increase of 61,273 people."

5348,11,idaho,5348,"In 2017, Idaho's primary energy source was hydropower, and energy companies had a total retail sales of 23,793,790 megawatt hours (MWh)."
5349,11,idaho,5349,"In 2017, Idaho had a regulated electricity market, with the Idaho Public Services Commission regulating the three main utilities of Avista Utilities, Idaho Power and Rocky Mountain Power."
5350,11,idaho,5350,Idaho's energy landscape supports the development of renewable energy systems.
5351,11,idaho,5351,"The state is rich in renewable energy resources, but its fossil fuel resources are limited."
5352,11,idaho,5352,The Snake River Plain and smaller river basins provide Idaho with some of the country's best hydroelectric resources and geologically active mountain areas have significant geothermal power and wind power potential.
5353,11,idaho,5353,These realities have shaped much of the state's energy landscape.
5354,11,idaho,5354,Idaho imports most of the energy it consumes.
5355,11,idaho,5355,"Imports account for more than 80% of energy consumption, including the total supply of natural gas and oil to Idaho and more than half of its electricity."
5356,11,idaho,5356,"In 2005, 48% of the electricity consumed in Idaho came from hydropower, 42% from coal combustion and 9% from natural gas combustion."
5357,11,idaho,5357,The rest comes from other renewable sources such as wind.
5358,11,idaho,5358,"The State's numerous river basins allow hydropower plants to supply 556,000 MWh, representing about three-quarters of the electricity generated by Idaho in the state."
5359,11,idaho,5359,The state of Washington supplies most of the natural gas used in Idaho through one of the two main pipeline networks that supply the state.
5360,11,idaho,5360,"Although the State relies on sources outside the State for its total supply of natural gas, it uses natural gas-fired facilities to produce 127 000 MWh, or about 10 per cent of its production."
5361,11,idaho,5361,Coal production and the small grid of state wind turbines feed the rest of the state's electricity generation.
5362,11,idaho,5362,"The state produces 739 000 MWh, but still has to import half of its electricity from outside to meet demand."
5363,11,idaho,5363,"While Idaho's 515 trillion British thermal units (151 TWh) are small compared to other states and account for only 0.5% of U.S. consumption, the state also has the country's 11th smallest population, 1.5 million people, so its per capita energy consumption of BTU 352 million (103 MWh) is just above the national average of BTU 333 million (98 MWh)."
5364,11,idaho,5364,"As the 13th state in terms of the area of 83,570 square miles (53,480,000 acres; 216,400 km2), the distance creates the additional problem of the ""line loss""."
5365,11,idaho,5365,"When the length of an electric transmission line is doubled, the resistance to an electric current passing through it is also doubled."
5366,11,idaho,5366,"In addition, Idaho also has the 6th fastest growing population in the United States, and the population is expected to increase by 31 per cent between 2008 and 2030."
5367,11,idaho,5367,"This projected increase in population will contribute to a 42% increase in demand by 2030, which will further increase Idaho's limited hydroelectric resources."
5368,11,idaho,5368,"Idaho has a higher estimate of the development potential to generate 44,320 GWh/year from 18,076 MW of wind energy, and 7,467,000 GWh/year from solar energy using 2,061,000 MW of photovoltaics (PV), including 3,224 MW of photovoltaics on roofs, and 1,267,000 MW of concentrated solar energy."
5369,11,idaho,5369,"The Idaho Ministry of Transport is the government agency responsible for Idaho's transportation infrastructure, including operation and maintenance and planning for future needs."
5370,11,idaho,5370,"The agency is also responsible for overseeing the delivery of federal, state and government transportation program grants."
5371,11,idaho,5371,"Idaho is one of the few states of the nation without a major highway linking its two largest metropolitan areas, Boise in the south and Coeur d'Alene in the north."
5372,11,idaho,5372,"The United States-95 connects the two ends of the state, but like many other highways in Idaho, it is in dire need of repairs and improvements."
5373,11,idaho,5373,"In 2007, the Idaho Department of Transport reported that the Government's road infrastructure was facing an annual deficit of $200 million in maintenance and improvement."
5374,11,idaho,5374,"I-84 is the main road connecting the south-east and south-west parts of the state, with I-86 and I-15."
5375,11,idaho,5375,Major Federal Aid Routes in Idaho:
5376,11,idaho,5376,"Major airports include the Boise International Airport serving the southwestern Idaho region and the Spokane International Airport (in Spokane, Washington) serving northern Idaho."
5377,11,idaho,5377,Other scheduled airports include Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport serving the Palouse; Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and the north and west centre of Idaho; Magic Valley Regional Airport at Twin Falls; Idaho Falls Regional Airport; and Pocatello Regional Airport.
5378,11,idaho,5378,The Idaho is served by three transcontinental railways.
5379,11,idaho,5379,"The Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) connects the Idaho Panhandle with Seattle, Portland and Spokane to the west, and Minneapolis and Chicago to the east."
5380,11,idaho,5380,"The BNSF crosses the counties of Kootenai, Bonner and Boundary."
5381,11,idaho,5381,"The Union Pacific railway crosses the North Idaho by entering Canada via Boundary and Bonner, and by way of Spokane."
5382,11,idaho,5382,"Canadian Pacific Railway uses the Union Pacific Railroad tracks in Northern Idaho carrying products from Alberta to Spokane and Portland, Oregon."
5383,11,idaho,5383,"Amtrak's Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop at Sandpoint."
5384,11,idaho,5384,"Montana Rail Link also operates between Billings, Montana and Sandpoint, Idaho"
5385,11,idaho,5385,"The Union Pacific railway also crosses southern Idaho between Portland, Oregon, Green River, Wyoming and Ogden, Utah and serves Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls and Pocatello."
5386,11,idaho,5386,Lewiston Harbour is the furthest inland port in the Pacific on the west coast.
5387,11,idaho,5387,"A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and Columbia River facilitate the movement of barges from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded onto ocean vessels."
5388,11,idaho,5388,The constitution of Idaho is roughly shaped on the national constitution with several additions.
5389,11,idaho,5389,The Constitution defines the form and functions of the State government and may be amended by plebiscite.
5390,11,idaho,5390,"In particular, the constitution of the State currently requires that the Government of the State maintain a balanced budget."
5391,11,idaho,5391,"As a result, Idaho has a limited debt (construction bonds, etc.)."

5393,11,idaho,5393,All Idaho laws are contained in the Idaho Code and Statute.
5394,11,idaho,5394,The Code is amended by the Legislative Assembly with the approval of the Governor.
5395,11,idaho,5395,The Idaho still operates under its original constitution (1889).
5396,11,idaho,5396,"The constitution of Idaho provides for three powers of government: executive, legislative and judicial."
5397,11,idaho,5397,"The Idaho has a bicameral legislature, elected in 35 legislative districts, each represented by one senator and two representatives."
5398,11,idaho,5398,"Since 1946, the elected members of the State as a whole have been elected for a four-year term."
5399,11,idaho,5399,"These include the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of State of Idaho (prior to 1994), the Treasurer, the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Instruction."
5400,11,idaho,5400,"Recently challenged in 1966, the Inspector of Mines was a constitutional office originally elected."
5401,11,idaho,5401,"Subsequently, it was an appointed position and finally completely abolished in 1974."
5402,11,idaho,5402,The Idaho government has a monopoly on alcohol.
5403,11,idaho,5403,The Governor of Idaho has a four-year term and is elected in so-called national mid-term elections.
5404,11,idaho,5404,"As such, the Governor is not elected in the same election year as the President of the United States."
5405,11,idaho,5405,"The current governor is Republican Brad Little, who was elected in 2018."
5406,11,idaho,5406,The Idaho legislature is part-time.
5407,11,idaho,5407,"However, the session can be extended if necessary, and it is often extended."
5408,11,idaho,5408,"As a result, the legislators of Idaho are considered ""citizen legislators"", which means that their position as legislator is not their main profession."
5409,11,idaho,5409,The terms of office of the Senator and the House of Representatives are two years.
5410,11,idaho,5410,The parliamentary elections are held every single year.
5411,11,idaho,5411,"The legislative power of Idaho has been continuously controlled by the Republican Party since the late 1950s, although democratic legislators are systematically elected in Boise, Pocatello, Blaine County and in the north of Panhandle."
5412,11,idaho,5412,The highest court in Idaho is the Supreme Court of Idaho.
5413,11,idaho,5413,"There is also an intermediate court of appeal, the Idaho Court of Appeal, which hears cases referred to it by the Supreme Court."
5414,11,idaho,5414,The State District Courts serve seven judicial districts.
5415,11,idaho,5415,Idaho is divided into political jurisdictions designated as counties.
5416,11,idaho,5416,"Since 1919, there have been 44 counties in the state, ranging in size from 410 to 8,502 square miles (1,060 to 22,020 km2)."
5417,11,idaho,5417,Three counties were first designated as such by the Washington Territorial Assembly in 1861.
5418,11,idaho,5418,"Nez Percé County of 1861 has since been divided into counties of Nez Percé, Lewis, Boundary, Benewah, Latah, Kootenai and Clearwater."
5419,11,idaho,5419,The Idaho license plates begin with a county designation based on the first letter of the county name.
5420,11,idaho,5420,"When a letter is at the beginning of more than one name, a number is preceded in alphabetical order."
5421,11,idaho,5421,"This reflects an abnormal situation coinciding with 10 counties starting with B, 7 with C and 4 with L, or 21 out of 44 counties."
5422,11,idaho,5422,"After the civil war, many democrats from the Midwestern and Southern regions settled in Idaho territory."
5423,11,idaho,5423,"As a result, the first territorial legislatures were firmly controlled by the Democrats."
5424,11,idaho,5424,"On the other hand, most territorial governors were appointed by Republican presidents and were Republicans."
5425,11,idaho,5425,"This led to sometimes bitter clashes between the two parties, including a war of scope with the Democrats supporting the shepherds and the Republicans the breeders, which ended in the trial for murder ""Diamondfield"" Jack Davis."
5426,11,idaho,5426,"In the 1880s, Republicans became more important in local politics."
5427,11,idaho,5427,In 1864 Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and state constitution from a locked safe and took them to Boise.
5428,11,idaho,5428,"This actually moved the capital from where it was stored (Lewiston, Idaho) to the current capital Boise."
5429,11,idaho,5429,"Since the creation of the state, the Republican Party has generally been the dominant party of Idaho."
5430,11,idaho,5430,"At one point, the Idaho had two democratic parties, one being the general public and the other called the anti-Marmon Democrats, which lasted at the beginning of the 20th century."
5431,11,idaho,5431,"In the 1890s and early 1900s, the populist party enjoyed importance while the Democratic Party retained a brief domination in the 1930s during the Great Depression."
5432,11,idaho,5432,"Since the Second World War, most of the state-wide elected representatives are Republicans, although the Democrats were the majority in the House (by one seat) in 1958 and in the post of Governor from 1971 to 1995."
5433,11,idaho,5433,The delegations of the Idaho Congress have also been generally Republican since the establishment of the State.
5434,11,idaho,5434,"Several Idaho Democrats have been successful in the House over the years, but the Senators' delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades."
5435,11,idaho,5435,"Several Idaho Republicans, including the current Senator Mike Crapo, won the re-election in the Senate, but only the Frank Church won the re-election as a Democrat."
5436,11,idaho,5436,Church was the last Idaho Democrat to win an American Senators race in 1974.
5437,11,idaho,5437,Walt Minnick's 2008 victory in the first district of Congress was the first victory of the State Democratic Congress in 16 years.
5438,11,idaho,5438,"In modern times, Idaho has been a reliable republican state in presidential politics."
5439,11,idaho,5439,He hasn't supported a democrat for the president since 1964.
5440,11,idaho,5440,"Even in this election, Lyndon Johnson beat Barry Goldwater in the state by less than two percentage points, compared to a landslide at the national level."
5441,11,idaho,5441,"In 2004, Republican George W. Bush carried the Idaho with a 38 percentage point margin and 68.4% of the vote, winning in 43 of the 44 counties."
5442,11,idaho,5442,"Only Blaine County, home to the Sun Valley ski resort, supported John Kerry, who owns a home in the area."
5443,11,idaho,5443,"In 2008, the 36.1 per cent of Obama de Barack was the best candidate for democratic presidential office in Idaho since 1976."
5444,11,idaho,5444,"However, the Republican margins were narrower in 1992 and 1976."
5445,11,idaho,5445,"In the 2006 elections, the Republicans, led by the candidate of the CL government ""Butch"" Otter, won all the constitutional positions of the state and retained the two seats of the state in the United States House of Representatives."
5446,11,idaho,5446,"However, the Democrats obtained several seats in the Legislative Assembly of Idaho, particularly in the Boise region."

6339,13,indiana,6339,Indiana has had a great sporting success at the college level.
6340,13,indiana,6340,"In men's basketball, Indiana Hoosiers won five NCAA National Championships and 22 Big Ten Conference Championships."

6346,13,indiana,6346,"In 2017, Indiana had a civilian workforce of nearly 3.4 million, the 15th largest in the U.S. Indiana has an unemployment rate of 3.4 per cent, below the national average."
6347,13,indiana,6347,Total gross domestic product in 2016 was $347.2 billion.
6348,13,indiana,6348,A high percentage of Indiana's income comes from manufacturing.
6349,13,indiana,6349,"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 17 per cent of the non-agricultural labour force in the state is employed in manufacturing, the highest of all states in the United States."
6350,13,indiana,6350,"The government's top five exports were motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, optical and medical equipment and electrical machinery."
6351,13,indiana,6351,"Despite its dependence on manufacturing, Indiana has been less affected by the decline in traditional Rust Belt manufacturing than many of its neighbours."
6352,13,indiana,6352,The explanation seems to be some of the factors in the labour market.
6353,13,indiana,6353,"First, a large part of heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires a highly skilled workforce, and companies are often willing to find where skills that are difficult to train already exist."
6354,13,indiana,6354,"Second, Indiana's labour force is found mainly in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises."
6355,13,indiana,6355,This allows companies to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than they would normally be.
6356,13,indiana,6356,Companies often see Indiana as a chance to get above-average skills at below-average wages.
6357,13,indiana,6357,"In 2016, Indiana had seven Fortune 500 companies with a total turnover of $142.5 billion."

6363,13,indiana,6363,The State has a feedlot-type system that allows maize to be raised to pigs and fattened cattle.
6364,13,indiana,6364,"With corn, soybeans are also an important commercial crop."
6365,13,indiana,6365,"Its proximity to major urban centres, such as Indianapolis and Chicago, provides dairy production, egg production and specialized horticulture.Other crops include melons, tomatoes, grapes, mint, popcorn and tobacco in southern counties."
6366,13,indiana,6366,Most of the original lands were not grasslands and had to be deforested from deciduous trees.

6369,13,indiana,6369,The tax is collected by the Indiana Revenue Department.
6370,13,indiana,6370,Indiana has a flat-rate income tax rate of 3.23%.
6371,13,indiana,6371,Many state counties also collect income tax.
6372,13,indiana,6372,"The government sales tax rate is 7% with exemptions for food, prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs."
6373,13,indiana,6373,"In some jurisdictions, an additional food and beverage tax is imposed, at a rate of 1% (the Marion County rate is 2%), on sales of prepared meals and beverages."
6374,13,indiana,6374,Property taxes are levied on Indiana's real and personal property and are administered by the Ministry of Finance of Local Government.
6375,13,indiana,6375,"Property is subject to taxation by various taxing units (schools, counties, townships, municipalities and libraries), making the total tax rate the sum of tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which property is located."
6376,13,indiana,6376,"However, a law on ""cracks"" passed on 19 March 2008 limits property tax to 1% of the value assessed for owners, 2% for rental properties and agricultural land, and 3% for businesses."
6377,13,indiana,6377,"Indiana does not have a legal obligation to balance the state budget, neither in law nor in constitution."

6383,13,indiana,6383,"It has 24 coal-fired power plants, including the largest power plant in the country, Gibson Generating Station, which crosses the Wabash River from Mount Carmel, Illinois."
6384,13,indiana,6384,"Indiana is also home to the coal-fired power plant with the highest sulphur dioxide emissions in the United States, the Gallagher power plant, just west of New Albany."
6385,13,indiana,6385,"In 2010, Indiana had estimated coal reserves at 57 billion tons, and the State ' s mining activities produced 35 million tons of coal per year."
6386,13,indiana,6386,"Indiana also has at least 900 million barrels of oil reserves in the Trenton field, although they are not readily recoverable."
6387,13,indiana,6387,"While Indiana has committed to increasing the use of renewable resources such as wind, hydro, biomass or solar energy, progress has been very slow, mainly due to the continued abundance of coal in southern Indiana."
6388,13,indiana,6388,Most of the new state facilities have been coal gasification plants.
6389,13,indiana,6389,Another source is hydropower.
6390,13,indiana,6390,Wind energy has been developed.
6391,13,indiana,6391,"The 2006 estimates increased Indiana's wind capacity from 30 MW to 50 m in height to 40,000 MW in height to 70 m and 130,000 MW in height to 100 m in 2010."

6395,13,indiana,6395,"Other major airports include the Evansville Regional Airport, the Fort Wayne International Airport (which houses 122 National Air Guard Fighter Wing) and the South Bend International Airport."
6396,13,indiana,6396,A long-standing proposal to transform Gary Chicago International Airport into the third major Chicago airport received a boost in early 2006 with $48 million in federal funding approved over the next ten years.
6397,13,indiana,6397,"No airlines operate from the Terre Haute regional airport, but it is used for private aircraft."
6398,13,indiana,6398,"Since 1954, the 181 Wing Fighter of the Indian National Air Guard has been stationed there, but the 2005 Realignment and Closure Base (BRAC) proposal indicated that the 181st would lose its fighter mission and F-16 aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility with a combat aircraft facility."
6399,13,indiana,6399,"Louisville International Airport, opposite the Ohio River in Louisville, Kentucky, serves southern Indiana, as does Cincinnati/North Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Kentucky."

6402,13,indiana,6402,"The various roads that intersect in and around Indianapolis, as well as its historic status as the main railway hub, and the canals that crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the crossroad of America."
6403,13,indiana,6403,There are also many American highways and state highways maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation.
6404,13,indiana,6404,These are numbered according to the same convention as the United States.
6405,13,indiana,6405,Highways.
6406,13,indiana,6406,Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number.
6407,13,indiana,6407,"For example, I-64 and Indiana State Road 64 both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two separate roads that are unrelated to each other."
6408,13,indiana,6408,A $3 billion project covering the period I-69 is under way.
6409,13,indiana,6409,"The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (relating Evansville to Martinsville) now completed."
6410,13,indiana,6410,The sixth and final phase for Indianapolis is being planned.
6411,13,indiana,6411,"Once completed, the I-69 will cross 142 additional miles (229 km) across the state."
6412,13,indiana,6412,"Most Indiana counties use a network-based system to identify county roads; this system has replaced the old arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) it is much easier to identify the call sources placed in the 9-1-1 system."
6413,13,indiana,6413,These systems are easier to implement in the glacially flat northern and central parts of the state.
6414,13,indiana,6414,"Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on non-systematic road names (e.g. Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott and Washington counties)."
6415,13,indiana,6415,There are also counties in the northern parts of the state that have never set up a grid or implemented only a part of it.
6416,13,indiana,6416,"Some counties are also located in a grid system that is almost similar to that of diamonds (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson and Knox counties)."
6417,13,indiana,6417,Such a system is also almost useless in these situations too.
6418,13,indiana,6418,"One day, Knox County used two different network systems for county roads because the county was developed using two different surveying systems, but it has since decided to use road names and to combine roads."
6419,13,indiana,6419,"In particular, the road network in St. Joseph County, whose main city is South Bend, uses perennial tree names (i.e., the name of the species)."
6420,13,indiana,6420,"Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.)"
6421,13,indiana,6421,"in alphabetical order for north-south roads and presidential names and other notable names (i.e. Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.)"
6422,13,indiana,6422,in alphabetical order for east-west roads.
6423,13,indiana,6423,There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka.
6424,13,indiana,6424,The east-west roads of Hamilton County continue the numbered Indianapolis street network from 96th Street to Marion County Line to 296th Street at Tipton County Line.
6425,13,indiana,6425,"Indiana has over 4,255 miles of track, 91 percent of which are operated by Class I railways, primarily CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway."
6426,13,indiana,6426,"Other Class I railways in Indiana include the Canadian National Railway and the Soo Line Railway, a subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as Amtrak."
6427,13,indiana,6427,"The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, switching and terminal railways."
6428,13,indiana,6428,"The South Shore Line is one of the largest suburban rail networks in the country, extending from Chicago to South Bend."
6429,13,indiana,6429,Indiana is implementing a comprehensive railway plan prepared in 2002 by Parsons Corporation.

6431,13,indiana,6431,"Indiana ships more than 70 million tons of goods annually by water, which ranks 14th among all U.S. states."
6432,13,indiana,6432,"More than half of the Indiana border is water, which includes 400 miles (640 km) of direct access to two major freight arteries: the Great Lakes/St."
6433,13,indiana,6433,Lawrence Seaway (via Lake Michigan) and the inland waterway system (via Ohio River).

6435,13,indiana,6435,"In Evansville, three public port facilities and several private port facilities are served year-round by five main barge lines operating on the Ohio River."
6436,13,indiana,6436,Evansville has been a U.S. Customs port of entry for over 125 years.
6437,13,indiana,6437,"For this reason, it is possible to have international goods shipped to Evansville in customs."
6438,13,indiana,6438,International freight can then clear customs in Evansville rather than a coastal port.
6439,13,indiana,6439,Indiana's constitution of 1816 was the first in the country to establish a publicly funded public school system.
6440,13,indiana,6440,It also awarded a canton to a public university.
6441,13,indiana,6441,"However, the plan proved far too idealistic for a pioneering society, as tax money was not available to its organization."
6442,13,indiana,6442,"In the 1840s Caleb Mills insisted on the need for tax-funded schools, and in 1851, his councils were included in the new state constitution."
6443,13,indiana,6443,"In 1843, the legislature decreed that African Americans could not attend public schools, leading to the founding of the Union Literary Institute and other schools for them, financed by donations or students themselves."
6444,13,indiana,6444,"Although the growth of the public school system was hampered by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were used in 1870."
6445,13,indiana,6445,"Most Indiana children attend public schools, but nearly ten per cent attend private and parish schools."
6446,13,indiana,6446,About half of Indiana's students are enrolled in state-funded four-year schools.
6447,13,indiana,6447,Indiana's public schools have undergone several changes throughout Indiana's history.

6541,14,iowa,6541,"Much of the Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805, but it was only when Fort Madison was built in 1808 that the United States established tenuous military control over the area."
6542,14,iowa,6542,"Fort Madison was built to control the trade and establish American domination over Upper Mississippi, but it was misconceived and not loved by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom were allies with the British, who had not abandoned the claims of the territory."
6543,14,iowa,6543,"Fort Madison was defeated by the British-backed natives in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby, on the Dog Prairie in Wisconsin, also fell into British hands."

6549,14,iowa,6549,"A disputed treaty of 1804 between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison, which delivered much of Illinois to the United States, enraged many Sauk and led to the Black Hawk War of 1832."
6550,14,iowa,6550,"The Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley in 1832 in the purchase of Black Hawk and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of which settled in a reserve in Kansas."
6551,14,iowa,6551,"Many Meskwaki then returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the Meskwaki settlement remains to date."
6552,14,iowa,6552,"In 1856, the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented law allowing Meskawki to buy land."
6553,14,iowa,6553,"However, contrary to the unprecedented act of the Iowa Legislature, the U.S. federal government, through the use of treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk of Iowa in 1848, and the Dakota of Iowa in 1858."
6554,14,iowa,6554,The Western Iowa around Bluffs of the Modern Council was used as an Indian reserve for the members of the Council of the Three Fires.

6560,14,iowa,6560,"On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th State of the Union when President James K. Polk signed the Iowa Admission Bill."
6561,14,iowa,6561,"Once admitted to the Union, the State's border problems resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Aboriginal people, Iowa gave its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the rich agricultural land of the young border state, good citizens, free and open society, and good government."
6562,14,iowa,6562,Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs.
6563,14,iowa,6563,The first and second Iowa State Fairs took place in the more developed eastern part of the state in Fairfield.
6564,14,iowa,6564,"The first fair was held from October 25 to 27, 1854, for a cost of approximately $323."
6565,14,iowa,6565,"Subsequently, the fair moved to places closer to the centre of the state and in 1886 found a permanent house in Des Moines."
6566,14,iowa,6566,"Since then, the State Fair has been held every year, with a few exceptions: 1898 due to the war between Spain and America and the World Fair in Omaha, Nebraska, nearby; 1942 to 1945 due to the Second World War, because the fairs were used as a supply depot for the army; and 2020 due to the VOCID-19 pandemic in the United States."
6567,14,iowa,6567,"The Iowa supported the Union during the civil war, voting strongly for Abraham Lincoln, although there was an anti-war movement ""Copperhead"" in the state, caused in part by a fall in crop prices caused by the war."
6568,14,iowa,6568,"There were no battles in the state, although the Battle of Athens, the Missouri, 1861, was fought just opposite the River Des Moines of Croton, the Iowa, and the shots of the battle landed in the Iowa."
6569,14,iowa,6569,The Iowa sent great food to the armies and eastern cities.
6570,14,iowa,6570,"Much of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to Samuel J. Kirkwood, his first governor in wartime."
6571,14,iowa,6571,"Out of a total population of 675,000, approximately 116,000 men were subjected to military functions."
6572,14,iowa,6572,"Iowa contributed proportionally more men to the military service of the civil war than any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, more than a sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates went to Appomattox."
6573,14,iowa,6573,Most of them fought in the large countryside in the Mississippi Valley and in the South.

6580,14,iowa,6580,"After the civil war, the population of Iowa continued to grow considerably, from 674,913 in 1860 to 1,624,615 in 1880."
6581,14,iowa,6581,The American Civil War briefly brought higher profits.
6582,14,iowa,6582,"In 1917, the United States entered the First World War, and farmers and all Iowans experienced a wartime economy."
6583,14,iowa,6583,"For farmers, change has been important."
6584,14,iowa,6584,"Since the beginning of the war in 1914, farmers in Iowa have enjoyed economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war."
6585,14,iowa,6585,"In the economic sector, Iowa has also undergone considerable changes."
6586,14,iowa,6586,"Starting from the first industries developed in the 1830s, mainly for the processing of materials grown in the region, Iowa experienced a gradual increase in the number of enterprises and manufacturing operations."
6587,14,iowa,6587,The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy has been slow.
6588,14,iowa,6588,"The Great Depression and the Second World War accelerated the transition from smallholder agriculture to larger farms, and began a trend towards urbanization."
6589,14,iowa,6589,The period after the Second World War was marked by a particular increase in manufacturing activities.
6590,14,iowa,6590,"The agricultural crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing the poverty that has not been observed since the depression."

7611,16,kentucky,7611,"Of the categories subject to local taxation, three have special rates set by the General Assembly, one by the Supreme Court of Kentucky and the others are subject to the local rate as a whole, which includes the tax rate set by local tax bodies, plus all the levies voted."

7621,16,kentucky,7621,We soon realized that the slogan did not encourage tourism as much as we hoped at the outset.
7622,16,kentucky,7622,So the government decided to create a different slogan to embrace Kentucky as a whole while encouraging more people to visit Bluegrass.
7623,16,kentucky,7623,"In 2004, Governor Ernie Fletcher launched an extensive branding campaign in the hope of making the government's advertising budget of $12 to $14 million more effective."
7624,16,kentucky,7624,"The resulting ""Unbridled Spirit"" brand is the result of a $500,000 contract with New West, a Kentucky-based advertising and public relations marketing company, to develop a viable brand and label line."

7927,17,louisiana,7927,The former slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies.
7928,17,louisiana,7928,"By the end of 1721 New Orleans had 1,256 inhabitants, about half of whom were slaves."
7929,17,louisiana,7929,"In 1724 the French government published a law called Code Noir (""Code Noir"" in English) which ""regulates the interaction of white [white] and black [black] in its colony of Louisiana (which was much greater than the present state of Louisiana)."
7930,17,louisiana,7930,"The law contained 57 articles regulating religion in the colony, prohibited ""interracial"" marriages (those between people of different skin colour, whose varying nuances were also defined by law), restricted the Manumission, described the legal penalties imposed on slaves for various offences and defined certain obligations of the owners towards their slaves."
7931,17,louisiana,7931,The main intention of the French government was to assert control over the system of slavery of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on the owners of slaves.
7932,17,louisiana,7932,"In practice, the Black Code was extremely difficult to apply by far."
7933,17,louisiana,7933,"Some priests continued to celebrate interracial marriages, for example, and some slave owners continued to handle slaves without permission, while others brutally punished slaves."
7934,17,louisiana,7934,"Article II of the Black Code of 1724 obliges the owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the State religion, Roman Catholicism."
7935,17,louisiana,7935,Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves.
7936,17,louisiana,7936,"On days off, slaves were expected to feed themselves and take care of themselves."
7937,17,louisiana,7937,"During the 1740s, the economic crisis in the colony, the owners had difficulty feeding their slaves and themselves."
7938,17,louisiana,7938,"Giving them free time also gave more power to the slaves, who began to cultivate their own gardens and make objects for sale as their own property."
7939,17,louisiana,7939,They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while increasing independence and self-subsistence.
7940,17,louisiana,7940,"Article VI of the Black Code prohibits mixed marriages, prohibits mixed marriages, but hardly protects women slaves against the rape of their owners, overseers or other slaves."
7941,17,louisiana,7941,"Overall, the Code benefits the owners but has more protections and flexibility than the establishment of slavery in the 13 southern colonies."
7942,17,louisiana,7942,"The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 makes cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers are rarely prosecuted for such acts."
7943,17,louisiana,7943,"Fugitive slaves, called marons, could easily hide in the hinterland of bayous people and survive in small settlements."
7944,17,louisiana,7944,"The word ""maron"" comes from the Spanish ""cimarron"", which means ""fugal bovin""."
7945,17,louisiana,7945,"At the end of the 18th century, the last Spanish governor of Louisiana wrote:"
7946,17,louisiana,7946,"When the United States bought Louisiana in 1803, it was quickly accepted that African slaves could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighbouring Mississippi, although it violated American law to do so."
7947,17,louisiana,7947,"Despite the demands of Rep. James Hillhouse of the United States and the brochure Thomas Paine to apply the federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory, slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the cheapest work."
7948,17,louisiana,7948,"At the beginning of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small sugar producer with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Santo Domingo and the West Indies."
7949,17,louisiana,7949,"Shortly thereafter, he became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations."
7950,17,louisiana,7950,"William C. C. Claiborne, the first American governor of Louisiana, said that the work of African slaves was necessary because white workers ""can't have in this unhealthy climate."""
7951,17,louisiana,7951,"Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to implement the abolition of the slave trade in Africa, which the United States and Great Britain adopted in 1808."
7952,17,louisiana,7952,"The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including coastal trade, the shipping of slaves along the Atlantic coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports."
7953,17,louisiana,7953,"In 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the United States, making a major contribution to the economy of the city and the state."
7954,17,louisiana,7954,"New Orleans had become one of the richest cities, and the third largest city in the nation."
7955,17,louisiana,7955,The ban on the African slave trade and the import of slaves has increased demand in the domestic market.
7956,17,louisiana,7956,"Over the decades since the American Revolutionary War, more than one million African slaves have been forced to migrate from the South to the South, two thirds of them in the slave trade."
7957,17,louisiana,7957,Others were transported by their owners as slave owners moved westward to find new land.
7958,17,louisiana,7958,"With the shift in agriculture in the Upper South as planters moved from tobacco to low-labour-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had surplus workers."
7959,17,louisiana,7959,Many sold slaves to traders to take them to the deep South.
7960,17,louisiana,7960,Slaves were driven by Upper South traders or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by boat as part of the slave trade on the coast.
7961,17,louisiana,7961,"After sales to New Orleans, steamboats operating on Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations in Natchez and Memphis."
7962,17,louisiana,7962,The Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800.
7963,17,louisiana,7963,"Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place in Santo Domingo, following a slave rebellion that began in 1791."
7964,17,louisiana,7964,"Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana on the island, including ethnic Europeans, people of free colour, and African slaves, some of whom were brought by each free group."
7965,17,louisiana,7965,"They have significantly increased the Francophone population of New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and slaves have strengthened African culture in the city."
7966,17,louisiana,7966,"The process of independence in Santo Domingo was complex, but the uprisings continued."
7967,17,louisiana,7967,"In 1803 France withdrew its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two thirds sent to the island two years earlier, mainly with yellow fever."
7968,17,louisiana,7968,"In 1804, Haiti, the second republic of the Western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, carried out by slave leaders."
7969,17,louisiana,7969,"Pierre Clément de Laussat (Governor, 1803) says: ""Saint-Domingue is, of all our colonies in the West Indies, the one whose mentality and customs have most influenced Louisiana."""
7970,17,louisiana,7970,"When the United States gained independence from Britain in 1783, one of its main concerns was to have European power at its western border and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River."
7971,17,louisiana,7971,"As American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachians constituted an obstacle to the shipment of goods to the east."
7972,17,louisiana,7972,"The easiest way to ship the products was to use a flat boat to float it in Ohio and Mississippi to the port of New Orleans, where the goods could be placed on ocean vessels."
7973,17,louisiana,7973,The problem with this road was that the Spaniards had both sides of Mississippi under Natchez.
7974,17,louisiana,7974,Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana implied the creation of a new empire focused on the Caribbean sugar trade.
7975,17,louisiana,7975,"Under the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain referred the French to the ownership of the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe."
7976,17,louisiana,7976,"Napoleon regarded Louisiana as a deposit for these sugar islands, and as a buffer for the American establishment."
7977,17,louisiana,7977,"In October 1801 he sent a great military force to take over Santo Domingo, then under the control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.When the army led by Napoleon Leclerc's brother-in-law was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana."
7978,17,louisiana,7978,"Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was troubled by Napoleon's plans to re-establish the French colonies in America."
7979,17,louisiana,7979,"With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close Mississippi to the American trade at any time."
7980,17,louisiana,7980,"Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, American minister in France, to negotiate for the purchase of the city of New Orleans, parts of the east shore of Mississippi, and the free navigation of the river for American trade."
7981,17,louisiana,7981,Livingston was allowed to pay up to $2 million.
7982,17,louisiana,7982,"An official transfer from Louisiana to the French property had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's agreement with the Spaniards was a poorly guarded secret at the border."
7983,17,louisiana,7983,"On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, the acting intendant of Louisiana, announced Spain's intention to revoke the deposit in New Orleans for any cargo originating in the United States."
7984,17,louisiana,7984,The closure of this vital port in the United States caused anger and dismay.
7985,17,louisiana,7985,Trade in the West has been virtually blocked.
7986,17,louisiana,7986,"Historians believe that the revocation of the deposit was caused by the abuses committed by the Americans, in particular by smuggling, and not by the French intrigues, as was believed at the time."
7987,17,louisiana,7987,"President Jefferson ignored public pressure for the war with France, and appointed James Monroe as special envoy to Napoleon, to help secure New Orleans for the United States."
7988,17,louisiana,7988,Jefferson also increased the authorized expenditures to $10 million.
7989,17,louisiana,7989,"However, on April 11, 1803 French Foreign Minister Talleyrand surprised Livingston by asking him how willing the United States was to pay for the whole of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered it)."
7990,17,louisiana,7990,"Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon could withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them without the possibility of obtaining the desired area of New Orleans), and that President Jefferson's approval could take months, so that Livingston and Monroe decided to open the negotiations immediately."
7991,17,louisiana,7991,"As at 30 April, they entered into a transaction for the purchase of the entire territory of Louisiana of 828,000 square miles (2,100,000 km2) for sixty million francs (approximately $15 million)."
7992,17,louisiana,7992,Part of this $3.5 million was used to repay France's debts to the United States.
7993,17,louisiana,7993,"The payment was made in U.S. bonds, which Napoleon sold in nominal value to the Dutch company Hope and Company, and to the British bank house in Baring, at a discount of $871⁄2 per unit of $100."
7994,17,louisiana,7994,"As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana."
7995,17,louisiana,7995,"The English banker Alexander Baring confided Marbois to Paris, went to the United States to recover the bonds, took them to Great Britain and returned to France with the money Napoleon was waging war against his own country."
7996,17,louisiana,7996,"When news of the purchase arrived in the United States, Jefferson was surprised."
7997,17,louisiana,7997,He had authorized an expenditure of $10 million for a port city and received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a set of lands that would double the size of the country.
7998,17,louisiana,7998,"Jefferson's political opponents in the Federalist Party argued that the purchase of Louisiana was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or the negotiation of treaties without the consent of the senator."
7999,17,louisiana,7999,"What really worries the opposition is the new states that will inevitably be cut off from Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England's federalists in national affairs."
8000,17,louisiana,8000,"President Jefferson was a strong supporter of westward expansion, and he strongly supported the treaty."
8001,17,louisiana,8001,"Despite federalist objections, the U.S. Senators ratified the Treaty of Louisiana on October 20, 1803."
8002,17,louisiana,8002,"By law promulgated on 31 October 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories transferred by France and to ensure initial governance."
8003,17,louisiana,8003,"A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803."
8004,17,louisiana,8004,"Since Louisiana territory had never been officially handed over to the French, the Spaniards removed their flag, and the French raised their flag."
8005,17,louisiana,8005,"The next day, General James Wilkinson accepted the possession of New Orleans for the United States."
8006,17,louisiana,8006,"A similar ceremony took place in Saint-Louis on 9 March 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag."
8007,17,louisiana,8007,"The next day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the first United States"
8008,17,louisiana,8008,The artillery marched its troops in the city and ran the American flag on the mast of the fort.
8009,17,louisiana,8009,"Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States Government, represented by Meriwether Lewis."
8010,17,louisiana,8010,"Louisiana's territory, purchased for less than three hundred per acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without war or loss of a single American life, and created a precedent for buying territory."
8011,17,louisiana,8011,It paved the way for the expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.
8012,17,louisiana,8012,"Shortly after the acquisition of possession by the United States, the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on 26 March 1804, thus organizing the territory of Orleans to the south and the district of Louisiana (later formed as the territory of Louisiana) to the north."
8013,17,louisiana,8013,"Louisiana became the eighteenth American state on April 30, 1812; the territory of Orleans became the state of Louisiana and the territory of Louisiana simultaneously became the territory of Missouri."
8014,17,louisiana,8014,An area known as Florida Parishes was soon annexed to Louisiana on 14 April 1812.
8015,17,louisiana,8015,"From 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a two-party system, with democrats competing first with Whigs, then with Know Nothings, and finally only with other democrats."
8016,17,louisiana,8016,"According to the 1860 census, 331,726 people were enslaved, or nearly 47 per cent of the total population of the State, or 708,002 people."
8017,17,louisiana,8017,"The strong economic interest of the elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to separate from the Union on January 26, 1861."
8018,17,louisiana,8018,He followed other southern states in secession after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States.
8019,17,louisiana,8019,The secession of Louisiana was announced on 26 January 1861 and became an integral part of the Confederate States of America.
8020,17,louisiana,8020,"The state was quickly defeated in the civil war, the result of the Union's strategy to cut Confederation into two by seizing Mississippi."
8021,17,louisiana,8021,The federal troops captured New Orleans on 25 April 1862.
8022,17,louisiana,8022,"Because a large part of the population had sympathies with the Union (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own representatives elected to the American Congress."
8023,17,louisiana,8023,"After the civil war and the emancipation of slaves, violence intensified in the South as the war was waged by private and paramilitary rebel groups."
8024,17,louisiana,8024,"Initially, state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who adopted black codes to regulate free men and generally refused to vote."
8025,17,louisiana,8025,They refused to extend the right to vote to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans).
8026,17,louisiana,8026,"Following the Memphis riots in 1866 and the riot in New Orleans that same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted which provided the vote and full citizenship for the liberated men."
8027,17,louisiana,8027,"Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, creating military districts for states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana."
8028,17,louisiana,8028,It was grouped with Texas in what was administered as the fifth military district.
8029,17,louisiana,8029,African-Americans have begun to live as citizens with some equality before the law.
8030,17,louisiana,8030,"Freed men and people of colour who had been free before the war began to make more progress in education, family stability and employment."
8031,17,louisiana,8031,"At the same time, there was enormous social volatility in the aftermath of the war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labour market."
8032,17,louisiana,8032,"White insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy, first in Ku Klux Klan's chapters."
8033,17,louisiana,8033,"In 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, White Democrats in Louisiana and other states regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the White League, which eliminated black voting through intimidation and violence."
8034,17,louisiana,8034,"Like the Mississippi in 1890, in 1898, the white, democratic, planter-dominated legislature adopted a new constitution that effectively deprived people of colour of their rights by raising barriers to voter registration, such as voting taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests."
8035,17,louisiana,8035,The effect was immediate and lasting.
8036,17,louisiana,8036,"In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the lists of electors and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the population of the State, which was also divided."
8037,17,louisiana,8037,"In 1900, the population of the State was 47 per cent African-American, a total of 652,013 citizens."
8038,17,louisiana,8038,"Many in New Orleans were descendants of coloured Creoles, the large population of colour free people before the civil war."
8039,17,louisiana,8039,"In 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state."
8040,17,louisiana,8040,"In 1910, there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5% of eligible African American men), despite the progress made in the education and literacy of blacks and people of colour."
8041,17,louisiana,8041,Blacks were excluded from the political system and unable to serve on juries.
8042,17,louisiana,8042,"The White Democrats established a one-party democratic regime, which they maintained in the state for decades deep in the 20th century until Congress passed the 1965 law on voting rights ensures federal control and the application of the constitutional right to vote."
8043,17,louisiana,8043,"In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African-Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration northward to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings."
8044,17,louisiana,8044,The infestation of the plow and agricultural problems have cost many farmers and farmers their jobs.
8045,17,louisiana,8045,The mechanization of agriculture has also reduced the need for workers.
8046,17,louisiana,8046,"From the 1940s, Blacks went to California for jobs in its expanding defence industries."
8047,17,louisiana,8047,"During part of the Great Depression, Louisiana was led by Governor Huey Long."
8048,17,louisiana,8048,He was elected on populist appeal.
8049,17,louisiana,8049,"His public works projects provided thousands of jobs for people in need, and he supported education and increased the vote for the poor whites, but Long was criticized for his supposedly democratic and autocratic style."
8050,17,louisiana,8050,He extended the control of favouritism to all branches of the Louisiana government.
8051,17,louisiana,8051,His plans to redistribute wealth in the state were particularly controversial.
8052,17,louisiana,8052,Long's rule came to an abrupt end when he was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.
8053,17,louisiana,8053,Mobilization for the Second World War created jobs in the state.
8054,17,louisiana,8054,But thousands of other black and white workers have migrated to California for better jobs in its booming defence industry.
8055,17,louisiana,8055,"Many African-Americans left the state during the Second Great Migration, from the 1940s to the 1960s, to escape social oppression and seek better jobs."
8056,17,louisiana,8056,The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had greatly reduced the need for workers.
8057,17,louisiana,8057,"They were looking for skilled jobs in the defence industry in California, better education for their children and living in communities where they could vote."
8058,17,louisiana,8058,"On 26 November 1958, at Chennault Air Base, a USF B-47 bomber with nuclear weapons on board fired on the ground."

8062,17,louisiana,8062,"In 1960, the State established the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation."
8063,17,louisiana,8063,"Despite this, the registration and participation rate of black voters has gradually increased to 20 per cent or more, and it was 32 per cent in 1964, when the first national legislation on civil rights of the time was adopted."
8064,17,louisiana,8064,"In those years, the percentage of black voters varied considerably in the state, from 93.8% in the evangelical parish to 1.7% in the parish of Tensas, for example, where there were white efforts to suppress the vote in the parish with a black majority."
8065,17,louisiana,8065,"Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill cities were the catalyst for the creation of the first two chapters of the Deacons of Defence and Justice in late 1964 and early 1965, respectively, in Jonesboro and Bogalusa."
8066,17,louisiana,8066,"Composed of Second World War and Korean War veterans, they were armed self-defence groups established to protect activists and their families."

8091,17,louisiana,8091,Louisiana entered the first phase of the re-opening of the state on 15 May.
8092,17,louisiana,8092,"On June 4, Governor John Bel Edwards signed an Order-in-Council that moved to the second phase."
8093,17,louisiana,8093,The government.
8094,17,louisiana,8094,Edwards extended the second phase until September 11 and the third phase began with speculation on October 9.
8095,17,louisiana,8095,Louisiana is bordered to the west by Texas
8096,17,louisiana,8096,"The state can be properly divided into two parts, the northern highlands, and the alluvial along the coast."
8097,17,louisiana,8097,"The alluvial region includes low marshlands, coastal marshes and beaches, and barrier islands that cover approximately 20,000 square miles (52,000 km2)."
8098,17,louisiana,8098,"This area is mainly along the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi, which crosses the state from north to south for a distance of about 600 mi (970 km) and flows into the Gulf of Mexico, the Red River, the Ouachita River and its branches, and other minor streams (some of which are called bayous)."
8099,17,louisiana,8099,"The width of the alluvial region along Mississippi is 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100 km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region has an average of about 10 miles (15 km) across."
8100,17,louisiana,8100,"The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as leve), from which the land declines to a river beyond an average fall of six feet per mile (3 m/km)."
8101,17,louisiana,8101,Alluvial lands along other streams have similar characteristics.
8102,17,louisiana,8102,"The upper and contiguous hills of the northern and north-western parts of the State have an area of more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 km2)."
8103,17,louisiana,8103,They consist of meadows and forests.
8104,17,louisiana,8104,Altitudes above sea level range from 10 feet (3 m) on the coast and marshy lands to 50-60 feet (15-18 m) on grasslands and alluvial lands.
8105,17,louisiana,8105,"In the highlands and hills, elevations rise to Mount Driskill, the highest point in the state at only 535 feet (163 m) above sea level."
8106,17,louisiana,8106,"From 1932 to 2010, the state lost 1,800 square miles due to sea level rise and erosion."
8107,17,louisiana,8107,"The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPAR) spends approximately $1 billion annually to assist in the establishment and protection of the shores and lands of Louisiana, both at the federal and state levels."
8108,17,louisiana,8108,"In addition to the previously named rivers, there are the Sabine River, which forms the western boundary; and the Pearl River, the eastern boundary; the Calcasieu River, the Mermentau River, the Vermilion River, the Bayou Teche, the Atchafalaya, the Boeuf River, the Bayou Lafourche River, the Courpainting River, the Bayou D'Arbonne River, the Macon River, the Tensas River, the Amite River, the Cheminuncte River, the Tickfaw River, the Natalbany River and a number of other smaller rivers, constituting a natural network of navigable rivers, more than 6,400 km long."
8109,17,louisiana,8109,The State also has political jurisdiction over the portion of approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) of underwater land on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico.
8110,17,louisiana,8110,"Thanks to a particular feature of the political geography of the United States, it is a territory far less than the 9-mile (14-km) jurisdiction of the neighbouring states of Texas and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have vast Gulf coasts."
8111,17,louisiana,8111,The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is one of the most disparate regions in the world.
8112,17,louisiana,8112,This is largely due to human mismanagement of the coast (see Wetlands of Louisiana).
8113,17,louisiana,8113,"At one point, the land was added as spring flooding of the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated the growth of the marshes; the land is now shrinking."
8114,17,louisiana,8114,There are several causes.
8115,17,louisiana,8115,Artificial dikes block spring floodwater that would bring fresh water and sediment to the marshes.
8116,17,louisiana,8116,"The marshes have been widely exploited, leaving canals and ditches that allow saltwater to move inland."
8117,17,louisiana,8117,"Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move seawater inward, damaging marshes and marshes."
8118,17,louisiana,8118,The rise of seawater has aggravated the problem.
8119,17,louisiana,8119,Some researchers estimate that the state loses land mass equivalent to 30 football fields a day.
8120,17,louisiana,8120,"There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including the restoration of the natural floods in Mississippi."
8121,17,louisiana,8121,"Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear."
8122,17,louisiana,8122,"And as communities disappear, more and more people leave the region."
8123,17,louisiana,8123,"Since coastal wetlands support economically important coastal fisheries, the loss of wetlands negatively affects this industry."
8124,17,louisiana,8124,"The ""dead zone"" of the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana is the largest recurrent hypoxic zone in the United States."
8125,17,louisiana,8125,"In 2017, it was the highest record ever recorded."
8126,17,louisiana,8126,"The Gulf of Mexico did not exist 250 million years ago when there was only one supercontinent, Pangea."
8127,17,louisiana,8127,"As Pangea separated, the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico opened."
8128,17,louisiana,8128,"Louisiana has slowly developed over millions of years from water to land, and from north to south."
8129,17,louisiana,8129,"The oldest rocks are exposed in the north, in areas such as the Kisatchie National Forest."
8130,17,louisiana,8130,"The oldest rocks date back to the early Cenozoic era, about 60 million years ago."
8131,17,louisiana,8131,The history of the formation of these rocks is found in D. Spearing's Roadside Louisiana Geology.
8132,17,louisiana,8132,"The youngest regions of the state have been formed over the past 12,000 years as successive Mississippi deltas: the Maringouin, Teche, St. Bernard, Lafourche, the modern Mississippi, and now the Atchafalaya."
8133,17,louisiana,8133,The sediments were transported from north to south by the Mississippi River.
8134,17,louisiana,8134,"Between the tertiary rocks of the north and the relatively new sediments along the coast, there is a large belt known as Terrasses du Pleistocene."
8135,17,louisiana,8135,Their age and distribution can be largely related to sea-level rise and fall in the late ice ages.
8136,17,louisiana,8136,"In general, the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep canals, while the more recent terraces tend to be much flattered."
8137,17,louisiana,8137,There are also salty domes in Louisiana.
8138,17,louisiana,8138,Their origin dates back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean experienced high rates of evaporation.
8139,17,louisiana,8139,"There are several hundred salty domes in the state; one of the most familiar is Avery Island, Louisiana."
8140,17,louisiana,8140,Salt domes are important not only as a source of salt
8141,17,louisiana,8141,"Louisiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with long, warm, humid and short summers, mild winters."
8142,17,louisiana,8142,"The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the Gulf of Mexico, which at its furthest point is not more than 200 mi (320 km)."
8143,17,louisiana,8143,"Rain is common throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the wet season of the state."
8144,17,louisiana,8144,There was a decrease in precipitation in October.
8145,17,louisiana,8145,"In summer, the storms are built during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief tropical showers."
8146,17,louisiana,8146,"In winter, precipitation is more frontal and less intense."
8147,17,louisiana,8147,"Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June to September on average at 90°F (32°C) or higher, and night bass on average at over 70°F (21°C)."
8148,17,louisiana,8148,"Sometimes temperatures in the 90's F, combined with dew points in the 70's F higher, create sensible temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."
8149,17,louisiana,8149,"The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and films."
8150,17,louisiana,8150,"Temperatures are generally warm in winter in the southern part of the state, with peaks around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of southern Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico on average 66°F (19°C)."
8151,17,louisiana,8151,"The northern part of the condition is slightly cool in winter, with average levels of 59°F (15°C)."
8152,17,louisiana,8152,"Night hollows in winter are well above freezing in the entire state, with 46°F (8°C) average near the Gulf and an average low of 37°F (3°C) in winter in the northern part of the state."
8153,17,louisiana,8153,"Occasionally, cold fronts, low pressure centres to the north, reach Louisiana in winter."
8154,17,louisiana,8154,"Low temperatures near 20°F (−7°C) sometimes occur in the northern part of the state, but rarely in the southern part of the state."
8155,17,louisiana,8155,"Snow is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although people in northern parts of the state can receive snow dust a few times a decade."
8156,17,louisiana,8156,"The highest temperature recorded in Louisiana was 114°F (46°C) at Plain Dealing on August 10, 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded was −16°F (−27°C) at Minden on February 13, 1899."
8157,17,louisiana,8157,"Louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to major hurricane strikes, particularly lowland areas around and in the New Orleans region."
8158,17,louisiana,8158,"The unique geography of the region, with the numerous marshes and bayous islets, can cause damage to water through a vast area of major hurricanes."
8159,17,louisiana,8159,"The region is also subject to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer."
8160,17,louisiana,8160,"The entire state is on average more than 60 days of storms per year, more than any other state except Florida."
8161,17,louisiana,8161,Louisiana has an average of 27 tornadoes per year.
8162,17,louisiana,8162,"The entire State is vulnerable to a tornado, with the southernmost part of the State slightly less than the rest of the State."
8163,17,louisiana,8163,"tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the State, and from February to March in the northern part of the State."
8164,17,louisiana,8164,"Because of its location and geology, the state has a great biodiversity."
8165,17,louisiana,8165,"Some vital areas, such as southwestern prairie, have lost more than 98 per cent."
8166,17,louisiana,8166,"Flat pines are also at great risk, mainly due to fire suppression and urban sprawl."
8167,17,louisiana,8167,There is still no well-organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity.
8168,17,louisiana,8168,"Such a system would consist of a protected system of central areas connected by biological corridors, as Florida is planning."
8169,17,louisiana,8169,"Louisiana contains a number of areas that, to varying degrees, prevent people from using them."
8170,17,louisiana,8170,"In addition to the areas of the U.S. National Parks Service and a national forest, Louisiana operates a system of state parks, state historic sites, a state conservation area, a state forest and many wildlife management areas."
8171,17,louisiana,8171,One of the largest public areas in Louisiana is the Kisatchie National Forest.
8172,17,louisiana,8172,"There are about 600,000 acres of land, more than half of which are flat forests, which are home to many rare plant and animal species."
8173,17,louisiana,8173,These include the Louisiana snake and the red peacock pike.
8174,17,louisiana,8174,"The government-owned cypress marsh system around Pontchartrain Lake is another large area, with southern wetland species, including scratches, alligators and sturgeon."
8175,17,louisiana,8175,"At least 12 base areas would be required to build a ""protected area system"" for the state; these areas would extend from the southwest of the Prairies to the Pearl River floodplain to the east, to the Mississippi alluvial marshes in the north."
8176,17,louisiana,8176,"Historic or picturesque areas managed, protected or otherwise recognized by the National Parks Service include:"

8256,17,louisiana,8256,"Per federal tax dollar collected in 2005, citizens of Louisiana received approximately $1.78 in federal expenditures."
8257,17,louisiana,8257,"This is the fourth highest state at the national level and represents an increase from 1995, when Louisiana received $1.35 per dollar of federal spending taxes (the seventh highest in the country)."
8258,17,louisiana,8258,"The neighbouring states and the amount of federal expenditures received per dollar of federal tax collected were Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41) and Mississippi ($2.02)."
8259,17,louisiana,8259,Federal spending in 2005 and subsequent years was exceptionally high due to the resumption of Hurricane Katrina.
8260,17,louisiana,8260,Louisiana is rich in oil and natural gas.
8261,17,louisiana,8261,Oil and gas deposits are abundant on land and offshore in state waters.
8262,17,louisiana,8262,"In addition, large reserves of oil and natural gas are located off Louisiana in the federal-administered outer continental shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico."
8263,17,louisiana,8263,"According to the Energy Information Administration, the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest oil-producing region in the United States."
8264,17,louisiana,8264,"With the exception of the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana is fourth in oil production and accounts for about two per cent of the total oil reserves in the United States."
8265,17,louisiana,8265,Louisiana's natural gas reserves account for about 5% of the U.S. total.
8266,17,louisiana,8266,"The formation of the shade of Haynesville in some parts or all of the parishes Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River and Natchitoches made it the fourth largest gas field in the world with some wells producing initially more than 25 million cubic feet of gas per day."
8267,17,louisiana,8267,"Louisiana was the first oil drilling site on water in the world, on Caddo Lake, in the northwest corner of the state."
8268,17,louisiana,8268,"The oil and gas industry, as well as its subsidiaries such as transportation and refining, has dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s."
8269,17,louisiana,8269,"From 1950, Louisiana was repeatedly pursued by the United States."
8270,17,louisiana,8270,"Ministry of the Interior, in the efforts of the federal government to dislodge Louisiana from its submerged land rights."
8271,17,louisiana,8271,They control large reserves of oil and natural gas.
8272,17,louisiana,8272,"When oil and gas boomed in the 1970s, Louisiana's economy did the same."
8273,17,louisiana,8273,Louisiana's economy and its policy of the last half century cannot be understood without taking full account of the influence of the oil and gas industries.
8274,17,louisiana,8274,"For example, in the 1970s, over 40 per cent of Louisiana's public revenues came directly from mining taxes and royalties."
8275,17,louisiana,8275,"Since the 1980s, the headquarters of these industries have been consolidated in Houston, but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the Gulf of Mexico's crude oil and gas industry remain in Louisiana."
8276,17,louisiana,8276,"Although the energy industry remains an important part of Louisiana's economy, the composition of this industry has changed considerably over time."
8277,17,louisiana,8277,"In 2019, the refining and chemical manufacturing sector employs more people in Louisiana than the upstream oil and gas extraction sector."
8278,17,louisiana,8278,"Louisiana is home to many, particularly notable are the culture distinct from the Louisiana Creoles, typically people of colour, descendants of mixed free families from the colonial and early states."
8279,17,louisiana,8279,The French colony of La Louisiana has struggled for decades to survive.
8280,17,louisiana,8280,"The conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were inadequate for certain crops that settlers knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases."
8281,17,louisiana,8281,The settlers and slaves they imported had high mortality rates.
8282,17,louisiana,8282,"Settlers continued to import slaves, resulting in a high proportion of West Africans, who continued to practice their culture in a new environment."
8283,17,louisiana,8283,"As historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall described, they developed an Afro-Creole culture marked in colonial times."
8284,17,louisiana,8284,"At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a large influx of white and Métis refugees fleeing the violence of the Haitian Revolution, many of whom brought their slaves with them."
8285,17,louisiana,8285,"This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in Santo Domingo were from Africa than in the United States."
8286,17,louisiana,8286,"They have strongly influenced the city's African-American culture in terms of dance, music and religious practices."
8287,17,louisiana,8287,"Creole culture is a fusion of French, African, Spanish (and other European) and Amerindian cultures."
8288,17,louisiana,8288,"Creole comes from the Portuguese word crioulo; originally it refers to a colonist of European origin (specifically French) born in the New World, compared to immigrants from France."
8289,17,louisiana,8289,"Louisiana's oldest manuscript to use the word ""Creole"" from 1782 applied it to a slave born in the French colony."
8290,17,louisiana,8290,"But originally, he referred more generally to French settlers born in Louisiana."
8291,17,louisiana,8291,"Over time, a relatively large group of Creoles de Couleur (free coloured people) developed in the French colony, mainly from African women slaves and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans)."
8292,17,louisiana,8292,The French often free their concubines and their Métis children and pass on social capital to them.
8293,17,louisiana,8293,"They could, for example, educate sons in France and help them enter the French army for a career."
8294,17,louisiana,8294,They also installed property or capital on their mistresses and children.
8295,17,louisiana,8295,The people free of colour gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education
8296,17,louisiana,8296,Many have become artisans and owners.
8297,17,louisiana,8297,"Over time, the term ""Creole"" has become associated with this class of Colour Creoles, many of which obtained freedom well before the civil war."
8298,17,louisiana,8298,Rich French Creoles generally maintained townhouses in New Orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside the city along the Mississippi River.
8299,17,louisiana,8299,"New Orleans has the largest population of colour-free people in the region; they can find work and create their own culture, marrying each other for decades."
8300,17,louisiana,8300,"Cajuns' ancestors immigrated mainly from western central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, originally known as Acadia."
8301,17,louisiana,8301,"After the British defeat of France in the War of France and India (Seven Years' War) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of Mississippi to Britain."
8302,17,louisiana,8302,The British forcibly separated the families and expelled them from Acadia because they refused to make a vow of loyalty to the new British regime.
8303,17,louisiana,8303,"The Acadians were deported to England, New England and France."
8304,17,louisiana,8304,"Some, who escaped the British, remained in French Canada."
8305,17,louisiana,8305,"Others have dispersed in France, Canada, Mexico or the Falkland Islands."
8306,17,louisiana,8306,"Many Acadian refugees settled in southern Louisiana, the Lafayette region and the LaFourche Bayou country."
8307,17,louisiana,8307,"They developed a distinct rural culture, different from the French Creole settlers of New Orleans."
8308,17,louisiana,8308,"By marrying others in the area, they developed what was called music, cooking and Cajun culture."
8309,17,louisiana,8309,"Until the 1970s, the term ""Cajun"" was considered somewhat derogating."
8310,17,louisiana,8310,A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of Isleños.
8311,17,louisiana,8311,"Its members were descendants of settlers from the Canary Islands who settled in Spanish Louisiana between 1778 and 1783 and married other communities such as the French, Acadians, Creoles, Spanish and other groups, mainly during the 19th and early 20th centuries."
8312,17,louisiana,8312,"In Louisiana, Isleños originally settled in four communities, including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria and San Bernardo."
8313,17,louisiana,8313,"Among these colonies, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most prosperous, with the other two suffering from disease and flooding."
8314,17,louisiana,8314,"The large migration of Acadian refugees to Bayou Lafourche led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community, while the community of San Bernardo (Saint Bernard) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language in the 21st century."
8315,17,louisiana,8315,"That being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely stopped in Saint Bernard with those who have the competence in Spanish being octagenary."
8316,17,louisiana,8316,"Over the centuries, the different communities of Isleño de Louisiana have kept alive various elements of their Canaries heritage while adopting and relying on the customs and traditions of the communities around them."
8317,17,louisiana,8317,"Today, two heritage partners exist for the communities: the Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard and the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana."
8318,17,louisiana,8318,"The Fiesta de los Isleños is celebrated every year in the parish of Saint-Bernard, which presents heritage representations of local groups and the Canary Islands."
8319,17,louisiana,8319,"According to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among people aged five and over, 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak English only at home, 3.45% speak French (standard French, French Creole or French Cajun), 3.30% speak Spanish and 0.59% speak Vietnamese."
8320,17,louisiana,8320,"Historically, the Amerindian peoples of the region at the time of the European meeting were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: Caddo, Tunica, Natchez, Houma, Choctaw, Atakapa and Chitimacha."
8321,17,louisiana,8321,"Among them, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have live native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages."
8322,17,louisiana,8322,"Other Amerindian peoples have migrated to the region, escaping from Eastern European pressure."
8323,17,louisiana,8323,"Among them were the Alabama, Biloxi, Koasati and Ofo peoples."
8324,17,louisiana,8324,From the 1700s French settlers began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans.
8325,17,louisiana,8325,They have established institutions of French culture and language.
8326,17,louisiana,8326,"They imported thousands of tribes slaves from West Africa, who spoke several different languages."
8327,17,louisiana,8327,"In the process of Creolization, the slaves developed a Creole dialect of Louisiana incorporating both French and African forms, which the settlers adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery."
8328,17,louisiana,8328,"In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, in particular, who spoke of Louisiana Creole."
8329,17,louisiana,8329,"During the 19th century after the purchase of Louisiana by the United States, English gradually became more important to business and government due to the evolution of the population with the establishment by many Americans who were English-speaking."
8330,17,louisiana,8330,Many ethnic Francophone families continued to use French in private.
8331,17,louisiana,8331,The slaves and some free people of colour also spoke the Creole French of Louisiana.
8332,17,louisiana,8332,"The Constitution of the State of 1812 gives official status to English in judicial proceedings, but the use of French remains widespread."
8333,17,louisiana,8333,The subsequent constitutions of the State reflect the decreasing importance of French.
8334,17,louisiana,8334,"The Constitution of 1868, adopted at the time of the reconstruction before the readmission of Louisiana to the Union, prohibits laws requiring the publication of judicial proceedings in languages other than English."
8335,17,louisiana,8335,"Subsequently, the legal status of the French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its importance before the civil war."
8336,17,louisiana,8336,"Several unique dialects of French, Creole and English are spoken in Louisiana."
8337,17,louisiana,8337,The dialects of the French language are colonial French and houma French.
8338,17,louisiana,8338,Louisiana Creole French is the term of one of the Creole languages.
8339,17,louisiana,8339,"Two unique dialects developed from the English language: Louisiana English, a variety of English with French influence in which the fall of /r/postvocalism is common; and what is unofficially known as Yat, which resembles the New York City dialect sometimes with southern influences, especially that of historic Brooklyn."
8340,17,louisiana,8340,"Both accents were influenced by large Irish and Italian immigrant communities, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish."
8341,17,louisiana,8341,Colonial French was the dominant language of white settlers in Louisiana during the French colonial period
8342,17,louisiana,8342,"In addition to this dialect, the Métis people and slaves developed Louisiana Creole, with a base in West African languages."
8343,17,louisiana,8343,The limited years of Spanish domination at the end of the 18th century did not lead to the widespread adoption of the Spanish language.
8344,17,louisiana,8344,"French Creole and Louisiana are still used in modern Louisiana, often in family gatherings."
8345,17,louisiana,8345,"English and its associated dialects became predominant after the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, after which the region became dominated by many Anglophones."
8346,17,louisiana,8346,"In some areas, English was influenced by French, as was seen with Louisiana English."
8347,17,louisiana,8347,"Colonial French, although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, persisted alongside English."
8348,17,louisiana,8348,"The renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana led to the creation of French immersion schools in the image of Canada, as well as the introduction of bilingual signage in the French historic neighbourhoods of New Orleans and Lafayette."
8349,17,louisiana,8349,"In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the State has maintained the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), which promotes the use of the French language in tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations of the State."

8361,17,louisiana,8361,"The number of students enrolled in private schools in Louisiana decreased by 9% between 2000-2005 and 2014, due to the proliferation of charter schools, the 2008 recession and Hurricane Katrina."
8362,17,louisiana,8362,Ten parishes in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans region recorded a combined decline of 17% in private school enrolment during this period.
8363,17,louisiana,8363,This has prompted private schools to lobby for school vouchers.

8386,17,louisiana,8386,"These include the mayor-counsel, the councillor-manager (in which the council hires a professional director of operations for the parish), and others."
8387,17,louisiana,8387,Louisiana's political and legal structure maintained several elements at the time of French and Spanish governance.
8388,17,louisiana,8388,"One is the use of the term ""parish"" (from the French: parish) instead of ""county"" for the administrative subdivision."
8389,17,louisiana,8389,"Another is the legal system of civil law based on the French, German and Spanish legal codes and, ultimately, Roman law, as opposed to the English common law."
8390,17,louisiana,8390,"Louisiana's civil law system is what most of the nations of the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, to the exclusion of those derived from the British Empire."
8391,17,louisiana,8391,"However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the Napoleonic Code."
8392,17,louisiana,8392,"Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana's law derive their common legal origin, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as enacted in 1804, after the purchase and annexation by the United States of Louisiana in 1803."

8394,17,louisiana,8394,There are differences between Louisiana civil law and the common law of other American states.
8395,17,louisiana,8395,"Although some of these differences have been bridged by the strong influence of the common law tradition, the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana's private law."
8396,17,louisiana,8396,"Thus, the structure of property, contracts, businesses, much of civil and family law, as well as certain aspects of criminal law, are still based mainly on traditional Roman legal thinking."
8397,17,louisiana,8397,"In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or an alliance."
8398,17,louisiana,8398,"In an alliance marriage, the couple renounces their right to a ""no-fault"" divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage."

8400,17,louisiana,8400,"Marriages between ascendants and descendants and marriages between collaterals to the fourth degree (i.e. siblings, aunt and nephew, uncle and niece, first cousins) are prohibited."

8406,17,louisiana,8406,"In many acts of resistance, the Blacks left behind the segregation, violence and oppression of the state and went to look for better opportunities in the industrial cities of the North and West during the Great Migrations of 1910-1970, thereby significantly reducing their proportion of population in Louisiana."
8407,17,louisiana,8407,"The franchise for whites has increased somewhat over these decades, but blacks have essentially been deprived of their rights until after the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, thereby obtaining the application of their constitutional rights through the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by Congress."
8408,17,louisiana,8408,"Since the 1960s, when the Civil Rights Act was passed by President Lyndon Johnson to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have joined the Democratic Party."

8414,17,louisiana,8414,"If no candidate has more than 50% of the votes, the two candidates with the largest number of votes run for election approximately one month later."
8415,17,louisiana,8415,"This method of runoff does not take into account the identification of the party, so it is not uncommon for a democrat to find himself in a runoff with another democrat or republican in a runoff with another republican."
8416,17,louisiana,8416,Congressional races were also held within the framework of the jungle primary system.
8417,17,louisiana,8417,"All other states (with the exception of Washington, California and Maine) use single-party primaries, followed by general elections between party candidates, each conducted by a pluralist voting system or by a second ballot vote, to elect senators, representatives and representatives of the whole state."
8418,17,louisiana,8418,"Between 2008 and 2010, federal elections were held under a closed primary system, limited to members of registered parties."

8914,19,maryland,8914,A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682 was undermined by the fact that Penn received the additional grant of what is now Delaware.

8989,19,maryland,8989,"Beginning in the 1960s, while suburban growth began around Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, the state began to adopt a more mid-Atlantic culture, unlike the traditional southern and tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state."

9419,20,massachusetts,9419,"Most Massachusetts has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers."
9420,20,massachusetts,9420,The coastal areas of the extreme southeast constitute the vast transition zone to humid subtropical climates.
9421,20,massachusetts,9421,"Hot to hot summers make the ocean climate rare in this transition, applying only to exposed coastal areas such as the Barnstable County Peninsula."
9422,20,massachusetts,9422,"The Boston climate is fairly representative for the commonwealth, characterized by summer peaks of about 81°F (27°C) and winter peaks of 35°F (2°C), and is quite humid."
9423,20,massachusetts,9423,"Frosts are common all winter, even in coastal areas due to prevailing internal winds."
9424,20,massachusetts,9424,"Because of its location near the Atlantic, Massachusetts is not vulnerable to easterners, hurricanes and tropical storms."
9425,20,massachusetts,9425,"Climate change in Massachusetts will affect urban and rural environments, including forestry, fisheries, agriculture and coastal development."
9426,20,massachusetts,9426,"The northeast is expected to warm faster than the global average; by 2035, the northeast is expected to be warmer on average at more than 3.6°F (2°C) than in the pre-industrial era."
9427,20,massachusetts,9427,"In August 2016, EPA reported that Massachusetts warmed up by more than two degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.1 degrees Celsius."
9428,20,massachusetts,9428,This is almost double the average of the United States contiguous.
9429,20,massachusetts,9429,Temperature change also results in a change in precipitation patterns and an increase in precipitation.
9430,20,massachusetts,9430,"To this end, average precipitation in the northeastern United States increased by 10 per cent between 1895 and 2011, and the number of high precipitation events increased by 70 per cent during this period."
9431,20,massachusetts,9431,These increased precipitation trends are concentrated in winter and spring.
9432,20,massachusetts,9432,Increased temperatures and increased precipitation will result in earlier snowfalls and drier soils in the summer months.
9433,20,massachusetts,9433,Climate change in Massachusetts will result in a significant change in the built environment and ecosystems.
9434,20,massachusetts,9434,"In Boston alone, the costs of climate change storms will result in damages of $5-100 billion."
9435,20,massachusetts,9435,"These costs are attributable to the expected damage to coastal homes, the destruction of roads and the current exposure to utilities infrastructure."
9436,20,massachusetts,9436,Warmer temperatures will also disrupt bird migration and flowering.

9439,20,massachusetts,9439,"Ticks can transmit the disease once temperatures reach 45 degrees, so shorter winters will increase the transmission window."
9440,20,massachusetts,9440,These warmer temperatures will also increase the prevalence of mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus.
9441,20,massachusetts,9441,"To combat this change, the state of Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has set a course towards decarbonizing the state economy."
9442,20,massachusetts,9442,"On April 22, 2020, Massachusetts Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Kathleen A. Theoharides published a state-wide emission limit determination for 2050."
9443,20,massachusetts,9443,"In its letter, Theoharides points out that as of 2020, the Commonwealth has suffered material damage due to climate change of more than $60 billion."
9444,20,massachusetts,9444,"To ensure that the Commonwealth does not warm up more than 1.5°C of pre-industrial levels, the state will strive to achieve zero net emissions and an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050."
9445,20,massachusetts,9445,"The State of Massachusetts has developed a plethora of incentives to encourage the implementation of renewable energy, appliances and efficient domestic facilities."
9446,20,massachusetts,9446,"Mass Save was formed in collaboration with the state by Berkshire Gas, Blackstone Gas Company, Cape Light Compact, Eversource, Liberty Utilities, National Grid and Unitil to offer homeowners and tenants incentives to upgrade their homes with efficient HVAC equipment and other household appliances."
9447,20,massachusetts,9447,"For example, up to a $100 discount can be obtained for upgrading an ENERGY STAR certified smart or programmable thermostat."

9449,20,massachusetts,9449,The concept of Mass Save was created in 2008 by the adoption of the Green Communities Act 2008 during Deval Patrick's term.
9450,20,massachusetts,9450,The main objective of the Green Communities Act was to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in the State and to encourage the adoption of new and more efficient technologies.
9451,20,massachusetts,9451,"One of the outcomes of the Act was that public service program administrators should invest in energy saving, rather than buying and producing additional energy where economically feasible."
9452,20,massachusetts,9452,"In Massachusetts, eleven program administrators, including NStar, National Grid, Western Massachusetts Electric, Cape Light Compact, Till and Berkshire Gas, jointly hold the program rights, in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy Resources (DOER) and the Advisory Council on Energy Efficiency (CAEE)."
9453,20,massachusetts,9453,"Mass Save also conducts home energy assessments at no cost so that homeowners, tenants and small business owners can learn about energy efficiency home improvements and find opportunities to save money and energy."
9454,20,massachusetts,9454,"During the home evaluation, Mass Save provides ENERGY STAR certified LED bulbs, power bands, low-flow shower heads, faucet aerators and effective thermostats for free."
9455,20,massachusetts,9455,"In addition, leaks of air will be detected in the house or building and corrected, and recommendations will be made to install additional insulation to reduce the loss of heated or cooled air."
9456,20,massachusetts,9456,Reductions of 75% or more are available on these insulation improvements.
9457,20,massachusetts,9457,"Thanks to VOCID-19, Mass Save is currently conducting remote assessments."

9459,20,massachusetts,9459,The State Income Service provides incentives for the installation of solar panels.
9460,20,massachusetts,9460,"In addition to the federal residential renewable energy credit, residents of Massachusetts may be eligible for a tax credit of up to 15 per cent of the project."
9461,20,massachusetts,9461,"Once installed, the tables are eligible for net measurement."
9462,20,massachusetts,9462,"Some municipalities will offer up to $1.20 per watt, up to 50% of the cost of the system on photovoltaic networks of 25 kW or less."
9463,20,massachusetts,9463,The Massachusetts Department of Energy also provides low interest rate fixed-rate financing with loan support to low-income residents.
9464,20,massachusetts,9464,The programme is expected to end on 31 December 2020.
9465,20,massachusetts,9465,"As part of efforts by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources) to encourage the use of renewable energy, the MOR-EV (Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles) initiative was established."
9466,20,massachusetts,9466,"Through this incentive measure, residents may be entitled to a government incentive of up to $2,500 for the purchase or rental of an electric vehicle, or $1,500 for the purchase or rental of a plug-in hybrid vehicle."
9467,20,massachusetts,9467,This rebate is in addition to the tax credits offered by the U.S. Department of Energy for the purchase of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
9468,20,massachusetts,9468,"For income-eligible residents, Mass Save has partnered with the Massachusetts Community Action Program and LEAN (Low-Income Energy Affordability Network) to provide residents with assistance in improving their housing, which will allow for more efficient use of energy."
9469,20,massachusetts,9469,"Residents may be eligible to replace their heating system, insulation system, appliances and thermostats if they meet the income conditions set out on the Mass Save website."
9470,20,massachusetts,9470,"For residents of more than 5 family residential buildings, there are additional benefits limited by disposable income through the LEAN."
9471,20,massachusetts,9471,"If at least 50 per cent of building residents are eligible for low income, energy efficiency improvements such as those available through Mass Save are available."
9472,20,massachusetts,9472,"Residential structures managed by non-profit organizations, for gainful activities or housing organizations can benefit from these programs."
9473,20,massachusetts,9473,"At the end of 2020, the Baker Administration released a roadmap on decarbonization that targets net greenhouse gas emissions by zero by 2050."

9482,20,massachusetts,9482,Massachusetts is the fastest growing state in New England and the 25th fastest growing state in the United States.
9483,20,massachusetts,9483,Population growth is largely due to a relatively high quality of life and a large higher education system in the State.
9484,20,massachusetts,9484,"Foreign immigration is also a factor in the population growth of the state, which means that the population of the state continues to grow from the 2010 census (especially in cities in Massachusetts where the cost of living is lower)."
9485,20,massachusetts,9485,"40 per cent of foreign immigrants came from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, and many from Asia."

10714,23,mississippi,10714,"Heavy snowfalls rarely occur, but are not known, as in the New Year's snowstorm 1963."
10715,23,mississippi,10715,"Annual precipitation generally increases from north to south, with the regions closest to the Gulf being the wettest."
10716,23,mississippi,10716,"For example, Clarksdale, in the northwest, receives about 50 in (1,300 mm) precipitation per year, and Biloxi, in the south, receives about 61 in (1,500 mm)."
10717,23,mississippi,10717,Small snowfalls in northern and central Mississippi
10718,23,mississippi,10718,"The end of summer and fall is the period of seasonal risk for hurricanes moving within the Gulf of Mexico, particularly in the southern part of the state."
10719,23,mississippi,10719,"Hurricane Camille in 1969 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which killed 238 people in the state, were the most devastating hurricanes in the state."
10720,23,mississippi,10720,"Both caused almost total destruction of structures in and around Gulfport, Biloxi and Pascagula."
10721,23,mississippi,10721,"As in the rest of the deep South, thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the southern part of the state."
10722,23,mississippi,10722,"On average, Mississippi has about 27 tornadoes per year; the northern part of the State has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part has a higher frequency later in the year."
10723,23,mississippi,10723,Two of the five most deadly tornadoes in US history occurred in the state.
10724,23,mississippi,10724,"These storms struck Natchez, in the southwest of Mississippi (see The Great Natchez Tornado) and Tupelo, in the northeast corner of the state."
10725,23,mississippi,10725,Approximately seven F5 tornadoes were registered in the State.
10726,23,mississippi,10726,"Mississippi is heavily wooded, with more than half of the state area covered by wild or cultivated trees."
10727,23,mississippi,10727,"The southeastern part of the state is dominated by long-leaved pine, both in the highlands and in the plains and peatlands of Sarracenia."
10728,23,mississippi,10728,"The Mississippi Alluvial Plain, or delta, is mainly agricultural land and aquaculture ponds, but also has extensive areas of cottonwood, willows, bald cypresses and oaks."
10729,23,mississippi,10729,"A loess belt extends from the north to the south in the western part of the state, where the Mississippi Alluvial Plain reaches the first hills; this region is characterized by rich mixed forests of mesic hardwood, some species being disjunct from the Appalachian forests."
10730,23,mississippi,10730,"Two historical prairie bands, the Jackson Prairie and the Black Belt, flow from the northwest to the southeast in the central and northeastern parts of the state."
10731,23,mississippi,10731,"Although these areas have been severely degraded by conversion to agriculture, a few remain, consisting of meadows with forests interspersed with eastern rockfish, oaks, hickories, osage-orange and sugar berries."
10732,23,mississippi,10732,"The rest of the state, mainly north of Interstate 20, excluding the Prairie regions, consists of mixed pine and deciduous forests, common lobolly pine, oak (e.g., water oaks), hickories, sweetgum, and elms."
10733,23,mississippi,10733,"Areas along large rivers are generally inhabited by bald cypress, water tupelo, water elm, and bitter pecan."
10734,23,mississippi,10734,"Commonly cultivated trees include lobolly pine, long-leaved pine, cherry bark oak and cotton wood."
10735,23,mississippi,10735,There are about 3000 known vascular plant species of Mississippi.
10736,23,mississippi,10736,"Starting in 2018, a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation aims to update this list of plants with museum vouchers (herbarium) and create an online atlas for the distribution of each species."
10737,23,mississippi,10737,About 420 species of birds inhabit Mississippi.
10738,23,mississippi,10738,"Mississippi has one of the richest fish faunas in the United States, with 204 species of native fish."
10739,23,mississippi,10739,"Mississippi also has a rich wildlife of freshwater mussels, with about 90 species in the main family of native mussels (Unionidae)."
10740,23,mississippi,10740,Several of these species disappeared during the construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway.
10741,23,mississippi,10741,"Mississippi is home to 63 species of crayfish, including at least 17 endemic species."
10742,23,mississippi,10742,Mississippi is home to eight species of winter sandstone.
10743,23,mississippi,10743,"Due to seasonal flooding, possible from December to June, the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the Mississippi Delta."
10744,23,mississippi,10744,"The flood of the river created natural dikes, which the planters had built earlier to try to prevent flooding of cultivated land for cotton crops."
10745,23,mississippi,10745,Temporary workers built dikes along the Mississippi on the natural dikes that formed from the land deposited after the flood of the river.
10746,23,mississippi,10746,"From 1858 to 1861, the state took over the dam building, performing it through contractors and labour hires."
10747,23,mississippi,10747,"In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to be hired for such dangerous work."
10748,23,mississippi,10748,Entrepreneurs have hired Irish immigrant gangs to build dams and sometimes open land.
10749,23,mississippi,10749,Many Irish were relatively recent immigrants from years of famine who struggled to settle.
10750,23,mississippi,10750,"Prior to the American Civil War, the average height of the dykes was six feet, although in some areas they reached twenty feet."
10751,23,mississippi,10751,"Floods have been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing land for cultivation and wood supply for steamboats has removed the absorption of trees and undergrowth."
10752,23,mississippi,10752,"The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river."
10753,23,mississippi,10753,"After the civil war, major floods ravaged the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882."
10754,23,mississippi,10754,"These floods have regularly submerged the dikes damaged by the Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those built after the war."
10755,23,mississippi,10755,"In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for the southern counties."
10756,23,mississippi,10756,"In 1879, the United States Congress established the Mississippi River Commission, whose responsibilities included assisting state dikes in the construction of dikes."
10757,23,mississippi,10757,"In the late 19th century, temporary white and black workers were hired to build the dykes."
10758,23,mississippi,10758,"By 1882 the average height of the dikes was seven feet, but many in the southern delta were severely tested by flooding that year."
10759,23,mississippi,10759,"After the flood of 1882, the dike system was expanded."
10760,23,mississippi,10760,"In 1884, the district of Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee was established to oversee the construction and maintenance of dykes in the northern counties of the delta, and included some Arkansas counties that were part of the delta."
10761,23,mississippi,10761,"Floods submerged the northwest of Mississippi in 1912-1913, causing heavy damage to the dyke districts."
10762,23,mississippi,10762,The regional losses and lobbying of the Mississippi River Levee Association for a flood control bill contributed to the passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local dykes districts on a 2:1 scale.
10763,23,mississippi,10763,"Although U.S. participation in the First World War interrupted the financing of the dikes, the second round of funding helped to raise the average height of the dikes in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to 22 feet (6.7 m) in the 1920s."
10764,23,mississippi,10764,Scientists now understand that dykes have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of floodplains.
10765,23,mississippi,10765,"The area was severely damaged due to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which crossed the dykes."
10766,23,mississippi,10766,"There have been losses of millions of dollars in goods, stocks and crops."
10767,23,mississippi,10767,"The greatest damage occurred in the lower delta, including Washington and Bolivar counties."
10768,23,mississippi,10768,"Although scientific knowledge on the Mississippi River has increased, upstream development and the consequences of the dams have caused more severe flooding in some years."
10769,23,mississippi,10769,Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and the construction of dykes have changed the nature of the river.
10770,23,mississippi,10770,"This work has eliminated the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, thereby strengthening the flow of the river."
10771,23,mississippi,10771,The federal and state governments have struggled for the best approaches to restoring certain natural habitats in order to better interact with the original river ecology.
10772,23,mississippi,10772,"Nearly 10,000 Native Americans or Paleo-Indians from British Columbia have arrived in what is now known as the South American."
10773,23,mississippi,10773,The southern Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that died after the late Pleistocene age.
10774,23,mississippi,10774,"In the Mississippi Delta, Amerindian colonies and agricultural fields were built on natural dikes, higher in the vicinity of rivers."
10775,23,mississippi,10775,The Amerindians have developed vast fields near their permanent villages.
10776,23,mississippi,10776,"Together with other practices, they created localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the Mississippi Delta as a whole."
10777,23,mississippi,10777,"After thousands of years, the successive cultures of the timber and Mississippi eras have developed rich and complex agricultural societies, in which the surplus has supported the development of specialized trades."
10778,23,mississippi,10778,Both were mound-builder cultures.
10779,23,mississippi,10779,"The Mississippi culture was the largest and most complex, built from about 950 AD."
10780,23,mississippi,10780,"The people had a commercial network covering the continent, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf coast."
10781,23,mississippi,10781,"Their large terraces, which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts, are still in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys."
10782,23,mississippi,10782,Amerindian tribes from Mississippi culture in the southeast include Chickasaw and Choctaw.
10783,23,mississippi,10783,"Other tribes that lived in Mississippi (and whose names were honoured by settlers in local cities) include Natchez, Yazoo and Biloxi."
10784,23,mississippi,10784,"The first major European expedition to the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who crossed the northeastern part of the state in 1540, during his second expedition to the New World."
10785,23,mississippi,10785,"In April 1699, French settlers established the first European colony at Fort Maurepas (also known as Old Biloxi), built near current ocean sources on the Gulf coast."
10786,23,mississippi,10786,It was established by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.
10787,23,mississippi,10787,"In 1716, the French founded Natchez on the Mississippi River (under the name of Fort Rosalie); it became the dominant city and trading post of the region."
10788,23,mississippi,10788,"The French called the largest territory ""New France""; the Spaniards continued to claim part of the Gulf Coast region (east of Mobile Bay) of the present-day southern Alabama, in addition to the entire area of Florida today."
10789,23,mississippi,10789,"In the 18th century, the region was governed by various Spanish, French and British colonial governments."
10790,23,mississippi,10790,The settlers imported African slaves as workers.
10791,23,mississippi,10791,"Under French and Spanish domination, there has been the development of a class of people free of colour (people of free colour), mainly multiracial descendants of European men and black women slaves or free, and their Métis children."
10792,23,mississippi,10792,"In the early days, French and Spanish settlers were mainly men."
10793,23,mississippi,10793,"While more and more European women have joined the colonies, men have race unions among women of African descent (and increasingly of multiracial descent), before and after the marriage of European women."
10794,23,mississippi,10794,"European men often help their multiracial children to educate themselves or to acquire apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settle on them; they often free mothers and their children if they are slaves, under placement contracts."
10795,23,mississippi,10795,"With this social capital, the people free of colour have become artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and real estate owners, forming a third class between Europeans and Africans the most slaves in the French and Spanish colonies, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana."
10796,23,mississippi,10796,"After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (seven-year war), the French handed over the Mississippi region to them under the Treaty of Paris (1763)."
10797,23,mississippi,10797,"They also divest their areas to the north, east of Mississippi, including Illinois and Quebec."
10798,23,mississippi,10798,"After the peace of Paris (1783), the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish domination as part of Western Florida."
10799,23,mississippi,10799,"In 1819, the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all East Florida in the Adams-Onís Treaty, and in 1822 the two were merged into Florida territory."
10800,23,mississippi,10800,"After the American Revolution (1765–83), Britain gave this region to the new United States of America."
10801,23,mississippi,10801,"The territory of Mississippi was organized on 7 April 1798, from the territory ceded by Georgia and South Carolina to the United States."
10802,23,mississippi,10802,Their original colonial charters extended theoretically westward to the Pacific Ocean.
10803,23,mississippi,10803,"Later, the territory of Mississippi was expanded twice to include the disputed territory claimed by the United States and Spain."
10804,23,mississippi,10804,"From about 1800 to 1830, the United States purchased land (Treaty of Doak's Stand) from Amerindian tribes for new colonies of European Americans."
10805,23,mississippi,10805,"The latter were mostly migrants from other southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were depleted."
10806,23,mississippi,10806,"New settlers were constantly encroaching on the lands of Choctaw, and they urged the federal government to expel the Amerindians."
10807,23,mississippi,10807,On 27 Sept. 1830 the treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the U.S. government and the Choctaw.
10808,23,mississippi,10808,The Choctaws agreed to sell their traditional lands in Mississippi and Alabama to obtain compensation and eliminate reserves in Indian territory (now Oklahoma).
10809,23,mississippi,10809,This opened up land for sale to the European-American migrant settlement.
10810,23,mississippi,10810,"Article 14 of the Treaty allows Choctaws who choose to remain in the states to become American citizens, as they are considered to abandon their tribal affiliation."
10811,23,mississippi,10811,"They were the second major American Aboriginal ethnic group to do so (some Cherokee were the first, who chose to stay in North Carolina and other areas instead of joining the abduction)."
10812,23,mississippi,10812,"Today, their descendants include about 9,500 people who identify themselves as Choctaw, and who live in Neshoba, Newton, Leake and Jones counties."
10813,23,mississippi,10813,The Mississippi Choctaw Indian Band was reorganized in the 20th century and is a tribe recognized by the federal government.
10814,23,mississippi,10814,"Many slave owners brought African-American slaves with them or bought them through the slave trade, particularly in New Orleans."
10815,23,mississippi,10815,"As a result of this trade, it is estimated that nearly a million slaves were forcibly transported to the deep South, including Mississippi, in an internal migration that broke many families of Upper South slaves, where planters were selling surplus slaves."
10816,23,mississippi,10816,Southerners imposed laws on slaves in the deep South and restricted the rights of free blacks.
10817,23,mississippi,10817,"From 1822 on, Mississippi slaves were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishments imposed by their owners."
10818,23,mississippi,10818,"In most cases, the slave codes of the South have made the deliberate killing of a slave illegal."
10819,23,mississippi,10819,"For example, in the Mississippi 1860 case, Oliver v. State accused the accused of killing his own slave."
10820,23,mississippi,10820,"Mississippi became the 20th state on December 10, 1817."
10821,23,mississippi,10821,David Holmes was the first governor.
10822,23,mississippi,10822,"The state was still occupied as ancestral land by several American Aboriginal tribes, including Choctaw, Natchez, Houma, Creek and Chickasaw."
10823,23,mississippi,10823,"Plantations were developed mainly along the main rivers, where the seafront provided access to the main transport routes."
10824,23,mississippi,10824,"It is also where the first cities develop, linked by steamboats that transport commercial products and crops to markets."
10825,23,mississippi,10825,"The rest of the Amerindian ancestral lands were not developed, but sold by treaty until 1826, when the Choctaws and Chickasaws refused to sell more land."
10826,23,mississippi,10826,"As a result of the abolition of the Choctaw Tribal Government by the Mississippi State Legislative Assembly in 1829, the Indian Abduction Act of President Andrew Jackson and the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty of 1830, the Choctaws were forced to sell their lands and were transported to Oklahoma territory."
10827,23,mississippi,10827,"The forced migration of the Choctaw, as well as other southeastern tribes abducted under the Act, became known as the Tears Trail."
10828,23,mississippi,10828,"When cotton was king in the 1850s, the owners of Mississippi plantations, especially those in the central Delta and black belt regions, became rich because of the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market and the free labour acquired thanks to their African-American enslavement outfit."
10829,23,mississippi,10829,They used part of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves.
10830,23,mississippi,10830,Planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labour and serious wealth imbalances among whites have played an important role in both state policy and in supporting planters for secession.
10831,23,mississippi,10831,Mississippi was a slave society whose economy depended on slavery.
10832,23,mississippi,10832,"The State was sparsely populated, with the population concentrated in riparian areas and cities."
10833,23,mississippi,10833,"In 1860, the enslaved Afro-American population numbered 436,631, or 55 per cent of the total State population, or 791,305 persons."
10834,23,mississippi,10834,"Less than 1,000 people were free of colour."
10835,23,mississippi,10835,"The relatively small population of the State prior to the civil war reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the banks of the river, which formed the main transport corridors."
10836,23,mississippi,10836,Ninety per cent of the delta's bottom land was still at the border and undeveloped.
10837,23,mississippi,10837,The State needs much more settlers for development.
10838,23,mississippi,10838,The lands farther from the rivers were cleared by liberated men and white migrants during reconstruction and later.
10839,23,mississippi,10839,"On January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the Union, and was one of the founding members of the Confederate States."
10840,23,mississippi,10840,The first six states to separate were those that had the largest number of slaves.
10841,23,mississippi,10841,"During the war, the forces of the Union and Confederation fought for domination over the Mississippi River, critical for supply routes and trade."
10842,23,mississippi,10842,"More than 80,000 Mississippians fought during the civil war, and the losses were extremely heavy."
10843,23,mississippi,10843,The long siege of Vicksburg of the General Union Ulysse S. Grant finally gained control of the Union of the River in 1863.
10844,23,mississippi,10844,"In the post-war period, liberated men withdrew from white churches to create independent congregations."
10845,23,mississippi,10845,"The majority of blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, greatly reducing its membership."
10846,23,mississippi,10846,They created independent black Baptist congregations.
10847,23,mississippi,10847,"In 1895, they had established numerous associations of black Baptist states and the National Baptist Convention of Black Churches."
10848,23,mississippi,10848,"In addition, independent black denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church (founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 19th century) and the African Methodist Episcopal Church (founded in New York), sent missionaries to the South in the post-war years."
10849,23,mississippi,10849,They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South.
10850,23,mississippi,10850,The congregations of the South also brought their own influences to these confessions.
10851,23,mississippi,10851,"During the reconstruction, Mississippi's first constitutional convention in 1868, with both black and white delegates, formed a constitution whose main elements would be maintained for 22 years."
10852,23,mississippi,10852,"The convention was the first political organization of the state to include African-American representatives, 17 of the 100 members (32 counties had black majorities at the time)."
10853,23,mississippi,10853,"Some of the black delegates were liberated men, but others were educated by free blacks who had emigrated from the North."
10854,23,mississippi,10854,"The Convention had adopted universal suffrage; removed titles to vote or office, a change that had also benefited both blacks and poor whites; provided for the first State system of public schools; prohibited racial distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited the limitation of civil rights in travel."
10855,23,mississippi,10855,"As part of the reconstruction, Mississippi was restored to the Union on 23 February 1870."
10856,23,mississippi,10856,"Because the Mississippi Delta contained so much fertile land that had not been developed before the civil war, 90 per cent of the land was still at the border."
10857,23,mississippi,10857,"After the civil war, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land."
10858,23,mississippi,10858,"In addition, black and white workers could make money by clearing land and selling timber, and possibly making advances to property."
10859,23,mississippi,10859,"New farmers included many liberated men who, by the end of the 19th century, had reached abnormally high rates of land ownership in Mississippi bottom lands."
10860,23,mississippi,10860,"In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in acquiring land."
10861,23,mississippi,10861,"By the beginning of the 20th century, two thirds of Mississippi farmers who owned land in the delta were American Africans."
10862,23,mississippi,10862,But many had become too indebted during the fall in cotton prices in the difficult years of the late 19th century.
10863,23,mississippi,10863,Cotton prices have fallen in the decades since the civil war.
10864,23,mississippi,10864,"As another agricultural depression caused cotton prices to fall in the 1890s, many African-American farmers eventually had to sell their land to repay their debts, thereby losing the land they had developed through hard and personal labor."
10865,23,mississippi,10865,"The Democrats had regained control of the state legislature in 1875, after a year of increased violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was known as the ""white line"" campaign, based on the affirmation of white supremacy."
10866,23,mississippi,10866,The White Democrats were well armed and formed paramilitary organizations such as the Red Shirts to suppress the black vote.
10867,23,mississippi,10867,"From 1874 to the election of 1875, they pressure the whites to join the Democrats and lead violence against the blacks in at least 15 known riots in cities around the state to intimidate the blacks."
10868,23,mississippi,10868,"They killed a total of 150 Blacks, although other estimates place the number of deaths twice as many."
10869,23,mississippi,10869,A total of three white Republicans and five white Democrats were reportedly killed.
10870,23,mississippi,10870,"In rural areas, Black deaths could be covered."
10871,23,mississippi,10871,"Riots (better described as black massacres) took place in Vicksburg, Clinton, Macon, and in their counties, well-armed whites broke black meetings and lynched known black leaders, destroying local political organizations."
10872,23,mississippi,10872,"Seeing the success of this deliberate ""Mississippi Plan"", South Carolina and other states followed it and also obtained white democratic domination."
10873,23,mississippi,10873,"In 1877, by a national compromise, the last federal troops were withdrawn from the region."
10874,23,mississippi,10874,"Even in this environment, Black Mississippians continue to be elected to local positions."

11225,24,missouri,11225,"This seems to be popular etymology — Illinois spoke an Algonquian language and the closest approximation that can be made in that of their close neighbours, the Ojibwe, is ""You should go down and visit these people."""
11226,24,missouri,11226,"This would be a strange event, because the French who first explored and tried to settle in Mississippi generally obtained their translations during this fairly precise period, often giving things French names that were exact translations of the mother tongue(s)."
11227,24,missouri,11227,"Assuming that Missouri derives from the Siwan language, it translates as ""it connects to its side"", with reference to the river itself."
11228,24,missouri,11228,"It's not quite probable either, because it would be going out like ""Maya Sunni"" (Mah-yah soo-nee)."

11233,24,missouri,11233,"In English, the pronunciation was received, the preferred variant is miz-OR-ee, the setting-OR-ee being a possible alternative."
11234,24,missouri,11234,"Language history was definitely dealt with by Donald M. Lance, who acknowledged that the issue was sociologically complex, but no pronunciation could be declared ""correct"", nor clearly defined as native or external, rural or urban, southern or northern, educated or not."

11238,24,missouri,11238,"However, Missouri's unofficial nickname is ""Show Me State"", which appears on its license plates."
11239,24,missouri,11239,This sentence has several origins.
11240,24,missouri,11240,"One of them is largely attributed to a speech by MP Willard Vandiver in 1899, who declared that ""I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and democrats, and the sparkling eloquence does not convince me or satisfy me."
11241,24,missouri,11241,"I'm from Missouri, and you have to show me."""
11242,24,missouri,11242,"It's in agreement with the saying ""I'm from Missouri,"" which means ""I'm sceptical about the issue and not easily convinced."""
11243,24,missouri,11243,"However, according to the researchers, the term ""show me"" was already used before the 1890s."
11244,24,missouri,11244,Another indicates that this is a reference to the Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville (Colorado) to replace the workers on strike.
11245,24,missouri,11245,"Since the new men were not familiar with mining methods, they needed frequent instruction."
11246,24,missouri,11246,"Other nicknames for Missouri include ""the Head State"", ""the State of Bullion"", ""the State of Ozark"", ""the Mother of the West"", ""the State of the Iron Mountain"", and ""Western Pennsylvania""."
11247,24,missouri,11247,"It is also known as the ""State of the Cave"" because there are more than 7,300 caves registered in the state (second in Tennessee)."

11249,24,missouri,11249,"The official motto of the state is Latin: ""Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto"", meaning ""Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law""."

11251,24,missouri,11251,"Archaeological excavations along the rivers have shown a continuous habitation for more than 7,000 years."
11252,24,missouri,11252,"Beginning in the year 1000, there was the complex culture of Mississippi, whose people created regional political centres at present, Saint-Louis, and on the other side of the Mississippi River, at Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois."
11253,24,missouri,11253,Their large cities included thousands of individual residences.
11254,24,missouri,11254,"Yet they are known for their massive earth-moving mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platform, summit and conical form."

11256,24,missouri,11256,"Civilization declined by 1400, and most descendants left the region long before the arrival of Europeans."
11257,24,missouri,11257,Saint-Louis was at a time known as Mound City by American Europeans because of the many prehistoric mounds that have survived since lost for urban development.
11258,24,missouri,11258,"Mississippi culture left mounds in the mid-missippi and Ohio valleys, extending to the southeast and upper rivers."
11259,24,missouri,11259,The land that became the state of Missouri was part of many different territories had changing and often indeterminate borders and had many different Amerindian and European names between the 1600s and state status.
11260,24,missouri,11260,"For most of the first half of the 1700s, the western shore of Mississippi, which was to become Missouri, was largely uninhabited, a land of no man who kept peace between Illinois on the east shore of Mississippi and north, and Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley."
11261,24,missouri,11261,"In the early 1700s, French merchants and missionaries explored the entire Mississippi Valley, known as the Louisiana region.At the same time, a different group of French Canadians who established five villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River placed their colonies in Illinois, Illinois."
11262,24,missouri,11262,"Genevieve, they continued to place their institutions in Illinois."
11263,24,missouri,11263,"At the same time, the French colonies on both sides of Mississippi were part of the French province of Louisiana."
11264,24,missouri,11264,"To distinguish the colonies of the Middle Mississippi Valley from the French colonies of the Lower Mississippi Valley around New Orleans, French officials and residents called the Middle Mississippi Valley the Upper Louisiana, Upper Louisiana, or Upper Louisiana."
11265,24,missouri,11265,"The first European settlers were mostly French-Canadians, who created their first colony in Missouri at the present time in Ste."
11266,24,missouri,11266,"Geneviève, about an hour south of Saint-Louis."
11267,24,missouri,11267,They had migrated around 1750 from Illinois.
11268,24,missouri,11268,"They came from colonial villages on the east side of Mississippi, where soils were becoming depleted, and there was not enough ground for the growing population."
11269,24,missouri,11269,"The early colonies of Missouri included many African and Amerindian slaves, and slave labour was at the heart of commercial agriculture and the fur trade."
11270,24,missouri,11270,"Sainte-Geneviève has become a prosperous agricultural centre, producing enough wheat, corn and excess tobacco to ship tonnes of grain annually to Lower Louisiana for trade."
11271,24,missouri,11271,Grain production in Illinois was essential to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.
11272,24,missouri,11272,Saint-Louis was founded shortly afterwards by Pierre Laclède and the son-in-law Auguste Chouteau of New Orleans in 1764.
11273,24,missouri,11273,"From 1764 to 1803, European control of the region west of Mississippi to the northernmost part of the Missouri basin, known as Louisiana, was assumed by the Spaniards as part of the vice-royalty of New Spain, due to the Treaty of Fontainebleau (in order for Spain to join France in the war against England)."
11274,24,missouri,11274,The Spaniards' arrival at Saint-Louis took place in September 1767.
11275,24,missouri,11275,"Saint-Louis became the centre of a regional fur trade with the Amerindian tribes that expanded the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, which dominated the regional economy for decades."
11276,24,missouri,11276,The trading partners of the large companies shipped their furs from Saint-Louis through the river to New Orleans to export them to Europe.
11277,24,missouri,11277,They provided a variety of goods to traders for sale and trade with their Amerindian customers.
11278,24,missouri,11278,The fur trade and associated companies have made St. Louis an early financial centre and have provided wealth for some to build beautiful houses and import luxury items.
11279,24,missouri,11279,Its location near the Illinois confluence meant that it also treated products from agricultural areas.
11280,24,missouri,11280,Traffic and river trade along Mississippi are an integral part of the state economy.
11281,24,missouri,11281,"As the first major city in the region, Saint-Louis expanded considerably after the invention of the steamboat and the increase in river trade."
11282,24,missouri,11282,Napoleon Bonaparte had acquired Louisiana for the French property of Spain in 1800 under the treaty of San Ildefonso after it had been a Spanish colony since 1762.
11283,24,missouri,11283,But the treaty was kept secret.
11284,24,missouri,11284,"Louisiana remained nominally under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France on 30 November 1803, just three weeks before the transfer to the United States."
11285,24,missouri,11285,"Part of the purchase of Louisiana by the United States in 1803, the Missouri won the Western Gateway nickname because it served as an important starting point for expeditions and settlers heading west during the 19th century."
11286,24,missouri,11286,"Saint-Charles, just west of Saint-Louis, was the starting point and return destination of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which climbed on the Missouri River in 1804, to explore the lands from the west to the Pacific Ocean."
11287,24,missouri,11287,St. Louis has been an important supply point for decades for settler parties heading west.
11288,24,missouri,11288,"As many early settlers from Western Missouri emigrated from the Upper South, they brought African-American slaves as agricultural workers, and they wanted to continue their culture and the institution of slavery."
11289,24,missouri,11289,"They settled mainly in 17 counties along Missouri, in an area of plains that allowed plantation farming and became known as ""Little Dixie""."
11290,24,missouri,11290,The state was shaken by earthquakes from 1811 to 1812.
11291,24,missouri,11291,There have been few losses due to the scarcity of the population.
11292,24,missouri,11292,"In 1821, the former territory of Missouri was admitted as a slave state, under the compromise of Missouri, and with a temporary state capital in Saint Charles."
11293,24,missouri,11293,"In 1826, the capital was moved to its current permanent location in Jefferson City, also on the Missouri River."
11294,24,missouri,11294,"Originally, the western boundary of the state was a straight line, defined as the meridian passing through Kawsmouth, the point where the Kansas River enters the Missouri River."
11295,24,missouri,11295,The river has moved since that designation.
11296,24,missouri,11296,This line is known as the Osage border.
11297,24,missouri,11297,"In 1836 the purchase of the Platte was added to the northwest corner of the state after the purchase of the lands of the native tribes, making the Missouri River the border north of the Kansas River."
11298,24,missouri,11298,"This addition increased the area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to the 65,000 square miles of Virginia, which then included Western Virginia)."
11299,24,missouri,11299,"In the early 1830s, Mormon migrants from northern states and Canada began to settle near independence and just north of the island."
11300,24,missouri,11300,"Conflicts over religion and slavery have arisen between the ""former settlers"" (mainly from the South) and the Mormons (mainly from the North)."
11301,24,missouri,11301,The War of Mormon broke out in 1838.
11302,24,missouri,11302,"In 1839, with the help of a ""order of extermination"" of Governor Lilburn Boggs, the former settlers forcibly expelled the Mormons of Missouri and confiscated their lands."
11303,24,missouri,11303,Slavery-related conflicts exacerbated border tensions between States and territories.
11304,24,missouri,11304,"From 1838 to 1839, a border dispute with Iowa over the so-called Honey Lands led to the initiation by the two militia states along the border."
11305,24,missouri,11305,"With the increase in migration from 1830 to 1860, the Missouri population almost doubled every decade."
11306,24,missouri,11306,"Most newcomers were born in the United States, but many Irish and German immigrants arrived in the late 1840s and 1850s."
11307,24,missouri,11307,"As the majority were Catholic, they established their own religious institutions in the state, which had been mostly Protestant."
11308,24,missouri,11308,"Many settled in cities, creating a regional network and then a state network of Catholic churches and schools."
11309,24,missouri,11309,The 19th-century German immigrants created the wine industry along Missouri and the beer industry in Saint-Louis.
11310,24,missouri,11310,"While many German immigrants were strongly anti-slavery, many Irish immigrants living in cities were pro-slavery, fearing that the liberation of African-American slaves would create a mass of unskilled labour, reducing wages."
11311,24,missouri,11311,Most Missouri farmers were engaged in subsistence farming before the American Civil War.
11312,24,missouri,11312,The majority of those who were slaves had fewer than five people each.
11313,24,missouri,11313,"Planters, defined by some historians as having about 20 or more slaves, were concentrated in the counties known as ""Little Dixie"" in the central part of the state along the Missouri River."
11314,24,missouri,11314,Tensions about slavery relate primarily to the future of the State and the nation.
11315,24,missouri,11315,"In 1860, Afro-American enslaved persons accounted for less than 10 per cent of the state population, or 1,182,012."
11316,24,missouri,11316,"To control the flooding of agricultural land and low-lying villages along Mississippi, the state had completed the construction of 230 kilometres of dikes along the river in 1860."
11317,24,missouri,11317,"After the secession of the southern states began in 1861, the parliament of Missouri called for the election of a special convention on secession."
11318,24,missouri,11318,Pro-South Governor Claiborne F. Jackson ordered the mobilization of several hundred members of the state militia who had gathered in a camp in Saint-Louis to train.
11319,24,missouri,11319,"Alarmed by this action, the General Union Nathaniel Lyon strikes first, encircling the camp and forcing the troops of the state to surrender."
11320,24,missouri,11320,"Lyon led his soldiers, largely non-English-speaking German immigrants, to walk the prisoners in the streets, and opened fire on the widely hostile crowds of civilians who gathered around them."
11321,24,missouri,11321,"Soldiers killed unarmed prisoners as well as men, women and children of Saint-Louis in the incident that became known as the ""Saint-Louis Massacre""."
11322,24,missouri,11322,These events have strengthened the confederate support within the state.
11323,24,missouri,11323,"Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price, president of the Secession Convention, to head the new Missouri State Guard."
11324,24,missouri,11324,"In the face of the rapid advance of the Lyon General Union across the state, Jackson and Price were forced to flee the capital of Jefferson City on 14 June 1861."
11325,24,missouri,11325,"In Neosho, Missouri, Jackson summoned the state legislature to seek secession."
11326,24,missouri,11326,"However, the elected legislative body was divided between pro-Union and pro-Confederate."
11327,24,missouri,11327,"As such, few pro-unionists attended the session called in Neosho, and the secession order was quickly adopted."
11328,24,missouri,11328,"Confederation recognized the secession of Missouri on October 30, 1861."
11329,24,missouri,11329,"With the elected governor absent from the capital and the widely dispersed legislators, the state convention was convened with most of its members present, except twenty who fled south with Jackson's forces."
11330,24,missouri,11330,The convention declared all offices vacant and installed Hamilton Gamble as the new Governor of Missouri.
11331,24,missouri,11331,President Lincoln's administration immediately recognized Gamble's government as the legal Missouri government.
11332,24,missouri,11332,The federal government's decision has allowed for an increase in the pro-Union militia forces for service within the state and voluntary regiments for the Union Army.
11333,24,missouri,11333,Fighting took place between the Union forces and a combined army of the Missouri State Guard of General Price and Confederate troops of Arkansas and Texas under the leadership of General Ben McCulloch.
11334,24,missouri,11334,"After winning victories at the Battle of Wilson's Creek and the siege of Lexington, Missouri and suffering losses elsewhere, the Confederate forces retreated to Arkansas and later Marshall, Texas, against a largely strengthened Union army."
11335,24,missouri,11335,"Although regular Confederate troops organized large-scale raids in Missouri, fighting in the state for the next three years consisted mainly of guerrillas."
11336,24,missouri,11336,"""Citizen soldiers"" or insurgents such as Captain William Quantrill, Frank and Jesse James, brothers Younger and William T. Anderson used quick tactics and small units."
11337,24,missouri,11337,"Initiated by the Rangers of the Missouri Partisan, these insurrections also arose in parts of the Confederation occupied by the Union during the civil war."
11338,24,missouri,11338,"Historians have portrayed the stories of the outlaw years of the James brothers as an American myth ""Robin Hood""."
11339,24,missouri,11339,"Knobbers Bald of the Ozarks in the 1880s were an unofficial continuation of the insurgent mentality long after the official end of the war, and they are a favorite theme in Branson's image."
11340,24,missouri,11340,"The progressive era (1890-1920) saw many prominent leaders of Missouri trying to end corruption and modernize politics, government and society."
11341,24,missouri,11341,"Joseph ""Saint Joe"" Folk was a key leader who made a strong appeal to the middle class and evangelical rural Protestants."
11342,24,missouri,11342,Folk was elected governor as a reformer and progressive democrat in the 1904 election.
11343,24,missouri,11343,"He promoted what he called ""the idea of Missouri"", the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of the law and strict enforcement."
11344,24,missouri,11344,"He successfully pursued antitrust prosecutions, stopped free railway passes for state officials, expanded corruption laws, improved electoral laws, demanded official registration of lobbyists, made the race track game illegal and enforced Sunday's closing law."
11345,24,missouri,11345,"It has contributed to the adoption of progressive laws, including a referendum initiative and provision, electoral regulation, education, employment and child labour, railways, food, businesses and public services."
11346,24,missouri,11346,"Several efficiency boards and reviewers' commissions were established during the administration of the Folk, including many agricultural boards and the Missouri Library Commission."
11347,24,missouri,11347,"Between the civil war and the end of the Second World War, Missouri moved from a rural economy to a hybrid industrial-service-agricultural economy like the rapidly industrialized Midwest."
11348,24,missouri,11348,The expansion of the railways to the west has transformed the city of Kansas into an important transportation centre within the nation.
11349,24,missouri,11349,"The growth of the Texas cattle industry, as well as the increase in railway infrastructure and the invention of the cold car, also made Kansas City an important meat packaging centre, while Texas's large cattle roads brought livestock herds to Dodge City and other Kansas cities."
11350,24,missouri,11350,"There, the cattle were loaded into trains destined for Kansas City, where they were massacred and distributed to the eastern markets."
11351,24,missouri,11351,"The first half of the 20th century was the height of the city of Kansas, and its city centre became a showcase for elegant Art Deco skyscrapers as construction boomed."
11352,24,missouri,11352,"In 1930, there was an epidemic of diphtheria in the Springfield area, which killed about 100 people."
11353,24,missouri,11353,"Serum was rushed into the area, and medical personnel stopped the epidemic."
11354,24,missouri,11354,"In the mid-1950s and 1960s, St. Louis and Kansas City experienced deindustrialization and job losses in railways and manufacturing, as did other industrial cities in the Midwest."
11355,24,missouri,11355,"In 1956, St. Charles claimed to be the site of the first interstate highway project."

11677,25,montana,11677,The Rocky Mountain Front is an important feature of the north-central part of the state and of isolated island chains that interrupt the common prairie landscape in the central and eastern parts of the state.
11678,25,montana,11678,"About 60 per cent of the state is a prairie, which is part of the northern Great Plains."
11679,25,montana,11679,"The Bitterroot Mountains, one of the longest continuous chains of the Alaskan Rocky Mountains in Mexico, as well as the Alene Heart Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the state of Idaho."

11683,25,montana,11683,"The front is the most prominent in the Lewis Range, located primarily in Glacier National Park."
11684,25,montana,11684,"Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (which begins on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska) crosses this area and turns east into Montana at Triple Divide Peak."

11699,25,montana,11699,The underlying surface consists of sandstone and shale.
11700,25,montana,11700,"The area's surface soils are very diverse and heavily affected by local geology, be they glazed plains, intermountain basins, mountain foothills or plateaus."
11701,25,montana,11701,"The areas of the foothills are often covered with broken stones or slates or bare rocks discovered (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone or shale)."
11702,25,montana,11702,"The soil of the intermountainous basins generally consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt and volcanic ash, much of which is made up of lakes that covered the area during the oligocene 33-23 million years ago."
11703,25,montana,11703,"The trays are often surmounted by argillite gravel and worn quartzite, sometimes under the shale."

11766,25,montana,11766,"Montana is a large state with considerable variations in geography, topography and altitude, and the climate is therefore also varied."
11767,25,montana,11767,"The state extends from the 45th parallel (the equidistant line between the equator and the North Pole) to the 49th parallel, with altitudes ranging from less than 2,000 feet (610 m) to nearly 13,000 feet (4,000 m) above sea level."

11769,25,montana,11769,"The eastern Montana includes plains and badlands, broken by isolated hills and mountain ranges, and has a semi-arid and continental climate (Köppen BSk climate classification)."
11770,25,montana,11770,"The continental divide has a considerable effect on the climate, as it limits the warmer air flow in the Pacific from the east and the drier continental air from the west."
11771,25,montana,11771,"The area west of the ditch has a modified climate in the north of the Pacific coast, with milder winters, cooler summers, less wind and a longer growing season."
11772,25,montana,11772,"Low clouds and fog often form in the valleys west of the division in winter, but it is rarely seen to the east."
11773,25,montana,11773,Average daily temperatures vary from 28°F or -2.2°C in January to 84.5°F or 29.2°C in July.
11774,25,montana,11774,The variation in geography leads to a large variation in temperature.
11775,25,montana,11775,"The highest summer temperature was 117°F or 47.2°C at Glendive on July 20, 1893, and at Medicine Lake on July 5, 1937."

11781,25,montana,11781,"Temperatures vary considerably on cold nights, and Helena, at 64 km to the southeast, reached only -36°F or -37.8°C on the same date, and reached a record level of -42°F or -41.1°C."
11782,25,montana,11782,Winter cold spells are usually the result of cold continental air coming from southern Canada.
11783,25,montana,11783,"The front is often well defined, resulting in a sharp drop in temperature in 24 hours."
11784,25,montana,11784,"Conversely, the southwest airflow translates into ""chinooks""."
11785,25,montana,11785,"These stable winds from 25 to 50 mph (40 to 80 km/h) (or more) can suddenly warm up parts of Montana, especially areas just east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise to 50 to 60 degrees F (10 to 15.6 degrees Celsius) for 10 days or more."
11786,25,montana,11786,Loma is the site of the most extreme temperature change recorded over a 24-hour period in the United States.
11787,25,montana,11787,"On 15 January 1972, a chinook wind blew and the temperature increased from -54°F to 49°F (−47.8°C to 9.4°C)."
11788,25,montana,11788,"Average annual precipitation is 15 inches (380 mm), but large variations are observed."
11789,25,montana,11789,"The mountain ranges block the damp air of the Pacific, holding moisture in the western valleys and creating rain shadows to the east."

11791,25,montana,11791,"On the east side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine has an average of 11.45 inches (291 mm) and Deer Lodge of 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation."
11792,25,montana,11792,"The mountains can receive more than 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the glacier Grinnell in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches (2,700 mm)."
11793,25,montana,11793,An area southwest of Belfry averaged 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a 16-year period.

11799,25,montana,11799,"Many cities in Montana recorded heat records in July 2007, the warmest month ever recorded in Montana."
11800,25,montana,11800,Winters are also warmer and have fewer cold spells.
11801,25,montana,11801,"Previously, these cold spells had killed the beetles, but they are now attacking forests in western Montana."
11802,25,montana,11802,The warmer winters in the area allowed various species to expand their range and proliferate.
11803,25,montana,11803,"The combination of warmer weather, beetle attack and poor management has resulted in a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana."
11804,25,montana,11804,"According to a study by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some parts of Montana will experience a 200% increase in forest fire burning and an 80% increase in related air pollution."
11805,25,montana,11805,The table below shows the average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month of the seven largest cities in Montana.
11806,25,montana,11806,"The coldest month varies between December and January depending on the location, although the figures are generally similar."
11807,25,montana,11807,Montana is one of only two contiguous states (with Colorado) that are antipodal on land.
11808,25,montana,11808,The Kerguelen Islands are antipodal at the Montana/Saskatchewan/Alberta border.
11809,25,montana,11809,"No city is precisely antipodal in Kerguelen, although Chester and Rudyard are close."
11810,25,montana,11810,Various indigenous peoples have lived in the territory of the present State of Montana for thousands of years.
11811,25,montana,11811,"Historical tribes encountered by Europeans and settlers in the United States included the Crow in south-central, Cheyenne in the very southeast, Blackfeet, Assiniboine and Gros Ventres in the centre and north-central, and Kootenai and Salish in the west."
11812,25,montana,11812,"The smallest Pend d'Oreille and Kalispel tribes lived near Flathead Lake and the western mountains, respectively."
11813,25,montana,11813,A portion of southeastern Montana was used as a corridor between Crows and related Hidata in North Dakota.
11814,25,montana,11814,The lands of Montana to the east of the continental division were part of the purchase of Louisiana in 1803.
11815,25,montana,11815,"Subsequently, and particularly in the decades following the Lewis and Clark expeditions, American, British and French traders operated a fur trade, usually working with Aboriginal peoples, both in the east and west of what would become Montana."
11816,25,montana,11816,"These transactions have not always been peaceful, and although the fur trade has brought material gain to indigenous tribal groups, it has also led to exposure to European diseases and has changed their economic and cultural traditions."
11817,25,montana,11817,The trading post Fort Raymond (1807–11) was built in the Indian country of Crow in 1807.
11818,25,montana,11818,"Until the Oregon Treaty (1846), the lands west of the continental division were disputed between the British and the United States and were known as Oregon countries."
11819,25,montana,11819,The first permanent establishment by the Euro-Americans in what is today Montana was St. Mary's (1841) near Stevensville today.
11820,25,montana,11820,In 1847 Fort Benton became the highest fur trade post on the Missouri River.
11821,25,montana,11821,"In the 1850s, settlers began to settle in the Beaverhead and Big Hole valleys from the Oregon Trail and the Clark Fork Valley."
11822,25,montana,11822,"The first gold discovered in Montana was at Gold Creek, near the present garrison in 1852."
11823,25,montana,11823,"A series of major mining discoveries in the western third of the state from 1862 onward found gold, silver, copper, lead and coal (and later oil) that attracted tens of thousands of miners to the area."
11824,25,montana,11824,"The richest of all gold-placer digs was discovered in Alder Gulch, where the city of Virginia City was established."
11825,25,montana,11825,"Other rich depots have been found in Last Chance Gulch, where the city of Helen, Confeder Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City is now located."
11826,25,montana,11826,Gold production from 1862 to 1876 reached $144 million
11827,25,montana,11827,"The largest mining operations were in the city of Butte, which had large deposits of silver and huge copper deposits."
11828,25,montana,11828,"Prior to the creation of the Montana Territory (1864–89), the current Montana regions were part of Oregon (1848–59), Washington (1853–63), Idaho (1863–64) and Dakota (1861–64)."
11829,25,montana,11829,Montana became a territory of the United States (Montana Territory) on 26 May 1864.

11835,25,montana,11835,"In 1869 and 1870, respectively, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson and Washburn–Langford–Doane expeditions were launched from Helen into the Upper Yellowstone area and led directly to the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
11836,25,montana,11836,"As settlers began to populate Montana from the 1850s to the 1870s, disputes ensued with the Amerindians, mainly over land ownership and control."
11837,25,montana,11837,"In 1855, the territorial governor of Washington, Isaac Stevens, negotiated the Hellgate Treaty between the U.S. government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille and the Kootenai of western Montana, which established boundaries for tribal nations."
11838,25,montana,11838,The treaty was ratified in 1859.
11839,25,montana,11839,"While the treaty established what would later become the Flathead Indian Reserve, difficulty with the interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led the whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley had been opened to colonization, but the tribal nations challenged those provisions."
11840,25,montana,11840,The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.
11841,25,montana,11841,"The first U.S. Army post in Montana was Camp Cooke in 1866, on the Missouri River, to protect the traffic of steamboats travelling to Fort Benton."
11842,25,montana,11842,More than a dozen additional military outposts have been established in the state.
11843,25,montana,11843,Pressure on land ownership and control has increased as a result of gold discoveries in various parts of Montana and surrounding states.
11844,25,montana,11844,"Major battles took place in Montana during the Red Cloud War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, the Nez Perce War and in the conflicts with Piegan Blackfeet."

11846,25,montana,11846,The last conflict in Montana between the American army and the Amerindians occurred in 1887 during the Battle of Crow Agency in Big Horn's country.
11847,25,montana,11847,Indian survivors who have signed treaties are generally required to make reservations.
11848,25,montana,11848,"Along with these conflicts, bison, a key species, and the main source of proteins on which Aboriginal people had survived for centuries, were destroyed."
11849,25,montana,11849,It is estimated that more than 13 million bison were in Montana in 1870.
11850,25,montana,11850,"In 1875, General Philip Sheridan pleaded for a joint Congressional session to authorize the slaughter of herds in order to deprive the Indians of their food source."

11852,25,montana,11852,Cattle farming has been at the heart of Montana's history and economy since Johnny Grant began wintering cattle in the Deer Lodge Valley in the 1850s and exchanged fattened cattle in fertile Montana valleys with emigrants on the Oregon Trail.

11856,25,montana,11856,"Operated by the National Parks Service, it is a 1,900-acre ranch (7.7 km2)."
11857,25,montana,11857,The North Pacific Railway (NPR) tracks reached Montana from the west in 1881 and from the east in 1882.
11858,25,montana,11858,"However, the railway played a major role in tensions with Amerindian tribes in the 1870s."
11859,25,montana,11859,"Jay Cooke, president of the NPR, launched important surveys in the Yellowstone Valley in 1871, 1872 and 1873, which the Sioux strongly challenged under the leadership of Chief Sitting Bull."
11860,25,montana,11860,"These clashes, in part, contributed to the panic of 1873, a financial crisis that delayed the construction of the railway in Montana."
11861,25,montana,11861,"Surveys conducted in 1874, 1875 and 1876 helped trigger the Great Sioux War of 1876."

11863,25,montana,11863,"The Northern Grand Railway (NRG) tracks reached eastern Montana in 1887 and when they reached northern Rocky Mountains in 1890, the NRG became a major tourism promoter in the Glacier National Park area."
11864,25,montana,11864,"The transcontinental GNR was completed on January 6, 1893 at Scenic, Washington State."
11865,25,montana,11865,"In 1881, the Utah and Northern Railway, a branch of the Union Pacific, completed a narrow track line from northern Utah to Butte."

11868,25,montana,11868,"A second constitutional convention, held in Helena in 1884, produced a constitution ratified by the citizens of Montana in November 1884."
11869,25,montana,11869,"For political reasons, Congress only approved state status in Montana in February 1889, and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting state status in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington after the appropriate state constitutions had been drafted."
11870,25,montana,11870,In July 1889 the Montanans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution accepted by the people and the federal government.

11874,25,montana,11874,"The Homestead Act of 1862 provided free land for settlers who could claim and ""proven"" 160 acres (0.65 km2) of federal land in the Midwest and western United States."
11875,25,montana,11875,Montana did not see a significant influx of immigrants under the Act because 160 acres were generally insufficient to support a family in arid territory.
11876,25,montana,11876,"In 1868 David Carpenter, near Helen, made the first claim under the Montana law."
11877,25,montana,11877,"A woman's first claim was made near Warm Springs Creek by Gwenllian Evans, the daughter of Deer Lodge Montana's pioneer, Morgan Evans."
11878,25,montana,11878,"In 1880, the farms were in the greenest valleys of central and western Montana, but few were in the eastern plains."
11879,25,montana,11879,The Desert Lands Act of 1877 was adopted to permit the settlement of dry lands in the west and awarded 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a $25 per acre price and a promise of irrigation.
11880,25,montana,11880,"After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would be the property of the colon."
11881,25,montana,11881,"This law brought most cattle and sheep breeders to Montana, many of whom have pricked their herds into the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land, and then abandoned it without paying the last fee."
11882,25,montana,11882,"Some farmers arrived with the arrival of the Northern and Northern Pacific Great Railways in the 1880s and 1890s, but in relatively small numbers."
11883,25,montana,11883,"In the early 1900s James J. Hill, from the far north, began to promote the settlement on the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods."
11884,25,montana,11884,Other railways followed.
11885,25,montana,11885,"In 1902, the Rehabilitation Act was passed, allowing for the construction of irrigation projects in the eastern river valleys of Montana."
11886,25,montana,11886,"In 1909, Congress passed the Extended Houses Act, which extended the area of open land from 160 acres to 320 acres (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family, and in 1912 reduced the time to ""proven"" a claim to three years."
11887,25,montana,11887,"In 1916, the Inventory Housing Act allowed 640 acres of houses in areas unsuitable for irrigation."
11888,25,montana,11888,"This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act attracted tens of thousands of landowners, attracted to free land, with the First World War bringing particularly high wheat prices."
11889,25,montana,11889,"In addition, Montana was experiencing a temporary period of higher than average precipitation."
11890,25,montana,11890,"The owners arriving at this time were known as ""Honyockers"", or ""scissors""."
11891,25,montana,11891,"Although the word ""honyocker"", perhaps derived from the ethnic slur ""hunyak"", was applied in a derisory manner to the owners as ""green horns"", ""new to his business"", or ""unprepared"", most of these new settlers had agricultural experience, although many did not."
11892,25,montana,11892,"However, farmers face a number of problems."
11893,25,montana,11893,Massive debt was one.
11894,25,montana,11894,"In addition, most settlers came from wetter areas, were not prepared for dry climate, lack of trees and scarcity of water resources."
11895,25,montana,11895,"In addition, small homes less than 320 acres (130 ha) were not suitable for the environment."
11896,25,montana,11896,Weather and agricultural conditions are much harsher and drier west of the 100th meridian.
11897,25,montana,11897,"Then, the droughts of 1917-1921 proved devastating."
11898,25,montana,11898,"Many people left, and half of the state's banks went bankrupt by providing mortgages that could not be repaid."
11899,25,montana,11899,"As a result, the size of holdings has increased, while the number of holdings has decreased."
11900,25,montana,11900,"In 1910, the owners filed claims on more than five million acres, and in 1923, more than 93 million acres were cultivated."
11901,25,montana,11901,"By 1910, the Great Falls Land Office alone had more than a thousand deposits of property per month, and at the top of 1917-1918, it had 14,000 deposits per year."
11902,25,montana,11902,Significant declines occurred as a result of the 1919 drought.

11905,25,montana,11905,"In 1917–18, due to a miscalculation of the population of Montana, approximately 40,000 Montanans, 10% of the population of the state, volunteered or were recruited into the armed forces."
11906,25,montana,11906,It was a contribution of labour to war that was 25 per cent higher than that of any other per capita state.
11907,25,montana,11907,"About 1500 Montanans died as a result of the war and 2437 were injured, as well as more than any other state on a per capita basis."
11908,25,montana,11908,"Remount's Montana station in Miles City provided 10,000 horse cavalry for the war, more than any other military post in the country."
11909,25,montana,11909,"The war created a boom for Montana's mining, forestry and agricultural interests as the demand for war materials and food increased."
11910,25,montana,11910,"In June 1917, the American Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917, which was extended by the Sedition Act of 1918."
11911,25,montana,11911,"In February 1918, the Assembly of Montana passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version."
11912,25,montana,11912,"Together, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, the army, or symbols by speech or other means."
11913,25,montana,11913,"The Montana law led to the arrest of more than 200 people and the conviction of 78 people, mainly of German or Austrian origin."
11914,25,montana,11914,More than 40 people have spent time in prison.
11915,25,montana,11915,"In May 2006, Governor Brian Schweitzer granted full posthumously pardons to all those convicted of violating the Montana Sedition Act."
11916,25,montana,11916,"The Montanans who opposed the entry of the United States into the war included groups of immigrants of German and Irish origin, as well as pacifist anabaptists such as the Hutterites and Mennonites, many of whom were also of Germanic origin."
11917,25,montana,11917,"In turn, pro-war groups such as the Montana Defence Council, created by Governor Samuel V. Stewart and the local ""loyalty committees""."
11918,25,montana,11918,The feeling of war was complicated by work problems.
11919,25,montana,11919,"The company Anaconda Copper, which was at its historic peak in copper production, was an extremely powerful force in Montana, but it also faced criticism and opposition from socialist newspapers and trade unions who were trying to make gains for their members."
11920,25,montana,11920,"In Butte, a multi-ethnic community of major European immigrants, trade unions, in particular the newly formed Union of Metal Mining Workers, were opposed to the war on the grounds that they mainly benefited from important interests in the softwood lumber and mining sector."
11921,25,montana,11921,"Following the explosion of mining production and the disaster of the speculatory mine in June 1917, Frank Little, world organizer of industrial workers, arrived in Butte to organize miners."
11922,25,montana,11922,He gave speeches with an incendiary antiwar rhetoric.
11923,25,montana,11923,"On 1 August 1917, he was dragged from his boarding school by masked vigilantes, and hanged on a railway braid, considered a lynching."
11924,25,montana,11924,The murder of Little and the subsequent strikes led to the dispatch of the National Guard to Butte to restore order.
11925,25,montana,11925,"Overall, anti-German and anti-labor sentiment increased and created a movement that led to the adoption of the Montana Sedition Act the following February."
11926,25,montana,11926,"In addition, the Defence Council has become a State body empowered to prosecute and punish persons tried in violation of the law."
11927,25,montana,11927,The Council has also adopted rules limiting public gatherings and prohibiting German speaking in public.
11928,25,montana,11928,"In the wake of the legislative action of 1918, emotions increased."
11929,25,montana,11929,U.S. prosecutor Burton K. Wheeler and several district court judges who hesitated to prosecute or convict accused persons were strongly criticized.
11930,25,montana,11930,"Wheeler was presented to the Defence Council, although he avoided formal proceedings, and a judge of the Forsyth District Court was indicted."
11931,25,montana,11931,There were burns of German-language books and several quasi-hangings.
11932,25,montana,11932,The ban on German speaking remained in force in the early 1920s.
11933,25,montana,11933,"Compliing the struggles in wartime, the 1918 influenza epidemic claimed the lives of more than 5,000 Montanians."
11934,25,montana,11934,"The suppression of civil liberties that occurred led some historians to dub this period ""the agony of Montana""."
11935,25,montana,11935,An economic depression began in Montana after World War I and lasted during the Great Depression until the beginning of World War II.
11936,25,montana,11936,"This has caused great difficulties for farmers, farmers and miners."
11937,25,montana,11937,"Wheat farms in eastern Montana make the state a major producer; wheat has a relatively high protein content, which requires high prices."
11938,25,montana,11938,"By the time the United States entered World War II on December 8, 1941, many Montanas had enlisted in the army to escape the bad national economy of the previous decade."
11939,25,montana,11939,"Over 40,000 Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war, and more than 57,000 joined before the end of the war."
11940,25,montana,11940,"These figures represented about 10 per cent of the population of the state, and Montana again provided one of the largest per capita troops in any state."
11941,25,montana,11941,"Many Amerindians were among those who served, including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became Code Talkers."
11942,25,montana,11942,At least 1500 Montanans died in the war.

11947,25,montana,11947,"In 1941, as she had done in 1917, she voted against the United States declaration of war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."
11948,25,montana,11948,"His was the only vote against the war, and following a public outcry over his vote, Rankin demanded police protection for some time."
11949,25,montana,11949,"Other pacifists tend to be those of the ""peace churches"" that generally opposed war."
11950,25,montana,11950,Many people claiming U.S. conscientious objector status were sent to Montana during the war as twins of smoke and for other tasks of fighting forest fires.
11951,25,montana,11951,"In 1942, the American army established camp Rimini near Helen to train sled dogs in winter."
11952,25,montana,11952,"During the Second World War, the planned USMontana warship was appointed in honor of the state, but it was never completed."
11953,25,montana,11953,Montana is the only one of the first 48 states that do not have a full warship to be named.
11954,25,montana,11954,Both Alaska and Hawaii have nuclear submarines that bear their name.
11955,25,montana,11955,Montana is the only State in the Union without a modern naval ship named in its honour.
11956,25,montana,11956,"However, in August 2007, Senator Jon Tester requested that a submarine be named USMontana."
11957,25,montana,11957,"Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced on September 3, 2015 that the Virginia class SSN-794 submarine will become the second warship to bear this name."
11958,25,montana,11958,"After the Second World War, Montana became host to the US Air Force (1947) Military Air Transport Service for airlift training in the Skymasters C-54 and, finally, in 1953, the Air Force and the Strategic Air Command Anti-missile Forces were based at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls."

11962,25,montana,11962,"At the end of 1962, missiles assigned to the 341st Strategic Missile Wing played a major role in the Cuban missile crisis."
11963,25,montana,11963,"When the Soviets withdrew their missiles from Cuba, President John F. Kennedy said that the Soviets had retreated because they knew he had an ""acé in the hole"", referring directly to the Minuteman missiles in Montana."

12468,26,nebraska,12468,Unicameral supporters also argued that a bicameral legislature had an important non-democratic feature in committees that reconciled the laws of the House with senators.
12469,26,nebraska,12469,Votes on these committees were secret and sometimes added provisions to bills that neither House had approved.
12470,26,nebraska,12470,The unicameral legislature of Nebraska now has rules that require bills to contain only one subject and to be considered for at least five days.
12471,26,nebraska,12471,"In 1934, due in part to the budgetary pressure of the Great Depression, the citizens of Nebraska launched a state initiative to vote on a constitutional amendment creating a unicameral legislature, which was approved, which effectively abolished the House of Representatives (the Lower House)."
12472,26,nebraska,12472,"Parliament met in the third building of the Capitol of the State of Nebraska, built between 1922 and 1932."
12473,26,nebraska,12473,It was designed by Bertram G. Goodhue.
12474,26,nebraska,12474,"Built from Indiana limestone, the base of the capitol is a cross inside a square."
12475,26,nebraska,12475,A 400-foot dome tower rises from this base.

12482,26,nebraska,12482,Nebraska is one of the two states (Maine is the other) that allow a split of the distribution of the state's electoral votes in presidential elections.
12483,26,nebraska,12483,"Under a 1991 law, two of Nebraska's five votes are awarded to the state-wide winner of the popular vote, while the other three go to the highest vote in each of the three districts of the State Congress."
12484,26,nebraska,12484,"For most of its history, Nebraska was a highly republican state."
12485,26,nebraska,12485,The Republicans carried the state in all but one presidential election since 1940: the shaken 1964 election of Lyndon B. Johnson.
12486,26,nebraska,12486,"In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won the state's five electoral votes by a 33-percentage-point margin (which makes Nebraska the fourth strongest Republican vote among the states) with 65.9 per cent of the total vote; only Thurston County, which is a US majority-native, voted for its democratic challenger John Kerry."
12487,26,nebraska,12487,"In 2008, the state split its electoral votes for the first time: Republican John McCain won the popular vote in Nebraska as a whole and two of its three congress districts; the second district, which includes the city of Omaha, went for Democratic Barack Obama."
12488,26,nebraska,12488,"Despite the current republican domination of Nebraska politics, the state has a long tradition of electing centrist members of both parties to state and federal office; for example, George W. Norris (who served for a few years in the Senate as an independent), J. James Exon, Bob Kerrey and Chuck Hagel."
12489,26,nebraska,12489,"Voters have bowed to the right in recent years, a trend that emerged when Hagel retired from the Senator in 2008 and was replaced by Conservative Republican Mike Johanns to the American Senator, as well as with the 2006 re-election of Ben Nelson, who was considered the senator's most conservative democrat until his retirement in 2013."

12500,27,nevada,12500,"It is bordered by Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east."
12501,27,nevada,12501,"Nevada is the 7th largest, the 19th least populated, but the 9th least populated in the United States."
12502,27,nevada,12502,"Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's residents live in Clark County, which is home to the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area, including three of the four largest incorporated cities."

12505,27,nevada,12505,"It is also known as the ""building state"" because it reached state status during the civil war (the words ""building state"" also appear on the State flag); as ""building state"" for the indigenous plant of the same name; and as ""building state""."
12506,27,nevada,12506,"The name means ""snow cover"" in Spanish, referring to the small overlap of Nevada with the mountain range of Sierra Nevada; however, the rest of Nevada is largely deserted and semi-arid, much of it in the Great Basin."
12507,27,nevada,12507,"The areas south of the Great Basin are in the Mojave Desert, while Lake Tahoe and Sierra Nevada are at the western limit."

12510,27,nevada,12510,The first Europeans to explore the region were Spanish.
12511,27,nevada,12511,They called the Nevada region (snow) because of the snow that covered the mountains in winter similar to Sierra Nevada in Spain.
12512,27,nevada,12512,"The region is part of the Alta California territory of the Vice-Royalty of New Spain, which gained independence as Mexico in 1821."
12513,27,nevada,12513,"The United States annexed the region in 1848 after its victory in the war between Mexico and America, and it was incorporated into the territory of Utah in 1850."
12514,27,nevada,12514,The discovery of money at Comstock Lode in 1859 led to a demographic boom that became a impetus for the creation of Nevada's territory from the territory of western Utah in 1861.
12515,27,nevada,12515,"Nevada became the 36th state on October 31, 1864, the second of the two states to join the Union during the civil war (the first being West Virginia)."

12517,27,nevada,12517,"In 1940, with a population of just over 110,000, Nevada was by far the least populated state, with less than half of the population of the next least populated state, Wyoming."

12519,27,nevada,12519,"Nevada is the only U.S. state where prostitution is legal, although it is illegal in its most populated areas – Clark County (Las Vegas), Washoe County (Reno) and Carson City (which, as an independent city, is not within the boundaries of any county)."
12520,27,nevada,12520,"The tourism industry remains the largest employer in Nevada, with the mining industry remaining an important sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth largest gold producer in the world."
12521,27,nevada,12521,"The name ""Nevada"" comes from the Spanish Nevada [ne.βaða], meaning ""covered with snow""."
12522,27,nevada,12522,"The Nevadas pronounce the second syllable with the ""a"" as in ""trap"" () while some people from outside the state can pronounce it with the ""a"" as in ""palm"" ()."
12523,27,nevada,12523,"Although this latter pronunciation is closer to the Spanish pronunciation, it is not the pronunciation used by the Nevadas."
12524,27,nevada,12524,"Harry Mortenson, Member of State, proposed a bill to recognize Nevada's (quasi-Spanish) pronunciation, although the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote."
12525,27,nevada,12525,The pronunciation of Nevada is the one used by the state legislature.
12526,27,nevada,12526,"At one point, the state's official tourism organization, TravelNevada, stylized the state's name as ""Nevăda"", with a breve on it indicating the locally preferred pronunciation, which was also available as a license plate drawing until 2007."
12527,27,nevada,12527,Nevada is located almost entirely in the province of the Basin and range and is divided by many north-south mountain ranges.
12528,27,nevada,12528,"Most of these areas have Endorheic valleys between them, which contradicts the image represented by the term Grand Bassin."
12529,27,nevada,12529,"Much of the northern part of the state is located in the Great Basin, a mild desert that experiences warm and cold temperatures in the summer and winter."
12530,27,nevada,12530,Sometimes the humidity of the Arizona monsoon will cause summer thunderstorms; Pacific storms may cover the area with snow.
12531,27,nevada,12531,"The highest temperature recorded by the state was 125°F (52°C) at Laughlin (605 feet or 184 metres) on June 29, 1994."

12535,27,nevada,12535,"All of these rivers are endorheic basins, ending in Walker Lake, Pyramid Lake, and Carson Pond, respectively."
12536,27,nevada,12536,"However, not all Nevada is in the Great Basin."
12537,27,nevada,12537,"The tributaries of the Snake River drain the far north, while the Colorado River, which also forms a large part of the border with Arizona, drains much of southern Nevada."
12538,27,nevada,12538,"The mountain ranges, some of which have peaks greater than 13,000 feet (4,000 m), are home to lush forests above the desert plains, creating islands of the sky for endemic species."
12539,27,nevada,12539,"The valleys are often no lower in altitude than 3,000 feet (910 m), while some in central Nevada are more than 6,000 feet (1,800 m)."
12540,27,nevada,12540,"The southern third of the state, where the Las Vegas area is located, is in the Mojave Desert."
12541,27,nevada,12541,The area receives less rain in winter but is closer to Arizona Monsoon in summer.
12542,27,nevada,12542,"The terrain is also lower, mainly below 4,000 feet (1,200 m), creating conditions for hot summer days and cold winter nights."
12543,27,nevada,12543,Nevada and California have by far the longest diagonal line (compared to cardinal directions) as the state boundary just over 400 miles (640 km).
12544,27,nevada,12544,"This line begins at Lake Tahoe close to 6.4 km offshore (in the direction of the border), and continues to the Colorado River where the boundaries of Nevada, California, and Arizona merge 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the Laughlin Bridge."
12545,27,nevada,12545,"The largest mountain range in the southern part of the state is the Spring Mountain Range, just west of Las Vegas."

12550,27,nevada,12550,Nevada is the driest in the United States.
12551,27,nevada,12551,"It is composed mainly of desert and semi-arid climatic regions, and, with the exception of the Las Vegas Valley, the average summer daytime temperature approaches 40°F (22°C) in much of the state."
12552,27,nevada,12552,"While winters in northern Nevada are long and quite cold, the winter season in the southern part of the state tends to be short and mild."

12562,27,nevada,12562,"In 1919, there were 17 counties in the state, ranging from 146 to 18,159 square miles (380 to 47,030 km2)."

12594,27,nevada,12594,"See History of Utah, History of Las Vegas, and the discovery of the first major American silver ore deposit at Comstock Lode under Virginia City, Nevada, in 1859."
12595,27,nevada,12595,"On 2 March 1861 the territory of Nevada separated from the territory of Utah and adopted its present name, abbreviated from the Sierra Nevada (Spanish for ""snow-covered mountain range"")."
12596,27,nevada,12596,The southern boundary of 1861 is commemorated by the historic marks of Nevada 57 and 58 in the counties of Lincoln and Nye.
12597,27,nevada,12597,"Eight days before the presidential election of 1864, Nevada became the 36th state of the Union, despite the absence of the minimum requirement of 60,000 residents to become a state."
12598,27,nevada,12598,"(At the time, the population of Nevada was only 10,000.)"
12599,27,nevada,12599,"Rather than sending the Nevada constitution to Washington by Pony Express, the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27 – the most expensive telegraph on file at the time for a single shipment."
12600,27,nevada,12600,"Finally, Washington's response came on October 31, 1864: ""the pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day has been admitted into the Union""."
12601,27,nevada,12601,"The state was rushed to 31 October to help secure the re-election of Abraham Lincoln on 8 November and Republican domination after the civil war in Congress, as the Nevada mining economy linked him to the more industrialized Union."

12603,27,nevada,12603,Nevada is one of the only two states to expand its borders considerably after its admission to the Union.
12604,27,nevada,12604,"(The other was the Missouri, which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the purchase of the plaque.)"

12606,27,nevada,12606,"Nevada reached its present southern limits on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the part of Pah-Ute County in Arizona territory west of the Colorado River, essentially all of the present Nevada south of the 37th parallel."
12607,27,nevada,12607,"The transfer was caused by the discovery of gold in the region, and officials thought that Nevada would be better able to monitor the expected population boom."
12608,27,nevada,12608,This area includes most of what is now Clark County and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area.
12609,27,nevada,12609,Mining has shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see Silver mining in Nevada).
12610,27,nevada,12610,"When Mark Twain lived in Nevada during the period described in Roughing It, mining led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth."
12611,27,nevada,12611,Mining and population declined temporarily in the late 19th century.
12612,27,nevada,12612,"However, the rich silver strike at Tonopah in 1900, followed by strikes at Goldfield and Rhyolite, created a second mining boom in Nevada and the Nevada population."
12613,27,nevada,12613,"Unregulated gambling was common in the first mining towns in Nevada, but it was banned in 1909 as part of a national anti-gambling crusade."

12619,27,nevada,12619,"Nuclear tests at the Nevada test site began with a 1 kiloton TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951."
12620,27,nevada,12620,The last atmospheric test was carried out on 17 July 1962 and underground weapons tests continued until 23 September 1992.
12621,27,nevada,12621,The location is known to have the highest concentration of nuclear weapons detonated in the United States
12622,27,nevada,12622,More than 80 per cent of the area of the state is owned by the federal government.
12623,27,nevada,12623,The main reason for this is that homesteads have not been allowed in sufficient size to be viable under the arid conditions prevailing throughout the Nevada desert.
12624,27,nevada,12624,"Instead, the first settlers would house land surrounding a water source and then graze cattle on adjacent public lands, which is unnecessary for agriculture without access to water (this model of livestock farming still prevails)."

12698,27,nevada,12698,"Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches provides a connecting service from Las Vegas to trains in Needles, California, Los Angeles, and Bakersfield, California; and from Stateline, Nevada, to Sacramento, California."

12709,27,nevada,12709,Nevada is one of the few states in the United States that do not have a continuous interstate highway linking its two major population centres – the road link between the Las Vegas and Reno regions is a combination of several interstate and American highways.
12710,27,nevada,12710,The itinerary proposed by Interstate 11 could possibly remedy this.
12711,27,nevada,12711,"The state is one of the few in the country to allow semi-trailers with three trailers – which could be called a ""road train"" in Australia."
12712,27,nevada,12712,"But the American versions are usually smaller, partly because they have to climb and descend a few steep mountain passes."
12713,27,nevada,12713,RTC Transit is the transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.
12714,27,nevada,12714,"The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a network of bus services across the Las Vegas Valley, including the use of The Deuce, a two-storey bus, on the Las Vegas Band and several peripheral roads."

12720,27,nevada,12720,"Several hotels also manage their own monorail lines between them, which are usually several blocks of length."

12722,27,nevada,12722,Reno-Tahoe International Airport (formerly Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the state.
12723,27,nevada,12723,Nevada has experienced a thriving solar energy sector.
12724,27,nevada,12724,An independent study conducted in 2013 concluded that solar energy users had created a net benefit of $36 million.
12725,27,nevada,12725,"However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission allowed NV Energy, the only state-owned electricity company, to charge higher rates and charges to solar panel users, resulting in an immediate collapse of the use of solar panels on the roof."
12726,27,nevada,12726,"In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository as the only site to be classified as a permanent repository for all highly radioactive wastes in the country."
12727,27,nevada,12727,"Under the Constitution of the State of Nevada, the powers of the Government of Nevada are divided into three separate departments: the Executive, composed of the Governor of Nevada and their Cabinet, as well as other elected members of the Constitution; the Legislative, composed of the Nevada Legislative Assembly and the Senate; and the Judicial, composed of the Nevada Supreme Court and the lower courts."
12728,27,nevada,12728,"The Governor is the Chief Magistrate of Nevada, the Head of the Executive Department of the State Government, and the Commander-in-Chief of the State Military Forces."
12729,27,nevada,12729,"The current governor is Steve Sisolak, a Democrat."
12730,27,nevada,12730,The Nevada Legislative Assembly is a bicameral body divided into an assembly and a senator.
12731,27,nevada,12731,Members of the Assembly serve for two years and members of the Senator for four years.
12732,27,nevada,12732,"The two Houses of the Nevada Legislative Assembly will be affected by the time limits from 2010, since senators and MPs/women will be limited to a maximum of 12 years in each chamber (by appointment or election that is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the Constitution that was recently confirmed by the Nevada Supreme Court in a unanimous decision."
12733,27,nevada,12733,"Each session of the legislature meets for a term of 120 days prescribed by the Constitution every odd year, or more if the governor requests an extraordinary session."
12734,27,nevada,12734,"On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a female majority in its legislature."

12736,27,nevada,12736,The Supreme Court of Nevada is the Supreme Court of the State and the head of the judicial branch of Nevada.
12737,27,nevada,12737,"Initial jurisdiction is shared between District Courts (with general jurisdiction), Courts and Municipal Courts (both with limited jurisdiction)."
12738,27,nevada,12738,"Appeals from district courts are addressed directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which, in the context of a model of derogatory jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the Court of Appeal for final resolution."
12739,27,nevada,12739,"The cities incorporated in Nevada, known as cities, have the power to legislate on anything that is not prohibited by law."
12740,27,nevada,12740,A recent movement has begun to allow local authorities to integrate the cities of Nevada to give them more flexibility and less restrictions on the part of the Legislative Assembly.
12741,27,nevada,12741,"The municipal councils of unincorporated cities are limited local administrations created either by the local county commission or by referendum, and play a purely consultative role and do not in any way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them."
12742,27,nevada,12742,"By 1900 the population of Nevada was the smallest of all states and was decreasing, as the difficulties of living in a ""wild desert"" began to prevail over the lure of money for many early settlers."
12743,27,nevada,12743,Historian Lawrence Friedman explained what happened next:
12744,27,nevada,12744,"With the advent of air conditioning for the summer and the mild winters of southern Nevada, the state's fortunes began to revolve around, as for Arizona, making these two states the fastest growth in the Union."
12745,27,nevada,12745,Nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal – in a licensed brothel in a county that has expressly voted to allow it.
12746,27,nevada,12746,"It is illegal in major jurisdictions such as Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), Washoe County (which contains Reno) and the independent city of Carson City."
12747,27,nevada,12747,"Nevada's first reputation as a ""divorce paradise"" came from the fact that before the revolution of no-fault divorce in the 1970s divorces were difficult to obtain in the United States."
12748,27,nevada,12748,"Having already legalized gambling and prostitution, Nevada has continued to strengthen its profile by adopting one of the nation's most liberal divorce laws."
12749,27,nevada,12749,"Accordingly, Williams v. North Carolina (1942), 317 US 287 (1942), in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that North Carolina should give ""full faith and credit"" to a divorce from Nevada."
12750,27,nevada,12750,"The Court amended its decision in Williams v. North Carolina (1945), 325 United States 226 (1945), stating that a State did not need to recognize a divorce in Nevada unless one of the parties was domiciled there at the time the divorce was granted and the forum State had the right to make its own decision."
12751,27,nevada,12751,"In 2009, Nevada's divorce rate was above the national average."
12752,27,nevada,12752,Nevada's tax laws aim to attract new residents and businesses to the state.
12753,27,nevada,12753,Nevada has no personal or corporate income tax.
12754,27,nevada,12754,"As Nevada does not collect income data, it cannot share this information with the federal government, the IRS."
12755,27,nevada,12755,The State sales tax (like VAT or GST) in Nevada varies according to the county.
12756,27,nevada,12756,"The state-wide tax rate is 6.85 per cent, and five counties (Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt and Mineral) charge this amount."
12757,27,nevada,12757,"Counties may charge additional rates through the approval of electors or through the approval of the state's legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax varies from 6.85 per cent to 8.37 per cent (Clark County)."
12758,27,nevada,12758,"Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county option taxes in addition to the state-wide rate: 0.25% for flood control, 0.50% for public transit, 0.25% for infrastructure, and 0.25% for more cops."
12759,27,nevada,12759,"In Washoe County, which includes Reno, the sales tax rate is 7,725%, due to the flood control county option rates, the ReTRAC railway trench project and public transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act, 1991."
12760,27,nevada,12760,"Nevada's minimum sales tax rate changed on July 1, 2009."
12761,27,nevada,12761,"The housing tax rate in the unincorporated Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas Band, is 12%."
12762,27,nevada,12762,"Within the boundaries of the cities of Las Vegas and Henderson, the housing tax rate is 13%."
12763,27,nevada,12763,Companies such as Apple Inc. reportedly created investment companies and funds in Nevada to avoid paying taxes.
12764,27,nevada,12764,"In 2009, the Nevada Legislature passed a bill establishing a national register of partnerships that allows homosexual couples to enjoy the same rights as married couples."
12765,27,nevada,12765,"In June 2015, gay marriage became legal in Nevada."
12766,27,nevada,12766,"Nevada provides a user-friendly environment for corporate formation, and many companies (especially in California) have formed in Nevada to take advantage of the benefits of Nevada's law."
12767,27,nevada,12767,Nevada companies offer great flexibility to the board of directors and simplify or avoid many of the rules that are burdensome for business leaders in other states.
12768,27,nevada,12768,"In addition, Nevada has no tax on deductibles, although it requires companies to have a licence for which the company must pay the State."
12769,27,nevada,12769,"Similarly, many U.S. states have laws of wear and tear limiting the amount of interest a lender can charge, but federal law allows companies to import these laws from their home state."
12770,27,nevada,12770,Nevada has very liberal laws on alcohol.
12771,27,nevada,12771,"Bars are allowed to remain open 24 hours a day, without ""last call""."
12772,27,nevada,12772,"Alcohol stores, convenience stores and supermarkets can also sell alcohol 24 hours a day and sell beer, wine and spirits."
12773,27,nevada,12773,"In 2016, Nevada voters approved Question 2, which legislates the possession, transportation and cultivation of quantities of marijuana for personal use for adults 21 years of age and older, and authorizes the creation of a regulated market for the sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age and older through state-licensed retail outlets."
12774,27,nevada,12774,"Nevada voters had already approved medical marijuana in 2000, but rejected the legalization of marijuana in a similar referendum in 2006."
12775,27,nevada,12775,Marijuana in all its forms remains illegal under federal law.
12776,27,nevada,12776,"In addition to legalizing cannabis, non-alcoholic drug laws are a notable exception to the libertarian principles of Nevada."
12777,27,nevada,12777,It is remarkable to have the most severe penalties for drug addicts in the country.
12778,27,nevada,12778,Nevada remains the only State to continue to use mandatory guidelines on minimum penalties for possession of drugs.

15125,33,north_dakota,15125,The rivalry between the two new States presented a dilemma that must first be admitted to exist.
15126,33,north_dakota,15126,Harrison ordered Secretary of State James G. Blaine to mix the papers and obscure the documents he signed first.
15127,33,north_dakota,15127,"The order was not recorded, so no one knows which Dakotas were admitted first."

15129,33,north_dakota,15129,"The carelessness of wheat producers, especially Norwegian immigrants, led to a populist political movement centered in the Non-partisan League (NPL) around the First World War."
15130,33,north_dakota,15130,The NPL presented candidates on the Republican ticket (but merged into the Democratic Party after the Second World War).
15131,33,north_dakota,15131,He tried to isolate North Dakota from the power of banks and out-of-state companies.

15134,33,north_dakota,15134,"These laws, still in force today, after being confirmed by the state and federal courts, make it almost impossible to seize agricultural land, because even after the seizure, the title to property cannot be held by a bank or a mortgage company."
15135,33,north_dakota,15135,"In addition, the North Dakota Bank, with powers similar to those of a Federal Reserve bank, exercised its power to limit the issuance of mortgages at risk and their guarantee in the form of derivative instruments, thereby preventing the collapse of housing prices in the state following the 2008 financial crisis."

15141,33,north_dakota,15141,"In recent years, the State has registered unemployment rates below the national average and has increased employment and population growth."
15142,33,north_dakota,15142,Much of the growth was based on the development of Bakken oil fields in the western part of the state.
15143,33,north_dakota,15143,"Estimates of the remaining amount of oil in the region vary, some of which are estimated to be over 100 years old."

15146,33,north_dakota,15146,"In 2016, the violent crime rate was three times higher than in 2004, with the increase occurring mainly in the late 2000s, coinciding with the oil boom era."
15147,33,north_dakota,15147,This occurred at a time when the national rate of violent crime slightly decreased.
15148,33,north_dakota,15148,Workers in oil boom cities were blamed for much of the increase.
15149,33,north_dakota,15149,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the North Dakota population was 762,062 on July 1, 2019, an increase of 13.30 per cent over the 2010 U.S. Census."
15150,33,north_dakota,15150,This makes North Dakota the U.S. state with the highest percentage of population growth since 2011.
15151,33,north_dakota,15151,"North Dakota is the fourth least populated state in the country; only Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming have fewer residents."
15152,33,north_dakota,15152,"In 1870, the North Dakota population increased by less than 2,000 to nearly 680,000 by 1930."
15153,33,north_dakota,15153,"Growth then slowed and the population fluctuated slightly over the last seven decades, reaching 617,761 people in the 1970 census, of whom 642,200 in the 2000 census."
15154,33,north_dakota,15154,"With the exception of Amerindians, the North Dakota population has a lower percentage of minorities than the nation as a whole."

15158,33,north_dakota,15158,"Throughout the second half of the 19th century and until the beginning of the 20th century, North Dakota, as well as most of the Midwest, experienced a massive influx of newcomers from the eastern United States and immigrants from Europe."
15159,33,north_dakota,15159,"North Dakota was a popular destination known to immigrant farmers and workers in general and their families, mainly Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom."
15160,33,north_dakota,15160,"Much of this colony was on the west side of the Red River Valley, as seen in South Dakota and parallel in Minnesota."
15161,33,north_dakota,15161,This region is well known for its fertile land.
15162,33,north_dakota,15162,"At the beginning of World War I, it was one of the richest agricultural areas in North America."
15163,33,north_dakota,15163,"But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants did not succeed in arid conditions."
15164,33,north_dakota,15164,Many family plots were too small to be successfully exploited.
15165,33,north_dakota,15165,"Between the 1930s and the end of the 20th century, the North Dakota population declined gradually, interrupted by a few brief increases."
15166,33,north_dakota,15166,Young adults with a university degree were particularly likely to leave the State.
15167,33,north_dakota,15167,"With the advance of the process of mechanization of agricultural practices, and the environmental conditions requiring more important land for successful agriculture, subsistence farming has proved too risky for families."
15168,33,north_dakota,15168,Many people moved to urban areas to find a job.
15169,33,north_dakota,15169,"Since the end of the 20th century, one of the main causes of migration from North Dakota has been the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates."
15170,33,north_dakota,15170,"The expansion of economic development programs has been encouraged to create skilled and high-tech jobs, but the effectiveness of these programs has been subject to debate."
15171,33,north_dakota,15171,"During the first decade of the 21st century, the population increased largely due to employment in the oil industry related to the development of tight oil fields (shale oil)."
15172,33,north_dakota,15172,"Elsewhere, the Amerindian population has increased, with some reserves attracting people from urban areas."
15173,33,north_dakota,15173,Immigration
15174,33,north_dakota,15174,North Dakota is one of the main places where refugees are resettled proportionally.

15176,33,north_dakota,15176,"During fiscal year 2014, 582 refugees settled in the State."
15177,33,north_dakota,15177,Fargo Mayor Mahoney said the acceptance of North Dakota by the largest number of refugees per capita should be celebrated given the benefits they bring to the state.

15184,33,north_dakota,15184,War and disease reduced their population at the same time as Europeans and Americans settled in the state.
15185,33,north_dakota,15185,"In the 21st century, most of the Northern Dakotas are of North European origin."

16245,36,oregon,16245,"According to Stewart, the name comes from the error of a engraver in a French map published at the beginning of the 18th century, on which the Ouisiconink River (Wisconsin) was spelled ""Ouaricon-sint"", broken on two lines with the -sint below, so there seems to be a river flowing to the west called ""Ouaricon""."

17536,39,south_carolina,17536,"The constitution of the State of 1895 overthrew it, reducing the role of the counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature; essentially the counties were agents of the State and governed by the General Assembly through the legislative delegation of each county."
17537,39,south_carolina,17537,They are geographically global.
17538,39,south_carolina,17538,"Since each county had a state senator, this position was particularly powerful."

17540,39,south_carolina,17540,"Meanwhile, the state had changed, with increasing urbanization, but rural counties retained proportionally more power since the legislative power was based on elected county representatives rather than on population districts."

17630,39,south_carolina,17630,"In Texas vs. White (1869), the Supreme Court ruled that the secession orders (including that of South Carolina) were invalid, and therefore these states had never left the Union."

17632,39,south_carolina,17632,"Until the presidential election of 1868, the South Carolina legislature, not the voters, chose state voters for the presidential election."
17633,39,south_carolina,17633,South Carolina was the last state to choose its voters in this way.
17634,39,south_carolina,17634,"On October 19, 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant suspended habeas corpus in nine counties of South Carolina under the Ku Klux Klan Act."

17640,39,south_carolina,17640,The state became a home of racial and economic tensions during the populist and agrarian movements of the 1890s.
17641,39,south_carolina,17641,A biracial Republican-Popularist coalition temporarily took power with the White Democrats.
17642,39,south_carolina,17642,"To prevent this from happening again, the Democrats adopted a new constitution in 1895 that effectively deprived almost all blacks and many poor whites of their voting rights because of new requirements for voting taxes, residence and literacy tests that have significantly reduced the electoral roll."
17643,39,south_carolina,17643,"In 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the electoral roll, although they constituted a majority of the population of the State."
17644,39,south_carolina,17644,"The 1900 census showed the extent of exclusion: the 782,509 African-Americans accounted for more than 58 per cent of the population of the state, but they were essentially without political representation in Jim Crow society."
17645,39,south_carolina,17645,"The constitution of 1895 overturned the local representative government, reducing the role of the counties to the agents of the state government, effectively governed by the General Assembly, through the legislative delegations of each county."

17648,39,south_carolina,17648,"Governor Pitchfork Ben Tillman, a populist, led the effort to disfranchise blacks and poor whites, although he controlled democratic state policy from the 1890s to 1910s with a base among the poor white farmers."
17649,39,south_carolina,17649,"During the constitutional convention of 1895, he supported another man's proposal that the State should adopt a rule of one drop and prohibit marriage between whites and anyone of known African descent."
17650,39,south_carolina,17650,Some members of the Convention have realized that prominent white families of some African descent may be affected by such legislation.
17651,39,south_carolina,17651,"In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal (which was abandoned), George Dionysius Tillman said in the opposition:"
17652,39,south_carolina,17652,The state has postponed such a law by one drop for years.

17655,39,south_carolina,17655,"The state has also converted its cotton agricultural base into more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful delegation to the Democratic Congress, a part of the South following the abandonment of black voting rights at the beginning of the century; and created tourism industries."

17658,39,south_carolina,17658,"In 1930, South Carolina had a white majority population for the first time since 1708."
17659,39,south_carolina,17659,South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the nineteenth amendment (1920) giving women the right to vote.
17660,39,south_carolina,17660,The South Carolina legislature then ratified the amendment on 1 July 1969.
17661,39,south_carolina,17661,The civil rights movement's struggle took place in South Carolina as in other states of the South.
17662,39,south_carolina,17662,"However, South Carolina experienced a much less violent movement than other southern states."
17663,39,south_carolina,17663,This quiet transition from a Jim Crow company occurred because the white and black state leaders were willing to accept the slow change rather than being totally reluctant to accept change.
17664,39,south_carolina,17664,"Other Southern Carolinians, like Senator Strom Thurmond, on the other hand, were among the nation's most radical and effective opponents of social equality and integration."
17665,39,south_carolina,17665,"In 2015, South Carolina had one of the lowest percentages among all states of women in the State Legislative Assembly, at 13.5% (only Louisiana, Oklahoma and Wyoming had a lower percentage; the national average was 24.3%; the highest percentage was in Colorado at 41%)."

17668,39,south_carolina,17668,"South Carolina was one of the first states to stop paying for ""early"" baby deliveries under Medicaid and private insurance."
17669,39,south_carolina,17669,"The term ""early elective"" is defined as an induction of work or a section of the Caesarean section between 37 and 39 weeks which is not medically based."
17670,39,south_carolina,17670,This change is intended to improve the health of babies and reduce unnecessary costs for South Carolina.
17671,39,south_carolina,17671,"On November 20, 2014, South Carolina became the 35th state to legalize same-sex marriages, when a federal court ordered the change."

17827,40,south_dakota,17827,"The LaVérendrye group buried a plaque near the site of modern Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of the Greater Louisiana."
17828,40,south_dakota,17828,"In 1762, the whole region was part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802."
17829,40,south_dakota,17829,"At the beginning of the 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as a dominant group in the region."
17830,40,south_dakota,17830,"In 1803 the United States purchased the territory of Louisiana, a region that included most of Napoleon Bonaparte's South Dakota, and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly known as the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the area."
17831,40,south_dakota,17831,"In 1817, an American fur trade post was established at the present Fort Pierre, which began the continued American colonization of the region."
17832,40,south_dakota,17832,"In 1855, the American army purchased Fort Pierre, but abandoned it in 1857, in favour of Fort Randall to the south."
17833,40,south_dakota,17833,"At that time, the establishment by the Americans and Europeans was rapidly increasing and, in 1858, the Yankton Sioux signed the 1858 treaty, giving the United States most of the present South Dakota."
17834,40,south_dakota,17834,Speculators founded two of the largest cities in South Dakota today: Sioux Falls in 1856 and Yankton in 1859.
17835,40,south_dakota,17835,"In 1861, the territory of Dakota was created by the United States government (it originally included North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Montana and Wyoming)."
17836,40,south_dakota,17836,"Colonization of the region, mainly by residents of the eastern United States and western and northern Europe, increased rapidly, especially after the completion of an eastern rail link with Yankton in 1873."
17837,40,south_dakota,17837,"In 1874, gold was discovered in the Black Hills during a military expedition led by George A. Custer and miners and explorers began illegally entering the land promised to the Lakota."
17838,40,south_dakota,17838,The Custer expedition took place despite the fact that the Sioux had received in 1868 the entire western half of the present South Dakota (West River) by the treaty of Laramie under the Great Sioux Reserve.
17839,40,south_dakota,17839,"The Sioux refused to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and the war broke out after the United States did not prevent white miners and settlers from entering the area."
17840,40,south_dakota,17840,"Finally, the United States won and separated the Sioux Great Reserve into five reserves, settling the Lakota there."
17841,40,south_dakota,17841,"In 1980, the Supreme Court and Congress ordered compensation, but the Lakota still refused to accept it, insisting on the return of their land."
17842,40,south_dakota,17842,"A growing population and political concerns (the accession of two states meant the arrival of four new senators for the Republican Party) led to the division of Dakota territory into two, and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations that officially admitted South Dakota and North Dakota to union on November 2, 1889."
17843,40,south_dakota,17843,Harrison made sure the papers were tight to hide which was signed first and the order went unnoticed.
17844,40,south_dakota,17844,"On December 29, 1890, the massacre of the injured knee occurred in the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve."
17845,40,south_dakota,17845,"Considered the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Lakota Sioux nation, the massacre resulted in the death of at least 146 Sioux, including a large number of women and children."
17846,40,south_dakota,17846,31 American soldiers were also killed in the conflict.
17847,40,south_dakota,17847,"In the 1930s, several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota."
17848,40,south_dakota,17848,"Lack of precipitation, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plain states."
17849,40,south_dakota,17849,"The fertile soil was blown into massive dust storms, and several crops were completely ruined."
17850,40,south_dakota,17850,"The Dust Bowl's experiences, combined with the seizure of local banks and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, have led many South Dakota to leave the state."
17851,40,south_dakota,17851,The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.

17859,40,south_dakota,17859,"In 2007, the recently closed Homestake gold mine near Lead was selected as a site for a new underground research facility, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory."
17860,40,south_dakota,17860,"Despite the increase in the population of the State and recent economic development, many rural areas have struggled over the past 50 years with the decline of local populations and the emigration of educated young adults to major cities in South Dakota, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states."
17861,40,south_dakota,17861,Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture have greatly contributed to the reduction in the number of small family farms and the resulting economic and demographic difficulties for rural cities.
17862,40,south_dakota,17862,"However, the state often ranks first for its way of life, and Gallup's 2018 Well-Being Index named South Dakota the happiest and healthier state in the United States."

17879,40,south_dakota,17879,Five of the state's counties are entirely within the boundaries of sovereign Indian reserves.
17880,40,south_dakota,17880,"Due to the limitations of climate and land, and the isolation of urban areas with higher employment opportunities, the standard of living on many South Dakota reserves is often well below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009."
17881,40,south_dakota,17881,"The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, Crow Creek Reserve, is 70% and 21% of households do not have plumbing or basic kitchen appliances."
17882,40,south_dakota,17882,A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Office found that 58 per cent of households on the Pine Ridge Indian Reserve did not have a telephone.
17883,40,south_dakota,17883,"The isolation of reserves also hinders their ability to generate income from gambling casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centres."
17884,40,south_dakota,17884,"In 1995, the legislator passed a law to make English the ""common language"" of the State."
17885,40,south_dakota,17885,"Since 2019, ""the language of the Great Sioux Nation, consisting of three dialects, Dakota, Lakota and Nakota"" is an official language."

17893,40,south_dakota,17893,Young people have settled in cities for other jobs.
17894,40,south_dakota,17894,"This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 counties in South Dakota losing their population between 1990 and 2000."
17895,40,south_dakota,17895,"During this period, nine counties experienced a population loss of more than 10 per cent, with Harding County in the northwest corner of the state losing nearly 19 per cent of its population."
17896,40,south_dakota,17896,Low birth rates and lack of young immigrants have led to an increase in the median age of many of these counties.
17897,40,south_dakota,17897,"In 24 counties, at least 20 per cent of the population is over the age of 65, compared to a national rate of 12.8 per cent."

18127,41,tennessee,18127,"The Blue Ridge area is at the eastern edge of Tennessee, which borders North Carolina."
18128,41,tennessee,18128,"This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the western Blue Ridge Mountains, which are subdivided into several sub-ranges, namely the Smoky Mountains, the Baldes Mountains, the Unicoi Mountains, the Unaka and Roan Highlands Mountains, and the Iron Mountains."
18129,41,tennessee,18129,"The average altitude of the Blue Ridge area is 1,500 metres above sea level."
18130,41,tennessee,18130,"Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the state, is located in this region."
18131,41,tennessee,18131,"The Blue Ridge area has never been so sparsely populated, and today most of them are protected by the Cherokee National Forest, the Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness areas and state parks."
18132,41,tennessee,18132,"The Ridge and Valley area, where many tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Tennessee Valley, is located west of the Blue Ridge for approximately 89 km."
18133,41,tennessee,18133,"This area of Tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges, such as Mount Bays and Mount Clinch."
18134,41,tennessee,18134,"The western part of the Tennessee Valley, where depressions become wider and ridges lower, is called the Grande Vallée."
18135,41,tennessee,18135,"In this valley are many cities and two of the three urban areas of the region, Knoxville, the third largest city in the state, and Chattanooga, the fourth largest city in the state."
18136,41,tennessee,18136,"The third urban area, the Tri-Cities, comprising Bristol, Johnson City and Kingsport and their surroundings, is northeast of Knoxville."
18137,41,tennessee,18137,Cumberland Plateau rises west of Tennessee Valley
18138,41,tennessee,18138,"The elevation of the Cumberland Plateau ranges from 1,500 to approximately 2,000 feet (460 to approximately 610 m) above sea level."
18139,41,tennessee,18139,"The Eastern Tennessee has several important transport links with the Middle and Western Tennessee, as well as the rest of the country and the world, including several important airports and interstates."
18140,41,tennessee,18140,"The McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) in Knoxville and Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA) in Chattanooga, as well as the Tri-Cities Regional Airport (TRI) offer air service to many destinations."
18141,41,tennessee,18141,"I-24, I-81, I-40, I-75 and I-26, as well as numerous state highways and other important roads, cross the Grande Division and connect Chattanooga, Knoxville and the Tri-Cities, as well as other cities such as Cleveland, Athens and Sevierville."
18142,41,tennessee,18142,"To the west of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim, an elevated plain that surrounds the Nashville Basin."
18143,41,tennessee,18143,"The northern section of the Highland Rim, known for its high tobacco production, is sometimes called the Pennyroyal Plateau, located mainly in southwestern Kentucky."
18144,41,tennessee,18144,The Nashville Basin is characterized by a rich and fertile agricultural country and a great diversity of natural fauna.
18145,41,tennessee,18145,The Middle Tennessee was a common destination for settlers who crossed the Appalachians from Virginia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
18146,41,tennessee,18146,"An important trade route called the Natchez Trace, created and used for many generations by American Indians, connects the middle Tennessee to the city of the lower Mississippi of Natchez."
18147,41,tennessee,18147,The Natchez Trace route served as the basis for a panoramic highway called Natchez Trace Parkway.
18148,41,tennessee,18148,Some of the last large American chestnut trees grow in this area.
18149,41,tennessee,18149,They are used to help reproduce burning-resistant trees.
18150,41,tennessee,18150,The Middle Tennessee is one of the main centres of the population and transport of the State as well as the heart of the state government.
18151,41,tennessee,18151,"Nashville (the capital), Clarksville and Murfreesboro are its largest cities."
18152,41,tennessee,18152,"Interstates 24, 40, 65 and 840 serve the Division, with the first three meetings in Nashville."
18153,41,tennessee,18153,"The western part of the Highland Rim and Nashville Basin is the Gulf Coast Plain, which includes the Mississippi River embayment."
18154,41,tennessee,18154,The Gulf Coast Plain is the predominant terrestrial region of Tennessee in terms of area.
18155,41,tennessee,18155,It is part of the vast geographic area that begins in the Gulf of Mexico and extends north to southern Illinois.
18156,41,tennessee,18156,"In Tennessee, the Gulf Coast Plain is divided into three sections that extend from the Tennessee River to the east to the Mississippi River to the west."
18157,41,tennessee,18157,"The eastmost stretch, about 16 km wide, consists of hilly lands along the west bank of Tennessee."
18158,41,tennessee,18158,To the west of this narrow strip of land is a vast area of hills and streams that extends to the Mississippi River
18159,41,tennessee,18159,"In Memphis, Tennessee Bottoms ends with steep bluffs overlooking the river."
18160,41,tennessee,18160,"To the west of Tennessee Bass is the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, less than 300 feet (91 m) above sea level."
18161,41,tennessee,18161,"This area of lowlands, flood plains and marshlands is sometimes called the Delta region."
18162,41,tennessee,18162,Memphis is the economic center of West Tennessee.
18163,41,tennessee,18163,"Most of the West Tennessee lands remained Indian until the Passion of Chickasaw in 1818, when the Chickasaw gave up their lands between Tennessee and Mississippi."
18164,41,tennessee,18164,The portion of Chickasaw's divestment in Kentucky is now known as Jackson's Purchase.
18165,41,tennessee,18165,The areas under the control and management of the National Parks Service are as follows:
18166,41,tennessee,18166,"Fifty-four state parks, covering some 132,000 acres (530 km2), as well as parts of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Cherokee National Forest, and Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, are located in Tennessee."
18167,41,tennessee,18167,"Sportsmen and visitors are attracted to Reelfoot Lake, originally formed by the earthquakes of 1811–12; the stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, as well as the lotus bed that covers the shallow waters, give the lake a strange beauty."
18168,41,tennessee,18168,"Most of the condition has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a temperate or humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures."
18169,41,tennessee,18169,"The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee's climate, with southern winds accounting for most of the annual rainfall in the state."
18170,41,tennessee,18170,"In general, the state has warm summers and mild to cold winters with generous precipitation throughout the year, with the highest average monthly precipitation generally in winter and spring between December and April."
18171,41,tennessee,18171,"The driest months, on average, are from August to October."
18172,41,tennessee,18172,"On average, the condition receives 50 inches (130 cm) of precipitation each year."
18173,41,tennessee,18173,Snowfall ranges from 5 inches (13 cm) in West Tennessee to more than 80 inches (200 cm) in the highest mountains of East Tennessee.
18174,41,tennessee,18174,"Summers in the state are generally warm and humid, with most of the average state of about 90°F (32°C) during the summer months."
18175,41,tennessee,18175,"Winters tend to be mild to cold, increasing in freshness at higher altitudes."
18176,41,tennessee,18176,"In general, for areas outside the highest mountains, the middle hollows of the night are close to freezing for most states."
18177,41,tennessee,18177,"The highest recorded temperature was 113°F (45°C) at Perryville on August 9, 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature was −32°F (−36°C) at Mountain City on December 30, 1917."
18178,41,tennessee,18178,"Although the state is far enough away from the coast to avoid any direct impact of a hurricane, the state's location makes it likely to be affected by remnants of tropical cyclones that weaken on land and can cause significant precipitation, such as tropical storm Chris in 1982 and hurricane Opal in 1995."
18179,41,tennessee,18179,"The condition has an average of about fifty days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large hail and harmful winds."
18180,41,tennessee,18180,"tornadoes are possible throughout the state, the most vulnerable being Western Tennessee and Middle Tennessee."
18181,41,tennessee,18181,"Sometimes, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating April 2011 tornadoes that killed twenty people in North Georgia and Southeast Tennessee."
18182,41,tennessee,18182,"On average, the State has 15 tornadoes per year."
18183,41,tennessee,18183,"tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes that have died."
18184,41,tennessee,18184,"Winter storms are an occasional problem, such as the famous 1993 Blizzard, although ice storms are more likely."
18185,41,tennessee,18185,"Fog is a persistent problem in some parts of the State, particularly in Eastern Tennessee."
18186,41,tennessee,18186,"The capital and largest city is Nashville, although Knoxville, Kingston and Murfreesboro have all served as state capitals in the past."
18187,41,tennessee,18187,The metropolitan area of 13 counties of Nashville has been the largest in the state since the beginning of 1990.
18188,41,tennessee,18188,Memphis was the largest city in the state until 2018 when it was overtaken by Nashville.
18189,41,tennessee,18189,"Chattanooga and Knoxville, both east of the Smoky Mountains, are about a third of this size."
18190,41,tennessee,18190,"Clarksville is a fifth largest population centre, 72 km northwest of Nashville."
18191,41,tennessee,18191,"Murfreesboro is the sixth town in Tennessee, with a population of 146,900."
18192,41,tennessee,18192,"The area now known as Tennessee was inhabited for the first time by the Paleo-Indians nearly 12,000 years ago."
18193,41,tennessee,18193,"The names of the cultural groups that inhabited the area between the first colony and the time of European contact were unknown, but several distinct cultural phases were named by archaeologists, including Archaic (8000–1000 B.C.), Woodland (1000 B.C. – 1000 B.C.) and Mississippi (1000–1600 B.C.), whose chiefs of staff were the cultural predecessors of the Muscogee people who lived in the Tennessee Valley before Cherokee's migration into river waters."
18194,41,tennessee,18194,"The first European excursions recorded in today's so-called Tennessee were three expeditions led by Spanish explorers, namely Hernando de Soto in 1540, Tristan de Luna in 1559 and Juan Pardo in 1567."
18195,41,tennessee,18195,"Pardo has registered the name ""Tanasqui"" of a local Indian village, which has evolved to the present name of the state."
18196,41,tennessee,18196,At that time Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of Muscogee and Youchi.
18197,41,tennessee,18197,"Perhaps because of devastating European diseases the Indian tribes, which would have left a vacuum of population, and also because of the expansion of the European colony in the north, the Cherokee moved south of the area now called Virginia."
18198,41,tennessee,18198,"As European settlers spread throughout the region, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all the Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw peoples, and finally the Cherokee peoples in 1838."
18199,41,tennessee,18199,"The first British colony in today's Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the colony of South Carolina at Fort Loudoun, near Vonore today."
18200,41,tennessee,18200,On that date Fort Loudoun became the westernmost British outpost.
18201,41,tennessee,18201,The fort was designed by John William Gerard of Brahm and built by forces under British captain Raymond Demeré.
18202,41,tennessee,18202,"After his completion, Captain Raymond Demeré gave up command on 14 Aug. 1757 to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré."
18203,41,tennessee,18203,"Hostilities broke out between the British and the nearby Cherokees of Overhill, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with its surrender on 7 Aug. 1760."
18204,41,tennessee,18204,"The next morning Captain Paul Demeré and several of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner."
18205,41,tennessee,18205,"In the 1760s, long hunters from Virginia explored much of the Eastern and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began to arrive at the end of the decade."
18206,41,tennessee,18206,"The majority of 18th-century settlers were English or predominantly English, but almost 20% were also Scottish-Irish."
18207,41,tennessee,18207,"These settlers formed the Watauga Association, a community built on land leased to the Cherokee peoples."
18208,41,tennessee,18208,"During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Watauga at Sycomore Shoals (now Elizabethton) was attacked (1776) by Dragging Canoe and his belligerent faction of Cherokee, who were aligned with the British loyalists."
18209,41,tennessee,18209,These Cherokee renegades were designated by the settlers as Chickamauga.
18210,41,tennessee,18210,They opposed the annexation by North Carolina of the Washington District and the simultaneous establishment of the Transylvanian colony to the north and west.
18211,41,tennessee,18211,"The lives of many settlers were spared from the first attacks of warriors by the warnings of Nancy Ward, cousin of Dragging Canoe."
18212,41,tennessee,18212,"The border fort, on the banks of the Watauga River, later served as a gathering place in 1780 for the surmounted men, in order to cross the Appalachian Mountains, engage and defeat the British army during the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina."
18213,41,tennessee,18213,Three counties in Washington District (now part of Tennessee) left North Carolina in 1784 and formed Franklin State.
18214,41,tennessee,18214,"Efforts to gain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (currently eight) had joined North Carolina in 1789."
18215,41,tennessee,18215,"North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized in the southwestern territory."
18216,41,tennessee,18216,"In order to encourage settlers to move westward into the new territory, in 1787 the mother state of North Carolina ordered to cut off a road to take settlers to the Cumberland colonies, from the south end of Mount Clinch (in Eastern Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville)."
18217,41,tennessee,18217,"The Trace was called the ""North Carolina Road"" or ""Avery Trace"", and sometimes ""The Wilderness Road"" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's ""Wilderness Road"" through the Cumberland Gap)."
18218,41,tennessee,18218,Tennessee was admitted to the Union on 1 June 1796 as 16th State.
18219,41,tennessee,18219,It was the first state created from a territory under the jurisdiction of the U.S. federal government.
18220,41,tennessee,18220,"Apart from the 13 former colonies, only Vermont and Kentucky preceded the creation of the state of Tennessee, and neither was ever a federal territory."
18221,41,tennessee,18221,"The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, article I, section 31, states that the starting point for identifying the boundary is the extreme height of the stone mountain, at the point where the Virginia line intersects it, and leads essentially the extreme heights of the mountain ranges through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee after the Amerindian cities of Cowee and Old Chota, from thence along the main ridge of said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the State; all the territory, land and waters to the west of said line are included within the boundaries and boundaries of the newly formed Tennessee State."
18222,41,tennessee,18222,"Part of the provision also specified that the boundaries and jurisdiction of the State would include the future acquisition of land, reference to possible land exchanges with other States or the acquisition of territories west of Mississippi."
18223,41,tennessee,18223,"As other white settlers arrived in Tennessee, they came into conflict with the Amerindian tribes."
18224,41,tennessee,18224,"During the administration of US President Martin Van Buren, nearly 17,000 Cherokees and about 2,000 Black enslaved by the Cherokees were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839."
18225,41,tennessee,18225,"American troops forced them to walk from ""emigration depots"" in Eastern Tennessee, such as Fort Cass, to Indian territory further west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma."
18226,41,tennessee,18226,"During this relocation, approximately 4,000 Cherokees died along the west road."
18227,41,tennessee,18227,"In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi, ""the path where we shouted""."
18228,41,tennessee,18228,"The Cherokees were not the only Amerindians forced to emigrate as a result of the expulsion efforts of the Indians from the United States, and the expression ""Trail of Tears"" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indians, particularly among the ""Five Civilized Tribes""."
18229,41,tennessee,18229,This sentence was derived from a description of the previous emigration of the Choctaw Nation.
18230,41,tennessee,18230,"In February 1861 the secessionists of the Tennessee government, led by Governor Isham Harris, asked for approval of an agreement to break ties with the United States, but the Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a margin of 54-46%."
18231,41,tennessee,18231,"The strongest opposition to secession came from the Eastern Tennessee, which later attempted to form a separate state aligned with the Union."
18232,41,tennessee,18232,"Following the confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln's appeal for Tennessee and other states in response, Governor Isham Harris began the military mobilization, submitted a secession order to the General Assembly, and made direct openings to the confederate government."
18233,41,tennessee,18233,"On May 7, 1861, the Parliament of Tennessee ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States."
18234,41,tennessee,18234,"On 8 June 1861, when the inhabitants of the Middle Tennessee changed their position considerably, the voters approved a second referendum calling for secession, thus becoming the last state to do so."
18235,41,tennessee,18235,"But the State of Scott, supported by the Union, was also created at that time, and remained a de facto enclave of the United States throughout the war."
18236,41,tennessee,18236,"Many major battles of the American civil war were fought in Tennessee, most of the Union's victories."
18237,41,tennessee,18237,Ulysse S. Grant and the U.S. Navy took control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862.
18238,41,tennessee,18238,They held off the confederate counter-attack in Shiloh in April.
18239,41,tennessee,18239,"Memphis fell into the Union in June, after a naval battle on the Mississippi River in front of the city."
18240,41,tennessee,18240,The capture of Memphis and Nashville gave the Union control of the western and middle sections.
18241,41,tennessee,18241,This control was confirmed at the Battle of Murfreesboro in early January 1863 and by the subsequent Tullahoma campaign.
18242,41,tennessee,18242,"Despite the strength of the unionist sentiment in East Tennessee (with the exception of Sullivan County, which was strongly pro-Confederate), the Confederates held the region."
18243,41,tennessee,18243,"The Confederates, led by General James Longstreet, attacked General Burnside's Fort Sanders in Knoxville and lost."
18244,41,tennessee,18244,"It was a big blow to the confederate momentum of East Tennessee, but Longstreet won the Battle of Bean's Station a few weeks later."
18245,41,tennessee,18245,"The Confederates besieged Chattanooga during the Chattanooga campaign in early autumn 1863, but were chased by Grant in November."
18246,41,tennessee,18246,"Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General Braxton Bragg, who led the Army of the Tennessee of Perryville, in Kentucky, to another Confederate defeat in Chattanooga."
18247,41,tennessee,18247,The last major battles came when the Confederates invaded the Middle Tennessee in November 1864 and were verified at Franklin and then completely dispersed by George Thomas in Nashville in December.
18248,41,tennessee,18248,"Meanwhile, President Abraham Lincoln appointed the displaced and native Tennesseean Senator Andrew Johnson as the military governor of the state."
18249,41,tennessee,18249,"When the proclamation of emancipation was announced, Tennessee was largely owned by the Union's forces."
18250,41,tennessee,18250,"Thus, he was not among the states listed in the Proclamation, and the Proclamation did not release any slaves there."
18251,41,tennessee,18251,"Nevertheless, African-American slaves escaped the lines of the Union to gain freedom without waiting for official action."
18252,41,tennessee,18252,"Old and young, men, women and children camped near the Union troops."
18253,41,tennessee,18253,"Thousands of former slaves ended up fighting on the Union side, with a total of almost 200,000 across the South."
18254,41,tennessee,18254,"On 22 February 1865, the legislature of Tennessee approved an amendment to the constitution of the State prohibiting slavery."
18255,41,tennessee,18255,State voters approved the amendment in March.
18256,41,tennessee,18256,It also ratified the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (abolish slavery in each state) on 7 April 1865.
18257,41,tennessee,18257,"In 1864 Andrew Johnson, Tennessee War Democrat, was elected vice-president under Abraham Lincoln."
18258,41,tennessee,18258,He became president after Lincoln's assassination in 1865.
18259,41,tennessee,18259,"Under Johnson's clemency policy of readmission, Tennessee was the first of the secessionary states to have its elected members re-admitted to the United States Congress on 24 July 1866."
18260,41,tennessee,18260,"Since Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the only secessionist state that did not have a military governor during the reconstruction period."
18261,41,tennessee,18261,"After the formal end of Reconstruction, the struggle for power in Southern society continued."
18262,41,tennessee,18262,"Through violence and intimidation against liberated men and their allies, White Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other southern states in the late 1870s and 1880s."
18263,41,tennessee,18263,"Over the next decade, the state legislature has adopted increasingly restrictive laws to control African Americans."
18264,41,tennessee,18264,"In 1889, the General Assembly adopted four laws that were described as electoral reform, with the cumulative effect of essentially depriving most African Americans of rural areas and small towns, as well as many poor whites."
18265,41,tennessee,18265,"The legislation included the implementation of a voting fee, the registration schedule and registration requirements."
18266,41,tennessee,18266,Tens of thousands of taxpayers were not represented for decades in the 20th century.
18267,41,tennessee,18267,"The laws on the abandonment of voting rights accompanied the laws of Jim Crow passed at the end of the 19th century, which imposed segregation in the state."
18268,41,tennessee,18268,"In 1900, African-Americans accounted for almost 24 per cent of the population of the State, and there were 480,430 citizens who lived mainly in the central and western parts of the State."
18269,41,tennessee,18269,"In 1897, Tennessee celebrated its centenary of state (although a year after the anniversary of 1896) with a large exhibition in Nashville."
18270,41,tennessee,18270,"A large-scale replica of the Parthenon was built for the celebration, located in what is now Nashville Centennial Park."
18271,41,tennessee,18271,"On 18 August 1920, Tennessee became the thirty-sixth and final state necessary to ratify the nineteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave women the right to vote."
18272,41,tennessee,18272,"Most African-Americans and many poor whites, both men and women, have still not been registered on the electoral roll."
18273,41,tennessee,18273,"The need to create work for the unemployed during the Great Depression, the desire for rural electrification, the need to control annual floods in the spring and to improve maritime capacity on the Tennessee River all led to the federal establishment of the Tennessee Valley Administration (TVA) in 1933."
18274,41,tennessee,18274,"Thanks to the power of the TVA projects, Tennessee quickly became the largest public service provider in the country."
18275,41,tennessee,18275,"During the Second World War, the abundant TVA electric power led the Manhattan project to locate one of the main sites for the production and isolation of military-grade fissile material in Eastern Tennessee."
18276,41,tennessee,18276,The planned Oak Ridge community was built from scratch to provide housing for facilities and workers.

18451,41,tennessee,18451,"Like the U.S. federal government, the Tennessee government has three parties."
18452,41,tennessee,18452,"The Executive is headed by the Governor of Tennessee, who holds office for a term of four years and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms."
18453,41,tennessee,18453,The Governor is the only government-wide official elected.
18454,41,tennessee,18454,"Unlike most states, the state does not directly elect the lieutenant governor; the senator of Tennessee elects his president, who is lieutenant governor."

18469,41,tennessee,18469,The State had two previous constitutions.
18470,41,tennessee,18470,"The first was adopted in 1796, the year Tennessee joined the union, and the second was adopted in 1834."
18471,41,tennessee,18471,The 1870 Constitution prohibits martial law in its jurisdiction.
18472,41,tennessee,18472,This may be the result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of military control by the U.S. government's (North) Union forces after the American civil war.
18473,41,tennessee,18473,"Tennessee politics, like that of most American states, are dominated by republican and democratic parties."
18474,41,tennessee,18474,"Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state until the period of the American civil war; for decades, a third east of the state was strongly republican and two thirds west voted mostly democratic."
18475,41,tennessee,18475,"This division was linked to the model of agriculture, plantations and state slavery."
18476,41,tennessee,18476,"The eastern part was made up of Yemeni farmers, but the middle and western Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton that depended on slave labour."
18477,41,tennessee,18477,These areas became democratic after the war.
18478,41,tennessee,18478,"During Reconstruction, freed men and former free-coloured people were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party."

18480,41,tennessee,18480,"After the reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have a competitive party policy, but in the 1880s, the White-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a voting fee for voter registration."
18481,41,tennessee,18481,"They have been used to deprive most African Americans of their right to vote, and their power in state and local politics has been significantly reduced."
18482,41,tennessee,18482,"In 1900, African-Americans made up 23.8% of the population of the state, concentrated in the Middle and Western Tennessee."
18483,41,tennessee,18483,"In the early 1900s, the State Legislative Assembly approved a form of city commission government based on the broad vote of a few positions on a committee council; several cities adopted this as another means of limiting African-American political participation."
18484,41,tennessee,18484,"In 1913, the State Parliament passed a bill allowing cities to adopt this structure without legislative approval."
18485,41,tennessee,18485,"After the abandonment of the right to vote of the blacks, the Republican Party of Tennessee became a predominantly white sectional party supported only in the eastern part of the state."
18486,41,tennessee,18486,"In the 20th century, with the exception of two republican landslides at the national level of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee strongly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio governor James Cox, and in 1928, when he voted more resolutely for Herbert Hoover over New York governor Al Smith), the state was part of the solid democratic South until the 1950s."
18487,41,tennessee,18487,"In this post-war decade, he voted twice for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the armed forces during the Second World War."
18488,41,tennessee,18488,"Since then, more state voters have turned to Republican support, and candidates for the democratic presidency have only carried Tennessee four times."
18489,41,tennessee,18489,"In 1960, African-Americans accounted for 16.45% of the state's population."
18490,41,tennessee,18490,"It was not until after the mid-1960s and the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that they were able to vote in full again, but new arrangements, such as the Municipal Main Committee Governments, were adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation."
18491,41,tennessee,18491,Former government.
18492,41,tennessee,18492,Winfield Dunn and former U.S. Senator Bill Brock won in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among the Whites for state-wide victory.
18493,41,tennessee,18493,Tennessee has chosen governors from different parties since 1970.
18494,41,tennessee,18494,"At the beginning of the 21st century, Republican voters controlled most of the state, especially in rural and suburban areas outside the cities; democratic power was mainly confined to the urban core of the four major cities, and was particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis."
18495,41,tennessee,18495,The latter includes a large African-American population.
18496,41,tennessee,18496,"Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in Eastern Tennessee before the 1960s."
18497,41,tennessee,18497,"The 1st and 2nd districts of Tennessee, located respectively in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, are among the few republican historic districts of the South."
18498,41,tennessee,18498,The inhabitants of these districts supported the Union on Confederation during the civil war.
18499,41,tennessee,18499,"The first one has been in Republican hands ever since 1881, and the Republicans (or their predecessors) have held it for all but four years since 1859."
18500,41,tennessee,18500,The latter has been permanently held by Republicans or their predecessors since 1859.
18501,41,tennessee,18501,"In the 2000 presidential election, Vice-President Al Gore, an American Democrat"
18502,41,tennessee,18502,"Senator of Tennessee, did not bear his original state, an unusual event but revealing the strengthening of Republican support."
18503,41,tennessee,18503,"Republican George W. Bush received increased support in 2004, with his margin of victory in the state rising from 4% in 2000 to 14% in 2004."
18504,41,tennessee,18504,"Candidates for the democratic presidency of the southern states, such as Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, are generally better off than their northern counterparts in Tennessee, especially among split-ticket voters outside metropolitan areas."

18507,41,tennessee,18507,"In the 2008 elections, the Republican party took control of the two chambers of the Tennessee legislature for the first time since the reconstruction."
18508,41,tennessee,18508,"In 2008, about 30 per cent of state voters identified themselves as independent."
18509,41,tennessee,18509,"Baker v. Carr (1962) of the United States Supreme Court established the principle of ""one man, one voice"", requiring that state legislatures redistribute the distribution of Congress according to the decennial censuses."
18510,41,tennessee,18510,He also demanded that the two chambers of state legislatures be population-based to be represented rather than geographical districts such as counties.
18511,41,tennessee,18511,This case was the result of a legal action that challenged the long-standing rural bias in the distribution of seats in the Tennessee legislature.
18512,41,tennessee,18512,"After decades of under-representation of urban populations in many state legislatures, this important decision has led to increased (and proportional) importance in the policy of the State by cities and, ultimately, the suburbs, legislators and state officials in relation to their population within the State."
18513,41,tennessee,18513,"The decision also applied to many other states that had long been controlled by rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont and Montana."
18514,41,tennessee,18514,"Tennessee maintains four law enforcement entities: Tennessee Road Patrol, Tennessee Wildlife Agency, Tennessee Investigation Bureau and Tennessee Environment and Conservation Department."

18522,41,tennessee,18522,"Each sheriff's office is responsible for the service of warrants, court security, prison operations and primary law enforcement in unincorporated areas of a county, as well as support to municipal police services."
18523,41,tennessee,18523,Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police service to provide police services within the limits of their organization.

18530,41,tennessee,18530,"From 1913 to 1915, there was an interruption of executions, but they were restored in 1916 when electrocution became the new method."
18531,41,tennessee,18531,"From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (Furman v. Georgia) that the death penalty was unconstitutional, there were no other executions."

18591,42,texas,18591,"When Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Aboriginal people divided into several smaller tribes."
18592,42,texas,18592,"These included Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan and Uto-Aztecan."
18593,42,texas,18593,"The peoples of Pueblan Uto-Aztecan lived near the Rio Grande in the western part of the state, the Apachy Athabaskan-speaking tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region, and the Atakapans were mainly centered along the Gulf coast."
18594,42,texas,18594,"At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, Aranama, lived in southern Texas."
18595,42,texas,18595,"All this cultural group, mainly centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct."
18596,42,texas,18596,It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the original state.
18597,42,texas,18597,"At the time of the exploration of the region, it belonged to the well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztécan people who had turned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the sixteenth century."
18598,42,texas,18598,"It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans."
18599,42,texas,18599,"No culture was dominant in the present Texas region, and many peoples lived there."
18600,42,texas,18600,"Native American tribes living within the present-day boundaries of Texas include Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa and Wichita."
18601,42,texas,18601,"The name Texas derives from táysha, a word in the Caddoan language of Hasinai, which means ""friends"" or ""allies""."
18602,42,texas,18602,"The area was mainly controlled by the Spaniards during the first two centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution."
18603,42,texas,18603,"They were not particularly kind to their indigenous populations, let alone to the Caddoans, who had no confidence because their culture was shared between the Spanish and the French."
18604,42,texas,18604,"When the Spaniards briefly managed to conquer the colony of Louisiana, they decided to change tactics and try to be extremely friends with the Indians, which they continued even after the French had taken over the colony."
18605,42,texas,18605,"After the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, the United States inherited this strange circumstance."
18606,42,texas,18606,The Caddoans preferred the American company and almost all their population migrated to the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18607,42,texas,18607,"The Spaniards felt swindled after spending so much time and effort and began trying to attract the Caddo, promising them even more land."
18608,42,texas,18608,"Apparently, without really knowing how they arrived, the United States (which had begun to convince the tribes to self-segregate whites by selling everything and moving west since they won the Louisiana purchase) faced an overflow of indigenous peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced populations to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas."
18609,42,texas,18609,"These included Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Senatorca, all of whom had come to see the Caddoans as saviors, making these peoples very influential."
18610,42,texas,18610,The question of whether an Amerindian tribe was friendly or warrior was crucial for the fate of European explorers and settlers on this land.
18611,42,texas,18611,"Friendly tribes have taught newcomers to grow native crops, prepare food, and hunt wild game."
18612,42,texas,18612,Warrior tribes have made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans by their attacks and resistance to newcomers.
18613,42,texas,18613,"During the Texas Revolution, the United States became heavily involved."
18614,42,texas,18614,Previous treaties with Spain prohibit both parties from militarizing its indigenous population in any potential conflict between the two nations.
18615,42,texas,18615,"At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans began to spread."
18616,42,texas,18616,"The Caddoans were always without any clue when they were questioned, The Texas and American authorities in the region were never able to find any solid evidence linking them to it and often it was so far from Caddoan lands, it made little sense."
18617,42,texas,18617,"It seems very likely that these are false flag attacks aimed at triggering a cascade effect to force indigenous people under Caddoan's influence to enter into armed conflict without violating any treaty, preferably on the Spanish side."
18618,42,texas,18618,"Although no evidence was found of the culprit's identity, Texas officials at the time repeatedly tried to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check."
18619,42,texas,18619,"Moreover, the Caddoans have never turned to violence because of this, with the exception of self-defence cases."
18620,42,texas,18620,"By the 1830s, the United States had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the tears trail."
18621,42,texas,18621,"Fearing the compensation of other indigenous peoples, Indian agents throughout the eastern United States began desperately trying to convince all their indigenous peoples to uproot and move westward."
18622,42,texas,18622,These were the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas.
18623,42,texas,18623,"After the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their indigenous peoples, but did not honour the old land claims or agreements."
18624,42,texas,18624,This began the movement of indigenous people northward into what would become the modern Oklahoma Indian territory.
18625,42,texas,18625,"The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda."
18626,42,texas,18626,"Nine years later, the shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans of what is now Texas."
18627,42,texas,18627,"Cabeza de Vaca reports that in 1528, when the Spaniards landed in the area, ""half of the natives died of bowel disease and blamed us."""
18628,42,texas,18628,Cabeza de Vaca also commented on the way of life of the Texas Native Ignatians:
18629,42,texas,18629,Francisco Vázquez de Coronado describes his meeting in 1541:
18630,42,texas,18630,The European powers ignored the area until they accidentally settled there in 1685.
18631,42,texas,18631,René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle's calculation errors allowed him to establish the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River.
18632,42,texas,18632,The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.
18633,42,texas,18633,"In 1690, the Spanish authorities, concerned that France was a competitive threat, built several missions in eastern Texas."
18634,42,texas,18634,"After the Amerindian resistance, the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico."
18635,42,texas,18635,"When France began to settle in Louisiana, mainly in the southern part of the state, in 1716, the Spanish authorities reacted by creating a new series of missions to eastern Texas."
18636,42,texas,18636,"Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civil colony in the region."
18637,42,texas,18637,The hostile indigenous tribes and the distance of the neighbouring Spanish colonies discouraged the settlers from settling in the area.
18638,42,texas,18638,It was one of the least populated provinces in New Spain.
18639,42,texas,18639,"In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Apaches of Lipan irritated many tribes, including the Comanches, Tonkawa and Hasinai."
18640,42,texas,18640,The Comanches signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later contributed to the defeat of the Apache and Karankawa tribes.
18641,42,texas,18641,"With the establishment of more missions, the priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes."
18642,42,texas,18642,"At the end of the 18th century, only a few nomadic tribes did not convert to Christianity."
18643,42,texas,18643,"When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, the United States authorities insisted that the agreement also included Texas."
18644,42,texas,18644,"The border between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the Sabine River in 1819, which is now the border between Texas and Louisiana."

18649,42,texas,18649,"In hopes that other settlers will reduce Comanche's almost constant raids, Mexican Texas has liberalized its immigration policies to allow immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain."

18653,42,texas,18653,"Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority of whom came from the United States."
18654,42,texas,18654,Texas's population has grown rapidly.
18655,42,texas,18655,"By 1825 there were about 3,500 people in Texas, most of whom were Mexicans."
18656,42,texas,18656,"By 1834, the population had increased to about 37,800 people, with only 7,800 of Mexican origin."
18657,42,texas,18657,"Most of those first settlers who arrived with Austin and shortly thereafter were less than lucky people in life, as Texas was devoid of the comforts found elsewhere in Mexico and the United States during this period."

18689,42,texas,18689,"With broad popular support, Texas first requested annexation to the United States in 1836, but its status as a slave country caused its admission to controversy and was initially rejected."

18820,42,texas,18820,The continental crust forms a stable mesoproterozoic craton that transforms through a wide continental margin and a transient crust into a true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico.
18821,42,texas,18821,The oldest rocks in Texas date from Mesoproterozoic and are about 1600 million years old.
18822,42,texas,18822,"These igneous and metamorphic precambrian rocks underlie most of the state and are exposed in three places: the Llano Uprising, Van Horn and Franklin Mountains, near El Paso."
18823,42,texas,18823,Sedimentary rocks cover most of these ancient rocks.
18824,42,texas,18824,"The oldest sediments were deposited on the sides of a torn continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian."
18825,42,texas,18825,This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvania subperiod to form Pangea.
18826,42,texas,18826,This is the buried ridge of the Appalachian Mountains – Pennsylvania Continental Collision Ouachita.

18831,42,texas,18831,"Today, 14 to 19 km of sediment is buried under the Texas continental shelf and a large portion of the remaining U.S. oil reserves are here."
18832,42,texas,18832,"At the beginning of its formation, the nascent basin of the Gulf of Mexico was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of the Jurassic age."
18833,42,texas,18833,These salt deposits form salt domes and are located in eastern Texas along the Gulf coast.
18834,42,texas,18834,Outcrops in eastern Texas consist of cretaceous and paleogenic sediments that contain significant deposits of eocene lignite.
18835,42,texas,18835,"The Mississippi and Pennsylvania sediments in the north; the Permian sediments in the west; and the Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast, and on the Texas continental shelf contain oil."

18863,42,texas,18863,These events enabled Galveston to take over as the main port city.
18864,42,texas,18864,"Hurricane Galveston of 1900 then devastated this city, killing about 8,000 people, and even up to 12,000 people."
18865,42,texas,18865,This makes it the most deadly natural disaster in the history of the United States.

18867,42,texas,18867,"The storm lasted a long time, allowing it to drop unprecedented amounts of rain on the Greater Houston area and surrounding counties."
18868,42,texas,18868,The result has been widespread and catastrophic floods that have flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.
18869,42,texas,18869,"Harvey eventually became the most expensive hurricane in the world, causing damage estimated at $198.6 billion, exceeding the cost of Hurricane Katrina."

19450,43,utah,19450,Western Utah is mainly an arid desert with a basin and a range topography.
19451,43,utah,19451,Small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape.
19452,43,utah,19452,"The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being relatively flat because of once forming the bed of the old Lake Bonneville."

19477,43,utah,19477,"More than 70 percent of the land is either BLM, Utah State Trustland, or US National Forest, US National Park, US National Monument, National Recreation Area or US Wilderness Area."
19478,43,utah,19478,Utah is the only state where each county contains a national forest.
19479,43,utah,19479,"Utah has a dry, semi-arid climate in the desert, although its many mountains have a wide variety of climates, the highest points in the mountains of Uinta being above the wood line."
19480,43,utah,19480,"Dry weather is the result of the state's location in the rain shadow of Sierra Nevada, California."
19481,43,utah,19481,Half of the eastern state lies in the rain shadow of the Wasatch Mountains.
19482,43,utah,19482,"The main source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually on the way to major Pacific storms from October to May."
19483,43,utah,19483,"In summer, the state, especially the south and east of Utah, is on the path to monsoon moisture from the Gulf of California."
19484,43,utah,19484,"Most lowlands receive less than 12 inches (305 mm) of precipitation per year, although corridor I-15, including the densely populated Wasatch Front, receives about 15 inches (381 mm)."
19485,43,utah,19485,"The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest area in the state, with less than 5 inches (127 mm)."
19486,43,utah,19486,"Snowfall is common in all valleys, with the exception of southern valleys."
19487,43,utah,19487,"Although St. George receives only about 3 inches (76 mm) per year, Salt Lake City sees about 60 inches (1,524 mm), increased by snow from the Great Salt Lake effect, increasing total snowfall to the south, south-east and east of the lake."
19488,43,utah,19488,"Some areas of the Wasatch range in the lake effect trail receive up to 500 inches (12,700 mm) per year."

19491,43,utah,19491,"The ever-deep powder snow has led the Utah ski industry to adopt the slogan ""The greatest snow on earth"" in the 1980s."
19492,43,utah,19492,"In winter, temperature inversions are a common phenomenon in Utah basins and valleys, resulting in thick fog and fog that can last weeks at a time, especially in the Uintah basin."
19493,43,utah,19493,"Although at other times of the year its air quality is good, winter inversions give Salt Lake City one of the worst winter pollution in the country."
19494,43,utah,19494,"Previous studies have shown a widespread decline in snow quantity on Utah, accompanied by a decline in snow-precipitation ratio, while anecdotal claims have been made that the measured changes in snow quantity in Utah are false and do not reflect actual changes."
19495,43,utah,19495,"A 2012 study found that the proportion of winter precipitation (January to March) falling as snow has decreased by 9% over the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in precipitation and a slight decrease in snowfall."
19496,43,utah,19496,"During this time, snow depth observed in Utah decreased and was accompanied by a steady decrease in snow cover and surface albedo."
19497,43,utah,19497,"Weather systems likely to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number, with those that produce snowfall decreasing at a much higher rate."
19498,43,utah,19498,"Utah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its rise, and very hot summers on a state scale (except for mountain areas and high mountain valleys)."

19501,43,utah,19501,"Temperatures below 0°F (−18°C) are expected occasionally in most regions of the state in most years, although some regions often see it (for example, the city of Randolph has an average of about fifty days a year with such low temperatures)."
19502,43,utah,19502,"In July, average heights range from about 85 to 100°F (29 to 38°C)."
19503,43,utah,19503,"However, low humidity and high altitude usually lead to large temperature variations, resulting in cool nights on most summer days."
19504,43,utah,19504,"The record temperature in Utah was 118°F (48°C), recorded south of St. George on July 4, 2007, and the low record was -69°F (−56°C), recorded at Peter Sinks in the Bear River Mountains of northern Utah on February 1, 1985."

19511,43,utah,19511,"tornadoes are uncommon in Utah, with an average of two striking the state each year, rarely more intense than the EF1."
19512,43,utah,19512,"An exception, however, was the unprecedented F2 Salt Lake City Tornado that moved directly to downtown Salt Lake City on August 11, 1999, killing one person, wounding another sixty, and causing approximately $170 million in damage."
19513,43,utah,19513,"The only other deadly tornado reported in Utah's history was a 7-year-old girl who was killed while camping in Summit County on July 6, 1884."
19514,43,utah,19514,"The last of the above intensity tornado (E)F0 occurred on September 8, 2002, when an F2 tornado struck Manti."

20010,44,vermont,20010,Significant changes in political distribution have taken place in Vermont and other affected States.

20012,44,vermont,20012,"In the context of the redistribution, residents of urban areas had to obtain an equitable share of the distribution in the two houses in each State."
20013,44,vermont,20013,"Vermont and other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as well as several southern states in those years, which had not been recoupled since the beginning of the century."

20046,44,vermont,20046,"Some rural speakers realize t as a glottal stop (mitten sounds like ""mi'in"" and Vermont as ""Vermon"")."
20047,44,vermont,20047,"A decreasing segment of the Vermont population, generally rural and male, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g., in English)."
20048,44,vermont,20048,"cows with an elevated vowel like [khyz] and climb with a sustained vowel, a little rounded like [yyd])."
20049,44,vermont,20049,"Eastern New England English, also present in New Hampshire, Maine and eastern Massachusetts, was common in eastern Vermont in the mid-20th century and before, but it became rare."
20050,44,vermont,20050,"This accent reduces the sound r in words ending in r (the farmer sounds like ""farm-uh"") and adds a r sound to some words ending in vowel (idea sounds like ""idee-er"") was common."

21033,46,washington,21033,Washington was named in honour of President George Washington by a law of the United States Congress when the Washington Territory was created in 1853.
21034,46,washington,21034,"The territory was to be named ""Columbia"" for the Columbia River and the District of Columbia, but the representative of Kentucky Richard H. Stanton found the name too similar to the District of Columbia (the national capital, itself containing the City of Washington), and proposed to appoint the new territory after President Washington."
21035,46,washington,21035,Washington is the only US state named after a president.
21036,46,washington,21036,"The confusion over the state of Washington and the city of Washington, D.C., led to the renaming of proposals during the state process for Washington in 1889, including David Dudley Field II's suggestion to name the new state ""Tacoma""."
21037,46,washington,21037,There was no support for these proposals.
21038,46,washington,21038,"Washington, D.C., own state movement in the 21st century includes a proposal to use the name ""State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth"", which would be in conflict with the current state of Washington."

21041,46,washington,21041,"It borders the Idaho to the east, bounded primarily by the meridian flowing north from the confluence of the Snake River and the Clearwater River (approximately 117°02'23"" to the west), with the exception of the southernmost section where the boundary follows the Snake River."
21042,46,washington,21042,"Oregon is to the south, with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the Oregon-Washington border."
21043,46,washington,21043,"During the Washington partition of Oregon, the initial boundary plan followed the Columbia River east to the confluence with the snake, then followed the Snake River east; this was modified to keep the fertile lands of Walla Walla in Washington."
21044,46,washington,21044,West of Washington lies the Pacific Ocean.
21045,46,washington,21045,"Its northern border lies mainly along the 49th parallel, then by sea across the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait, with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north."
21046,46,washington,21046,"Washington is part of an area known as Pacific Northwest, a term that always refers to at least Washington and Oregon, and which may or may not include some or all of the following, as intended by the user: Idaho, Western Montana, Northern California, British Columbia and Alaska."
21047,46,washington,21047,"The high mountains of the Cascade chain extend north-south, bisecting the state."
21048,46,washington,21048,"In addition to the west of Washington and east of Washington, residents call both parts of the state the west and east side, the wet side and the dry side, or the ""Timberland"" and the ""Wheatland"", the latter couple more often in the names of regional-specific businesses and institutions."
21049,46,washington,21049,"These terms reflect geography, climate, and the land industry on both sides of the Cascades."
21050,46,washington,21050,"From the Cascade Mountains westward, Western Washington has a predominantly Mediterranean climate, with mild temperatures and humid winters, autumns and springs, and relatively dry summers."
21051,46,washington,21051,"The Cascade chain has several volcanoes, which reach significantly higher altitudes than the rest of the mountains."
21052,46,washington,21052,"From north to south, these major volcanoes are Mount Baker, the Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount Sainte-Hélène and Mount Adams."
21053,46,washington,21053,All are active volcanoes.
21054,46,washington,21054,"Mount Rainier, the highest mountain in the state, is 80 km south of Seattle City, from which it is visible."

21058,46,washington,21058,"Western Washington is also home to the Olympic Mountains, well west of the Olympic Peninsula, which are home to dense coniferous forests and temperate rainforest areas."
21059,46,washington,21059,"These deep forests, such as the Hoh rainforest, are among the only rainforests on the American continent."
21060,46,washington,21060,"Indeed, although Western Washington does not always suffer from a high amount of rain measured in inches of rain per year, it always has more rainy days per year than most other places in the country."

21063,46,washington,21063,"Excerpted on January 17, 2021."
21064,46,washington,21064,"Frequent rain and cloud cover in western Washington is a major plot point in the popular Twilight book, which is located in western Washington precisely because of its relative lack of sun."
21065,46,washington,21065,"The eastern part of Washington – the eastern part of the state of the Cascades – has a relatively dry climate, which contrasts sharply with the western side."
21066,46,washington,21066,It includes large areas of semi-arid steppe and some really arid deserts in the rain shadow of the Cascades
21067,46,washington,21067,"Despite limited rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important activity in much of eastern Washington, as the soil is very productive and irrigation, supported by dams along the Columbia River, is quite widespread."
21068,46,washington,21068,"Population spread in eastern Washington is dominated by access to water, particularly to rivers."
21069,46,washington,21069,"The main cities are all located next to rivers or lakes, most of which are named after the river or lake they adhere to."
21070,46,washington,21070,"More to the east, the climate becomes less arid, and annual precipitation increases as we go east to 21.2 inches (54 mm) at Pullman, near the Washington-Idaho border."
21071,46,washington,21071,The Okanogan Highlands and the rugged massif of Kettle River and the Selkirk Mountains cover much of the northeastern quadrant of the state.
21072,46,washington,21072,The Palous area south-east of Washington was a prairie that was primarily converted to agricultural land and extends to the blue mountains.
21073,46,washington,21073,"As noted above, Washington's climate varies considerably from west to east."
21074,46,washington,21074,"A Mediterranean climate predominates in western Washington, and a much drier semi-arid climate prevails east of the Cascade chain."
21075,46,washington,21075,"Major factors that determine Washington's climate include the large, low-pressure, high-pressure, semi-permanent systems of the North Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade Mountains."
21076,46,washington,21076,"In spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the northern Pacific Ocean, causing a clockwise spiral of air."
21077,46,washington,21077,"For Washington, this means that prevailing northwestern winds bring relatively fresh air and a predictable dry season."
21078,46,washington,21078,"In autumn and winter, a low-pressure cyclone system takes over in the northern Pacific Ocean."
21079,46,washington,21079,"Inward spiral air in the opposite direction of clockwise motion brings the dominant winds from Washington to the southwest, bringing relatively warm and humid air masses and a predictable wet season."
21080,46,washington,21080,"The term ""Pineapple Express"" is commonly used to describe the events of the atmospheric river, where repeated storm systems are led by this persistent cyclone in the tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions of the Pacific Northwest."
21081,46,washington,21081,"Despite the existence of a marine climate similar to that of many coastal cities in Western Washington, there are exceptions such as the events of 1880, 1881, 1893 and 1916, and the winters of 1883–84, 1915–1916, 1949–1950 and 1955–1956, among others."
21082,46,washington,21082,"During these events, western Washington experienced up to 1,800 metres of snow, temperatures below 18°C, three months of snow on the ground, and frozen lakes and rivers for weeks."
21083,46,washington,21083,"The lowest officially recorded temperature in Seattle is 0°F (−18°C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-lying areas at about three hours from Seattle recorded lows as cold as −48°F (−44°C)."
21084,46,washington,21084,The oscillation of the south greatly influences the weather during the cold season.
21085,46,washington,21085,"During the El Niño phase, the jet enters the United States further south through California, so late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snow."
21086,46,washington,21086,"The La Niña phase reinforces the jet in the northwest Pacific, so Washington has more rain and snow than average."
21087,46,washington,21087,"In 2006, the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group published The Impacts of Climate Change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities presented, given the potential for rising global temperatures and their effects on Washington's state."
21088,46,washington,21088,Precipitation in Washington varies considerably from east to west.
21089,46,washington,21089,"The western part of the Olympic Peninsula receives up to 160 inches (4,100 mm) of precipitation each year, making it the wettest area of the 48 neighbouring states and a temperate rainforest."
21090,46,washington,21090,Weeks can pass without a clear day.
21091,46,washington,21091,"The west slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the largest annual snowfalls (in some places more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimetres of water equivalent) in the country."
21092,46,washington,21092,"In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm)."
21093,46,washington,21093,Precipitation then increased eastward towards the Rocky Mountains (approximately 120 miles east of the Idaho border).
21094,46,washington,21094,"The Olympic mountains and waterfalls aggravate this climate pattern by causing an orographical uplift of blowing air masses inside the Pacific Ocean, resulting in high levels of precipitation on the wind side of the mountains and low levels on the left side."
21095,46,washington,21095,This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic mountains and the Cascade chain.
21096,46,washington,21096,"In both cases, slopes from the southwest to the wind receive high precipitation and mild and cool temperatures."
21097,46,washington,21097,"Although the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often as snow at higher altitudes."
21098,46,washington,21098,"Mount Baker, near the northern border of the state, is one of the most snowy places in the world."
21099,46,washington,21099,"In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season: 1,140 inches (95 ft; 29 m)."
21100,46,washington,21100,"To the east of the Cascades, a large area has strong rain shadow effects."
21101,46,washington,21101,"Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington State, with the strongest effects of rain shadow at relatively low elevations on the central Columbia Plateau, especially in the area just east of the Columbia River, from the Snake River to the Okanagan Highland."
21102,46,washington,21102,"Thus, instead of rainforests, much of eastern Washington is covered with dry meadows, shrub steppe and sand dunes."
21103,46,washington,21103,The average annual temperature ranges from 51°F (11°C) on the Pacific coast to 40°F (4°C) in the northeast.
21104,46,washington,21104,The lowest temperature recorded in the state was -48°F (−44°C) in Winthrop and Mazama.
21105,46,washington,21105,The highest temperature recorded in the state was 118°F (48°C) at the ice port dam.
21106,46,washington,21106,The two records were set east of the Cascades.
21107,46,washington,21107,"Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, long-lasting drizzles in winter and warm temperate summers."
21108,46,washington,21108,"The Eastern region, which does not enjoy the general moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean, sometimes experiences an extreme climate."
21109,46,washington,21109,Cold Arctic fronts in winter and heat waves in summer are not uncommon.
21110,46,washington,21110,Temperatures in the western region were only 107°F (42°C) in Centralia and up to 6°F (−21°C) in Longview.
21111,46,washington,21111,"Forests cover about half of the land area of the state, mainly west of the Northern Cascades."
21112,46,washington,21112,"About two-thirds of Washington's forest area is owned by the state, 64% of which is federal land."
21113,46,washington,21113,"Common trees and plants in the area are camassia, Douglas-fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many ferns."
21114,46,washington,21114,"The various wild areas of the state provide a sanctuary, with large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals."
21115,46,washington,21115,"The Pacific coast surrounding the San Juan Islands is heavily populated by white-headed, grey-headed and humpback whales."
21116,46,washington,21116,"In eastern Washington, the flora is very different."
21117,46,washington,21117,Tumbleweeds and sage dominate the landscape through large parts of the countryside.
21118,46,washington,21118,"Russian olive trees and other trees are common on the banks of rivers; however, apart from the banks of rivers, huge parts of eastern Washington have no natural trees at all (although many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course)."
21119,46,washington,21119,There is a greater variety of flora in the Blue Mountains and in the eastern slopes of the Cascades.
21120,46,washington,21120,"Native state mammals include bat, black bear, bobcat, cougar, coyote, deer, elk, grey wolf, hare, moose, mountain beaver, muskrat, opossum, pocket gopher, rabbit, raccoon, river otter, squirrel and squirrel."
21121,46,washington,21121,"Due to the extent of geography, Washington State is home to several different ecoregions, allowing for a variety of bird species."
21122,46,washington,21122,"This range includes raptors, shorebirds, woodbirds, prairie birds, ducks and others."
21123,46,washington,21123,"There have also been a large number of species introduced in Washington, D.C., dating back to the early 18th century, including horses and burros."
21124,46,washington,21124,"Channel catfish, lamprey and sturgeon are among the 400 known freshwater fish."
21125,46,washington,21125,"With the Cascade Frog, there are several forms of snakes that define the most prominent reptiles and amphibians."
21126,46,washington,21126,Coastal bays and islands are often inhabited by abundant quantities of molluscs and whales.
21127,46,washington,21127,"There are five species of salmon that go up in the western Washington area, from streams to spawning grounds."
21128,46,washington,21128,Washington has a variety of National Parks Service units.
21129,46,washington,21129,"These include Alta State National Park, Roosevelt Lake National Recreation Area, San Juan Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and three national parks - Olympic National Park, Northern Cascade National Park and Mount Rainier National Park."
21130,46,washington,21130,The three national parks were established between 1899 and 1968.
21131,46,washington,21131,"Nearly 95 per cent (876,517 acres, 354,714 hectares, 3,547.14 square kilometres) of the Olympic National Park area has been designated ""Wild Nature"" under the National Nature Conservation System."
21132,46,washington,21132,"In addition, 143 state parks and 9 national forests are managed by the Washington State Park System and the United States Forest Service."

21134,46,washington,21134,"It is managed together as the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, covering a considerably larger area of approximately 3,239,404 acres (1,310,940 ha)."
21135,46,washington,21135,"The skeletal remains of Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most complete human remains found in North America, were discovered in Washington."
21136,46,washington,21136,"The region has been known to host megathrust earthquakes in the past, the last being the Cascadia earthquake of 1700."
21137,46,washington,21137,"Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the region had many Aboriginal tribes, remarkable for their totem poles and their adorned canoes and masks."

21144,46,washington,21144,"It was not discovered until Charles William Barkley, captain of the imperial eagle, saw it in 1787."
21145,46,washington,21145,"The straits were explored by Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer George Vancouver in 1792."
21146,46,washington,21146,"The Spanish-British Nootka convention of 1790 ended Spanish exclusivity claims and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, including Great Britain and Russia, as well as the new United States."

21152,46,washington,21152,"Britain and the United States have accepted what has since been described as the ""joint occupation"" of land west of the continental ditch to the Pacific Ocean under the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which establishes the 49th parallel as the international boundary west of Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains."
21153,46,washington,21153,The resolution of territorial and treaty issues in the western Pacific has been postponed to a later date.
21154,46,washington,21154,"In 1819, Spain ceded its rights north of the 42nd parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession."
21155,46,washington,21155,Negotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades have failed to resolve a compromise border and the Oregon border dispute has been strongly contested between Great Britain and the United States.
21156,46,washington,21156,The joint occupation between Britain and the United States lasted several decades.
21157,46,washington,21157,"The Hudson's Bay Company, which had previously discouraged the establishment because it was in conflict with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the Columbia District."

21162,46,washington,21162,"Whitman's settlement in 1843 would help the Oregon Trail, the land-emigration route to the west, settle for thousands of emigrants in the following decades."
21163,46,washington,21163,"Marcus provided medical care to the Amerindians, but when Indian patients, who did not have immunity from new ""European"" diseases, died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held the ""medical man"" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and killed Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the Whitman massacre in 1847."

21171,46,washington,21171,"Initially, the border of Washington territory extended more east than that of the present state, including what is now the Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana."
21172,46,washington,21172,The creation of the Idaho territory in 1863 established the last eastern border.
21173,46,washington,21173,"A constitution of the state of Washington was drafted and ratified in 1878, but it was never formally adopted."

21491,47,west_virginia,21491,"The Calicua also began to designate themselves as Cherokees shortly after, showing an apparent additional fusion."
21492,47,west_virginia,21492,"These Shattaras were closely related to the tribes that formed in the south following the Westo, the Yuchi and Cherokee."
21493,47,west_virginia,21493,"From 1715 to 1717, the Yamasee War broke out."
21494,47,west_virginia,21494,The senator allegedly took sides for the Yuchi and was allegedly destroyed by the Yamasee allies.
21495,47,west_virginia,21495,"Therefore, if the Senatorndoa were the same tribe as the Moneton, it would mean the collapse of the Shattara-Moneton culture."
21496,47,west_virginia,21496,"Another tribe that appeared in the area was the Canaragay, or Kanawha."
21497,47,west_virginia,21497,"Later, they migrated to Maryland and merged into colonial culture."
21498,47,west_virginia,21498,"In 1671 General Abraham Wood, under the direction of Royal Governor William Berkeley of the colony of Virginia, sent a party from Fort Henry led by Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam to survey the territory."

21500,47,west_virginia,21500,"According to some sources, the Knights of Governor Alexander Spotswood's Golden Horseshoe Expedition in 1716 (for which the state named Golden Horseshoe Competition for 8th grades) had entered Pendleton County; however, modern historians interpret the original accounts of the trip as suggesting that none of the expedition's riders ventured much more west of the Blue Ridge Mountains than Harrisonburg, Virginia."
21501,47,west_virginia,21501,"John Van Metre, an Indian merchant, entered the northern part in 1725."
21502,47,west_virginia,21502,"That same year, German settlers from Pennsylvania founded New Mecklenburg, the present Shepherdstown, on the Potomac River, and others followed."
21503,47,west_virginia,21503,"King Charles II of England, in 1661, granted a company of gentlemen the land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, known as Neck Nord."
21504,47,west_virginia,21504,"Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax de Cameron finally took possession of this concession, and in 1746 a stone was erected at the source of the North Branch Potomac River to mark the western boundary of its concession."
21505,47,west_virginia,21505,A considerable part of this land was surveyed by young George Washington between 1748 and 1751.
21506,47,west_virginia,21506,"Washington's newspaper indicated that there were already many squatters, largely of German origin, along the southern branch of the Potomac River."
21507,47,west_virginia,21507,"Christopher Gist, a surveyor in the employ of the first Ohio company, composed mainly of Virginians, explored the country along the Ohio River north of the mouth of the Kanawha River between 1751 and 1752."
21508,47,west_virginia,21508,"The company sought the establishment of a fourteenth colony under the name of ""Vandalia""."
21509,47,west_virginia,21509,"Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, although they were hindered by the Amerindian resistance."
21510,47,west_virginia,21510,"Few Amerindians lived permanently within the current boundaries of the state, but the area was a common hunting ground, traversed by many trails."
21511,47,west_virginia,21511,"During the French and Indian wars (the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe), the French Indian allies almost destroyed the scattered British colonies."

21514,47,west_virginia,21514,"At the signing of the Dunmore War of Camp Charlotte, Cornstalk agreed to recognize the Ohio River as the new border with the ""Long Knives."""
21515,47,west_virginia,21515,"In 1776, however, the Shawnee were back at war, joining the Chickamauga, a Cherokee band known for the area where they lived."
21516,47,west_virginia,21516,The Amerindian attacks on settlers continued until after the American Revolutionary War.
21517,47,west_virginia,21517,"During the war, settlers in western Virginia were usually active Whigs and many served in the continental army."
21518,47,west_virginia,21518,"However, the Claypool rebellion of 1780–81, in which a group of men refused to pay the taxes imposed by the Continental Army, showed endurance of war in what became Western Virginia."
21519,47,west_virginia,21519,Social conditions in western Virginia were quite different from those in the eastern part of the state.
21520,47,west_virginia,21520,"The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable part of immigration came through Pennsylvania and included Germans, Scottish-Irish Protestants, and settlers from the northerly states."
21521,47,west_virginia,21521,The eastern and southern counties were established primarily by the eastern Virginians.
21522,47,west_virginia,21522,"During the American Revolution, the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of ""Westsylvania"" was presented in Congress, on the grounds that the mountains had a barrier almost impassable to the east."
21523,47,west_virginia,21523,"The wilderness of the country made slavery unprofitable, and time only increased social, political, economic and cultural differences (see Tuckahoe-Cohee) between the two sections of Virginia."
21524,47,west_virginia,21524,"In 1829, a constitutional convention was convened in Richmond to consider reforms to the obsolete constitution of Virginia."
21525,47,west_virginia,21525,Philip Doddridge of Brooke County defended the cause of the Western Virginians seeking a more democratic government framework.
21526,47,west_virginia,21526,"However, Western reforms have been rejected by the leaders of the eastern Alleghenies, who ""has thrown themselves into political power in an effort to preserve their way of life as a plantation dependent on the slavery of the Blacks."""
21527,47,west_virginia,21527,Virginia's leaders have maintained a property qualification to have the right to vote that effectively deprives poor farmers in the West whose families have done much of the agricultural work themselves.
21528,47,west_virginia,21528,"In addition, the 1829–30 convention granted slave counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population by allocating state representation to the United States House of Representatives."
21529,47,west_virginia,21529,"As a result, all but one of the counties west of the Alleghenies voted to reject the constitution, which was nevertheless adopted because of the support of the East."
21530,47,west_virginia,21530,The inability of the Eastern planter elite to carry out constitutional reforms exacerbated the East-West sectarianism existing in Virginia and contributed to the subsequent division of Virginia.
21531,47,west_virginia,21531,"The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850-1951, the Reform Convention, addresses a number of important issues for Western Virginians."

21536,47,west_virginia,21536,"The representation of Senators was arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats, with the West receiving twenty and the East thirty senators."
21537,47,west_virginia,21537,"This was made acceptable to the West by a provision that required the General Assembly to resume representation on the basis of the white population in 1865, or put the issue on the agenda of a public referendum."
21538,47,west_virginia,21538,"But the East has also given itself a tax advantage by requiring real and real property taxes, with the exception of slaves."
21539,47,west_virginia,21539,"Slaves under the age of 12 are not taxed and slaves over that age are taxed at only $300, a fraction of their real value."
21540,47,west_virginia,21540,"However, small farmers had all their property, animals and land taxed at their full value."
21541,47,west_virginia,21541,"Despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the West, the vote was 75,748 in favour and 11,063 against the new Constitution."
21542,47,west_virginia,21542,"Most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties, who did not like the compromises made for the West."
21543,47,west_virginia,21543,"Given these differences, many in the West had long considered a separate state."
21544,47,west_virginia,21544,"In particular, men such as lawyer Francis H. Pierpont of Fairmont had long flouted under the political domination of the slaves of Tidewater and Piedmont."
21545,47,west_virginia,21545,"In addition to the differences on the abolition of slavery, he and his allies felt the government of Virginia ignored and refused to spend funds for the necessary internal improvements in the West, such as spindles and railways."
21546,47,west_virginia,21546,West Virginia was the only state in the Union to separate from a confederate state (Virginia) during the American civil war.
21547,47,west_virginia,21547,"In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the 1861 Virginia Secession Agreement voted for the secession of the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwest corner (which eventually became West Virginia) only 17 voted in favour of the secession order, while 30 voted against (with two abstentions)."
21548,47,west_virginia,21548,"Almost immediately after this vote, a mass meeting in Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to an assembly to meet at Wheeling on May 13, 1861."
21549,47,west_virginia,21549,"At the first meeting, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, although more than a third of the delegates were from the North Panhandle region."
21550,47,west_virginia,21550,Soon there was a division of feelings.
21551,47,west_virginia,21551,"Some delegates led by John S. Carlile favoured the immediate formation of a new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, since Virginia's secession had not yet been adopted by the required referendum (as happened on 23 May), such action would constitute a revolution against the United States."
21552,47,west_virginia,21552,"The convention decided that if the Virginians adopted the secession order (of which there was no doubt), another convention comprising the elected members of the legislature would meet at Wheeling in June 1861."
21553,47,west_virginia,21553,"On May 23, 1861, the secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted in favour."
21554,47,west_virginia,21554,"The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on 11 June and stated that, since the Secession Convention had been called without popular consent, all its acts were null and void and all those who had acceded to it had left their offices."
21555,47,west_virginia,21555,"The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never really elected by public vote to act on behalf of Western Virginia."
21556,47,west_virginia,21556,"Of its 103 members, 33 had been elected to the Virginia General Assembly on 23 May."
21557,47,west_virginia,21557,"These included state senators on standby whose four-year terms had begun in 1859, and others who had left their offices to meet at Wheeling."
21558,47,west_virginia,21558,"Other members ""were chosen even more irregularly – some at mass meetings, some by county committee, and some were apparently self-designated."""
21559,47,west_virginia,21559,A law on the reorganization of the Government was adopted on 19 June.
21560,47,west_virginia,21560,"The next day, the delegates of the assembly chose Francis H. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, and elected other officers of a rival state government and two American senators (Willy and Carlile) to replace the secessionists before adjourning."
21561,47,west_virginia,21561,"The Washington federal government, D.C., quickly recognized the new government and sat on the two new senators."
21562,47,west_virginia,21562,"Thus, there were two state governments in Virginia: one promising allegiance to the United States and the other to Confederation."
21563,47,west_virginia,21563,"The second Wheeling Convention had been suspended until 6 August, then met on 20 August and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new State and a convention to govern a constitution if the vote were to be in favour."
21564,47,west_virginia,21564,"In the elections of 24 October 1861, 18,408 votes were cast for the new State and only 781 against."
21565,47,west_virginia,21565,"The results of the elections were questioned, as the Union army occupying the area and the Union troops were stationed in numerous polls to prevent the Confederate sympathizers from voting."
21566,47,west_virginia,21566,"It was also election day for local offices, and elections were also held in confederate soldiers' camps, which elected rival state officials, such as Robert E. Cowan."
21567,47,west_virginia,21567,Most of the pro-state votes came from 16 counties around the North Panhandle.
21568,47,west_virginia,21568,"More than 50,000 votes were cast on the secession order, but the vote on state status did not exceed 19,000 votes."
21569,47,west_virginia,21569,"In Ohio County, which is home to Wheeling, only a quarter of registered voters voted."
21570,47,west_virginia,21570,"In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote at all, since two thirds of West Virginia's territory had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to Richmond."
21571,47,west_virginia,21571,Votes in the counties in favour of secession were most often cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties.
21572,47,west_virginia,21572,"Despite this controversy, delegates (including many Methodist ministers) met to draft a new Constitution for the new state, beginning on 26 November 1861."
21573,47,west_virginia,21573,"During this constitutional convention, one Mr. Lamb from Ohio County and one Mr. Carskadon claimed that in Hampshire County, out of only 195 votes, 39 were expressed by state citizens; the others were presented illegally by Union soldiers."
21574,47,west_virginia,21574,One of the key figures was Rev.
21575,47,west_virginia,21575,"Gordon Battelle, who also represented Ohio County, and who proposed resolutions to create public schools, as well as to limit the movement of slaves to the new state, and to gradually abolish slavery."
21576,47,west_virginia,21576,"The education proposal was successful, but the convention tabled the proposals for slavery before completing its work on 18 February 1862."
21577,47,west_virginia,21577,"The new constitution is more inspired by Ohio than Virginia, adopting a model of township government rather than Virginia's ""courthouse cliques"" than Carlile criticizes, and a compromise required by the Kanawha region (lawyers Charleston Benjamin Smith and Brown) allows counties and municipalities to vote for subsidies for railways or other improvement agencies."
21578,47,west_virginia,21578,"The resulting instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on April 11, 1862."
21579,47,west_virginia,21579,On 13 May 1862 the reorganized state legislature approved the formation of the new state.
21580,47,west_virginia,21580,A request for admission to the Union was made to Congress by Senator Waitman Willey of the restored Virginia government.
21581,47,west_virginia,21581,"However, Senator Carlile sought to sabotage the bill by first trying to widen the boundaries of the new state to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then defeating the Willey Amendment at home."
21582,47,west_virginia,21582,"On December 31, 1862, an enabling law was approved by President Abraham Lincoln, who admitted West Virginia, provided that a provision for the progressive abolition of slavery was included in its constitution (as Rev."
21583,47,west_virginia,21583,Battelle had urged in the Wheeling Intelligence and also wrote to Lincoln).
21584,47,west_virginia,21584,"While many felt that West Virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln expressed his opinion on the admission of West Virginia by concluding that ""the organ that consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Virginia Legislative Assembly"" and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and timely."
21585,47,west_virginia,21585,"The congress was reconvened on 12 February 1863, and the request for the abolition of the federal enabling law was met."
21586,47,west_virginia,21586,"The revised Constitution was adopted on 26 March 1863 and on 20 April 1863 President Lincoln issued a proclamation in which he admitted the state 60 days later, on 20 June 1863."
21587,47,west_virginia,21587,"Meanwhile, officers for the new state were chosen, while Gov."
21588,47,west_virginia,21588,"Pierpont moved his pro-Union capital Virginia to Alexandria occupied by the Union, where he affirmed and exercised jurisdiction over all other counties of Virginia on federal lines."
21589,47,west_virginia,21589,The constitutionality of the formation of the new state was then referred to the United States Supreme Court in Virginia v. West Virginia.
21590,47,west_virginia,21590,"Berkeley and Jefferson counties, located on the Potomac east of the mountains, in 1863, with the consent of the reorganized Virginia government, voted in favour of annexation to Western Virginia."
21591,47,west_virginia,21591,Many voters in counties strongly in favour of secessionists were absent from the Confederate Army at the time of the vote and refused to recognize the transfer upon their return.
21592,47,west_virginia,21592,"The Virginia General Assembly abrogated the act of secession and, in 1866, brought an action against West Virginia asking the court to declare the counties part of Virginia, which would have declared the admission of West Virginia as an unconstitutional state."
21593,47,west_virginia,21593,"Meanwhile, on 10 March 1866, Congress adopted a joint resolution recognizing the transfer."
21594,47,west_virginia,21594,The Supreme Court ruled in favour of West Virginia in 1870.
21595,47,west_virginia,21595,"During the civil war, General Union forces George B. McClellan took possession of most of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating in the Battle of Rich Mountain, and control of the Union was never again seriously threatened."
21596,47,west_virginia,21596,"In 1863, General John D. Imboden, with 5,000 confederates, raided much of the state and burned the Pierpont library, although Senator Willey escaped their control."
21597,47,west_virginia,21597,"Bands of guerrillas burned and looted in some sections, and were not completely removed until after the end of the war."
21598,47,west_virginia,21598,"Eastern Panhandle counties were more affected by the war, as military control of the area changed hands several times."
21599,47,west_virginia,21599,"The region that became Western Virginia has indeed provided about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies, about 22,000 to 25,000 each."
21600,47,west_virginia,21600,"In 1865, the Wheeling government found it necessary to remove the voting rights of those returning to their country in order to retain control."
21601,47,west_virginia,21601,"James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said that if it were not enacted, he would lose the election by 500 votes."
21602,47,west_virginia,21602,"The property of the Confederates could also be confiscated and, in 1866, a constitutional amendment depriving all those who had helped and comforted the Confederation was adopted."
21603,47,west_virginia,21603,The addition of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution prompted a reaction.
21604,47,west_virginia,21604,"The democratic party gained control in 1870, and in 1871 the constitutional amendment of 1866 was repealed."
21605,47,west_virginia,21605,"The first steps towards this change, however, had been taken by the Republicans in 1870."
21606,47,west_virginia,21606,"On August 22, 1872, a new constitution was adopted."
21607,47,west_virginia,21607,"From the reconstruction, and for several decades thereafter, the two states challenged the state's share of the debts of the pre-war government of Virginia, which had been primarily committed to financing the improvement of public infrastructure, such as canals, roads and railways, under the direction of the Virginia Board of Public Works."
21608,47,west_virginia,21608,"The Virginians, under the leadership of former Confederate General William Mahone, formed a political coalition based on this: the Readjuster Party."
21609,47,west_virginia,21609,"Although the first constitution of West Virginia provided for the acceptance of part of Virginia's debt, the negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were unsuccessful and, in 1871, Virginia financed two thirds of the debt and arbitrarily attributed the rest to West Virginia."
21610,47,west_virginia,21610,"The issue was finally resolved in 1915 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50."
21611,47,west_virginia,21611,The last instalment of this amount was paid in 1939.
21612,47,west_virginia,21612,"After the reconstruction, the new 35th State benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other economic activity."
21613,47,west_virginia,21613,"Saltpeter caves had been used throughout Appalachia for ammunition production; the border between West Virginia and Virginia included the Saltpeter Trail, a chain of limestone caves containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were returned and sold to the government."
21614,47,west_virginia,21614,"The trail extends from Pendleton County to the western terminus of the road in the city of Union, in Monroe County."
21615,47,west_virginia,21615,"Nearly half of these caves are on the west side of Virginia, including the organ cave and Haynes Cave."
21616,47,west_virginia,21616,"At the end of the 18th century, Haynes Cave saltpeter miners found large animal bones in the deposits."
21617,47,west_virginia,21617,"They were sent by a local historian and a border soldier, Colonel John Stuart, to Thomas Jefferson."
21618,47,west_virginia,21618,"The bones were called Megalonyx jeffersonii, or big claw, and became known as Jefferson's three-finger sloth."
21619,47,west_virginia,21619,It was declared an official fossil of the state of West Virginia in 2008.
21620,47,west_virginia,21620,"The official rock of the state of West Virginia is bituminous coal, and the official gemstone of the state is silicified fossil of the Mississippi Lithostrotionella coral."
21621,47,west_virginia,21621,"Limestone has also produced a useful, generally small, quarry industry, and softer, high-calcium seams have been burned to produce industrial lime."
21622,47,west_virginia,21622,"This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years, a specific portion of the C & O railway carried limestone to Clifton Forge, Virginia, as an industrial stream."
21623,47,west_virginia,21623,"The extraction of salt had been under way since the 18th century, although it had played largely in the era of the American civil war, when the red salt of Kanawha County was a valuable commodity of the forces of the first Confederation and then of the Union."
21624,47,west_virginia,21624,"In the years that followed, more sophisticated extraction methods would restore the role of West Virginia as the leading salt producer."
21625,47,west_virginia,21625,"However, in the second half of the 19th century, there was an even larger treasure that was not yet developed: bituminous coal."
21626,47,west_virginia,21626,It would feed much of the industrial revolution in the United States and the steam ships of many of the world's marines.
21627,47,west_virginia,21627,Residents (indigenous and first European settlers) had long known the underlying coal and could use it for heating and fuel.
21628,47,west_virginia,21628,"For a long time, however, ""personal"" or artisanal mining was the only practical development."
21629,47,west_virginia,21629,"After the war, with the new railways came a practical method of transporting large quantities of coal to the expansion of American and export markets."
21630,47,west_virginia,21630,"As the anthracite mines in northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play during the same period, investors and industrialists focused their interest on Western Virginia."
21631,47,west_virginia,21631,Geologists such as Dr. David T. Ansted studied potential coal fields and invested in land-based and early mining projects.
21632,47,west_virginia,21632,"In 1872, the completion of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) railway across the state to the new town of Huntington on the Ohio River opened access to the New River coalfield."
21633,47,west_virginia,21633,"Soon, the C&O was building its huge coal wharf at Newport News, Virginia, on the large harbour of Hampton Roads."
21634,47,west_virginia,21634,"In 1881, the new owners of the former Atlantic Railway, Mississippi and Ohio (AM&O), which extended south of Virginia from Norfolk, had clear views of the state of the mountains, where the owners owned vast lands."

21999,48,wisconsin,21999,The Oneota can be the ancestors of modern Ioway and Ho-Chunk nations who shared the Wisconsin region with the Menomines at the time of European contact.
22000,48,wisconsin,22000,"Other Amerindian groups living in Wisconsin include the Ojibwa, Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo and Pottawatomy, who migrated to East Wisconsin between 1500 and 1700."

22013,48,wisconsin,22013,"The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, called the city ""La Baye"", however the British fur traders called it ""Green Bay"", because water and shore presupposed green shades in early spring."

22015,48,wisconsin,22015,The British-dominated region has virtually no negative effect on French residents because the British need the cooperation of French fur traders and French fur traders need the good will of the British.
22016,48,wisconsin,22016,"During the French occupation of the region, licences for the fur trade had only been issued to select groups of traders, while the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible in the region, issued licences for the fur trade freely to both British residents and French residents."

22022,48,wisconsin,22022,"However, the British remained in control until the end of the War of 1812, the outcome of which finally established an American presence in the region."

22024,48,wisconsin,22024,"The prospect of an easy mineral wealth has attracted immigrants from across the United States and Europe to lead deposits at Mineral Point, Dodgeville and nearby areas."
22025,48,wisconsin,22025,"Some miners found refuge in the holes they had dug, and gained the nickname of ""badgers"", leading to the identity of Wisconsin as ""Bagger State""."
22026,48,wisconsin,22026,The sudden influx of white miners caused tensions with the local American indigenous population.
22027,48,wisconsin,22027,The Winnebago War of 1827 and the Black Hawk War of 1832 culminated in the forced withdrawal of Amerindians from most parts of the state.

22043,48,wisconsin,22043,"Dewey, an abolitionist, was the first of many Wisconsin governors to plead against the spread of slavery in new states and territories."
22044,48,wisconsin,22044,The policy at the beginning of Wisconsin was defined by the largest national debate on slavery.
22045,48,wisconsin,22045,"Free from its foundation, Wisconsin has become a centre of northern abolitionism."
22046,48,wisconsin,22046,"The debate became particularly intense in 1854, after Joshua Glover, a runaway slave of Missouri, was captured at Racine."
22047,48,wisconsin,22047,"Glover was detained under the Fugitive Slaves Act, but a host of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was detained and helped him escape to Canada."

22055,48,wisconsin,22055,Wisconsin briefly became one of the country's leading wheat producers in the 1860s.
22056,48,wisconsin,22056,"Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominates the high-wooded sections of northern Wisconsin, and sawmills arise in cities such as La Crosse, Eau Claire and Wausau."
22057,48,wisconsin,22057,These economic activities have had serious environmental consequences.
22058,48,wisconsin,22058,"By the end of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and logging had deforested most of the State."

22071,48,wisconsin,22071,"Wisconsin took part in several political extremes from the middle to the end of the 20th century, ranging from Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusades in the 1950s to radical protests against the UW-Madison war that culminated in the Sterling Hall bombing in August 1970."
22072,48,wisconsin,22072,The state undertook social welfare reform under the leadership of Republican Governor Tommy Thompson in the 1990s.
22073,48,wisconsin,22073,"The state economy also underwent further transformations towards the end of the 20th century, as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favour of a service economy based on medicine, education, agro-industry and tourism."
22074,48,wisconsin,22074,"Two U.S. Navy combat ships, BB-9 and BB-64, were appointed to the State."
22075,48,wisconsin,22075,"In 2011, Wisconsin was the subject of some controversy when newly elected Governor Scott Walker successfully proposed, passed and passed the Wisconsin 10 Act, 2011, which made significant changes in the areas of collective bargaining, compensation, retirement, health insurance and sick leave for public sector employees, among other things."
22076,48,wisconsin,22076,"A series of major protests by union supporters took place that year in response to the changes, and Walker survived a recall election held the following year, becoming the first governor of U.S. history to do so."
